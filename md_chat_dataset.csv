3,Hey what's up do use Google very often?I really love the company and was surprised to hear that it was founded back in 1998.,Curious to dive deeper
3,i think everyone must use it daily! its become ingrained in every day life,Neutral
3,Agreed. The Google headquarters in Mountain View California is nicknamed the Google Plex.,Neutral
3," thats funny. The current CEO is Sundar Pichai, i didnt know Larry Page was replaced",Neutral
3,Oh yeah I didn't know that either. I also want to go to google Plex to see the goats who mow their lawn by eating it.,Surprised
3,say what now?? they have that??,Surprised
3,Yeah apparently lol! They do that instead of hiring people to mow!,Happy
3,thats both funny and i guess imaginative. leave it to a huge tech company to employ actual goats!,Surprised
3,Yeah exactly I am sure they are cheaper. One thing I bet they couldn't exploit is fish. I think fish are so cool there is actually a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.,Surprised
3,i had rememered hearing about that before. Immortatlity is wasted on a jellyfish haha. did you know a seahorse is the only fish that has an actual neck?,Neutral
3,That is so funny I guess I never considered a seahorse a fish. The black swallower fish sounds a lot like a snake because it can eat pray that is so large.,Surprised
3,i guess they live up to their name then!,Surprised
3,It seems they do. I also didn't know that there was a difference with how freshwater and saltwater fish drink.,Surprised
3,thats crazy. i wonder why fresh water ones only use osmosis?,Neutral
3,Yeah and saltwater fish are lucky because they can do that and drink through their mouth's.,Curious to dive deeper

4,Hi!  do you like to dance?,Neutral
4,I love to dance a lot. How about you?,Happy
4," I am really bad, but it is a good time.",Neutral
4,Dancing is a lot of fun. Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer?,Happy
4," I heard that, winning Cha Cha championships and everything!",Surprised
4,Yes that is amazing. He won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship back in 1958 in fact.,Surprised
4,I always just thought of him as a martial arts legend.  Now he is a dance legend of sorts too!,Neutral
4,Yeah!! That is correct. He was a fantastic martial artist. Did you know that Tupac danced ballet in high school?,Curious to dive deeper
4," Yeah!  He was the mouse king in the Nutcracker.  Thats pretty cool, I would definitely never have guessed that about him.",Neutral

4,That is crazy!  That can't be cheap for them.,Surprised
4,No. I think its very expensive for them to be professional ballet dancers based on this.,Neutral
4," It has been great chatting but I must go!  Gotta go get my Bruce Lee on, the martial arts part...  definitely not the dance.",Neutral
4,Ha Ha!!! It was so nice chatting with you as well!! Have a nice day!!! Bye,Happy
4,Bye,Neutral

5,Yes and did get used so that is good. Nice chat,Happy
6," hi, do you use google much?",Curious to dive deeper
6," Yes, I think it is the most effective search engine. How about you? Do you use gmail?",Curious to dive deeper
6,Yes. a google search takes more computing power than sending astronauts tot he moon,Surprised
6,And before on Google moon they used to use cheese for close ups!,Surprised
6,do you know how google maps calculates traffic?,Surprised
6," I am not sure, how do they do this?",Curious to dive deeper
6,they track how fast android devices are moving,Curious to dive deeper
6,Interesting! Google really is taking over the world. Their data center electricity use is 0.01 percent of all worldwide electricity.,Surprised
6,Yes for sure they are. they have grown so much over the years,Curious to dive deeper
6,But I like that they like to have fun too. Have you ever typed askew into Google?,Curious to dive deeper
6,No I have. What does the results turn?,Curious to dive deeper
6,You should try it! It tilts the page. Another fun thing Google does is call new employees nogglers. They have to wear propeller beanies. Or is this mean?,Curious to dive deeper
6," Oh, not sure about that really. People say it is a great place to work at though",Curious to dive deeper
6," Before Google launched gmail, that was the name of a free email service offered by garfield's website. That actually seems more fun.",Surprised
6,I know now everytime I open gmail I think of garfield,Curious to dive deeper
6," Speaking of cats, I would love to get a glow in the dark one. They have those in South Korea.",Happy
6,Wow. In Japana and Taiwan there are cat cafes where you can play with them,Curious to dive deeper
6,That seems fun! That reminds me of the Anderson house bed and breakfast in Minnesota. They used to offer a free cat for the night when you booked a room.,Surprised
6,wow. there is a town in alaska where the mayor of the town is a cat,Surprised
6," That is cool. Cats are a pretty smart species. There has not been a cat species extinction in 10,000 years.",Surprised
6,They are indeed very smart and that proves it. Nice chatting with you.,Happy
7,Do you like comic books?,Curious to dive deeper
7,I do like comic books!,Happy
7,Have you heard that Harley Quinn has a new comic book series coming out?,Curious to dive deeper
7," I have not heard that.  I know that comic book legend Stan Lee used to end every phone conversation with ""excelsior!""",Happy
7,I've heard that too. Did you know that the DC in DC comics stands for Detective Comics?,Curious to dive deeper
7,I just read that today.  The largest comic book market is in Japan.  I believe it.  My son loves to read those mangas.,Happy
7,I would love to go there. I used to like reading Manga too.,Curious to dive deeper
7,The manga market is Japan is valued at $6 to $7 billion dollars!,Happy
7,That is wild! Did you know that Michigan State University library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world?,Curious to dive deeper
7," I didn't know that.  I wonder how many people use it.  By comparison to Japan, the US comic book market in the US and Canada is $1.09 billion!",Happy
7," That's crazy, Japan is way more into comic books than America it seems. ",Curious to dive deeper
7," I agree!  The Marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth -199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book multiverse, earth-616!",Happy
7," That's pretty wild. Marvel published a ""generic comic book,"" in order to trademark the names ""superhero"" and ""super-villain."" That was pretty smart of them. ",Curious to dive deeper
7,No doubt!  Do you know much about the planets or the universe?,Curious to dive deeper
7,I know a little bit. I've heard that Venus does not tilt.,Curious to dive deeper
7,That interesting.  Uranus is different to.  It actually rotates sideways and rolls around the sun rather than spins like the other planets.,Happy
7,That's really interesting. I've also heard that Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun.,Curious to dive deeper
7,It must be pretty big then!  I wouldn't want to ever visit the unnamed planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph!,Happy
7,I don't see that being a pleasant place. It's even 2000 degree weather. That sounds like hell to me!,Curious to dive deeper
7,Hahah That's a good way of putting it!,Happy
7," Well I have to get to work, I hope you have a good day. It was nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
8,Can you believe there is stars that can be cold enough to be touched ? The universe is so diverse.,Surprised
8,Its amazing and ever evolving.,Surprised
8,Yeah and there is even places that exist but we never will be able to see because they are too far away.,Surprised
8,They are saying space pulls galaxies outside of universe that we could see,Neutral
8," Yes that is what I was saying, albeit I doubt that there is only one electron in the universe like some people say. ",Surprised
8,I don't see anything supporting or denying that theory so we would never know for sure.,Curious to dive deeper
8," Yeah, but only one ? For all the universe ? It does not seems logic ...",Surprised
8,There is only one sun that warms earth and all other planets so why not just one electron?,Curious to dive deeper
8," Because an electron is part of matter, the water you drink, the chair you sit on. Saying there is only 1 electron in the universe is like saying there is 1 grain of wheat in your bread.  ",Surprised
8,It makes sense when you put it that way but in terms of that universe size the electron could be very big.,Disgusted
8,Maybe they did mean to say that our universe is contained in an electron in another universe ?,Curious to dive deeper
8," I don't know but I am at the end of knowledge on this subject. What do you think about the facts of comics? I would have thought US invented them, but it's Japan or UK.",Neutral
8," Japan has a great printing history, I am not surprised about this. Do you read comics books ? I have read a few but not about super-heroes. ",Curious to dive deeper
8," I used to in my childhood but not any more, I used to love inspector Gadget. ",Happy
8,Was Inspect Gadget a comics on Paper or a cartoon on TV ? I was talking about what Marvel is publishing.,Curious to dive deeper
8,On Paper and yes I do recall seeing Super-hero and Hulk books.,Curious to dive deeper
8," I think that Hulk is in the Marvel universe. But like I said, I never read anything from Marvel nor DC comics. ",Curious to dive deeper
8," Right me neither, there were so many good choices of comics when I was growing up. ",Curious to dive deeper
8," Not where I lived, if I want to read a comic book, I had to go to the library. But as I think about it Tintin is a comic book, so I was wrong, I did read a lot of them when I was young but they were European.  ",Surprised
8," Mine all time favorite was Bozo the clown, books and TV both. ",Neutral
8," I did saw a lot of cartoons on TV, but I don't think that considered as a comic book. have a nice day. ",Happy
9,Are you a Star Wars fan? I need to rewatch the OT and the prequels so I can watch the subsequent stuff for the first time and understand what's going on.,Curious to dive deeper
9," Hi! Yes, I am a huge fan of Star Wars! I also loved how it was the first major movie to be dubbed in Navajo! I think that is so cool!",Happy
9," Yeah, that's wild. I guess it takes a pretty small audience to pay for the translation work.",Curious to dive deeper
9," Agreed. Isn't it also funny James Earl Jones only spent two and half hours recording his lines for Darth Vader? I also can't believe he was only paid $7500! Geez, that's pocket change.",Surprised
9,$7500 is amazingly low. I guess since Darth Vader was masked Jones could just record everything at once in the studio.,Neutral
9," Agreed. Can you also believe that George Lucas' wife at the time, Marcia, won an academy award for her editing on Star Wars and yet George Lucas didn't win an academy award for directing. That is just downright unbelievable!",Surprised
9,A lot of people think the OT was so much better than the prequels because of her influence.,Neutral
9," Yeah it was because of her that so many major changes were made like Leia's good luck kiss, Obi Wan's death, etc. She was truly a big influence!",Neutral
9," I remember thinking just about everything in the prequels' timeline was off, based on the mental version of the past the OT led us to construct. But I'd have to rewatch to nail it down.",Curious to dive deeper
9,Yeah I would have to watch it as well! So are you also a fan of Chewbacca? I love him. I think it's funny there's a bat species called the Chewbacca bat. That's hilarious!,Surprised
9,I never felt strongly about Chewbacca one way or the other TBH. But I've got to google a picture of that bat to see what it looks like!,Curious to dive deeper
9,I would like to see it as well. Did you know Chewbacca actually had a wife and two boys? That's pretty interesting!,Neutral
9,I vaguely recall reading something in the Star Wars fictional universe where a young Han Solo stayed with Chewbacca and his mom in their home.,Curious to dive deeper
9," That's so weird, isn't it? Ha! Are you one of the fans who believes both r2d2 and Chewbacca were secret rebel agents? I kind of think it's an interesting theory. ",Curious to dive deeper
9," I wish I knew enough about the background to have an opinion, but the last Star Wars I watched was Episode III, when it came out on video. I really need to rewatch to refresh my memory of it. ",Curious to dive deeper
9," Same here! Like, I also had forgotten that before his companionship with Chewbacca, Hans Solo was an imperial lieutenant!",Neutral
9," Yeah, I don't remember that at all. He definitely doesn't seem like the type.",Neutral
9," Indeed he doesn't. But I've always liked Chewbacca because he reminded me of a giant dog. Ha! Speaking of dogs, I think it's cool that dogs, along with elephants, are the only animals that understand pointing!",Neutral
9," I wouldn't be surprised if cats understood it but just didn't care, LOL.",Happy
9," Ha! No kidding. Speaking of dogs and cats, I like how Google prefers dogs over cats and even states in their code of conduct that they're a dog company! That is awesome!",Happy
9," Yeah, that's a weird official policy for what's supposed to be a neutral search engine! Nice chatting with you.",Happy
10," Naming a cloned cat ""copy cat"", that's cute.",Neutral
10,You must have ESP. I was going to tell you teh same thing! I have a sad story to tell there are less tigers living in the wild in Asia than as pets in the US.,Sad
10,Really? That's awful to hear!,Surprised
10,Of Roosevelt's 20 pets two were a bear and hyena!,Surprised
10," Whoa, cool! I know he seemed to be quite the animal lover.",Surprised
10," And there are more pets in Japan than there are children under 15. You can't be a pets ""OWNER"" in Boulder but you can be their guardian.  ",Surprised
10,I have a pet. I am an ailurophile meaning I love cats.,Curious to dive deeper
10,Cool word! Did you know there are 20 quintillion animal varieties on Earth?,Surprised
10,That is a lot! And in 2002 Germany gave them legal rights.,Curious to dive deeper
10," Yeah, and the Loch Ness monster is protected under the 1912 Scottish Animal Protection Act.",Surprised
10,I wonder if the immortal jellyfish needs protecting... being immortal and all.,Curious to dive deeper
10," Lol...speaking of water animals, did you know that hiccoughs are a left over from evolution when we had gills?",Surprised
10," Maybe that connection is part of why 84% of human disease genes have counterparts in zebrafish, too... hmm.",Curious to dive deeper
10,Hmm? Good theory. Seeing that the most popular pets are cats and dogs it is no surprise that they are commonly used for therapy in hospitals.,Curious to dive deeper
10," Well, they are good at helping people adjust to new situations, too.",Happy
10," Yes, like for elderly who are without companions.",Curious to dive deeper
10," Or people with anxiety and depression, or kids with autism.",Curious to dive deeper
10," Yes, a seahorse wouldn't be very good for that purpose. Did you know seahorses are the only fish with a neck?",Surprised
10,I don't think a black swallower fish would be good as a companion pet either because it can eat prey twice its length!,Surprised
10,That would freak me out! But I bet it catches that prey using its acoustic communication!,Curious to dive deeper
10,Could be. Fish are cool like that. I think it's neat that amphibians and reptiles and birds and mammals all had the same ancestry with fish.,Curious to dive deeper
10,I wonder if reptiles are considered ectothermic like most fish?,Curious to dive deeper
10," That would be a good thing to know, especially because some of them make good pets.",Curious to dive deeper
10," Yep, but I don't know if walking a gecko would give the same health benefits as walking a dog",Curious to dive deeper
10,Probably not. Dog walking is good because it gives companionship and exercise at the same time.,Neutral
10," Hey, did you know the first marine predator was the shark? They developed in the Silurian period.",Curious to dive deeper
10,Very interesting. I wonder how many aquatic species have gone extinct since then...,Curious to dive deeper
10,Or have evolved into other species. The shark has a higher core temperature than other fish because it is an active swimmer.,Curious to dive deeper
10,That makes sense. I always thought sharks were pretty interesting because they have cartilage instead of bone.,Curious to dive deeper
10," Yes, fascinating fact! Tuna also hold a higher core temperature. They are in the same class as shark because they are also active swimmers.",Curious to dive deeper
10," Tuna can get quite large, too. It's cool how big some fish get.",Curious to dive deeper
10,One more before we go...did you know domesticated animals develop a white patch on their forehead?,Neutral
10,Yeah. that is a pretty cool way to know they are domesticated rather than wild.,Curious to dive deeper
10,Very cool chatting with you. Did you know there are 6331 groups of genes? They are common to all living animals!,Surprised
10,It was a cool exercise in zoology chatting with you.,Curious to dive deeper
11,I think its sad to have to part with a pet due to allergies and couple conflict like in the Dear Amy section.,Sad
11,That is sad. Do you have pets? The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat.,Surprised
11," Yes, I have a dog.  Sounds like in the Dear Amy that they do everything tit for tat. The cat owner states that her fiance has to get rid of his saltwater fish if she gets rid of her cat.  That's not necessarily fair though I don't think.  They seem like they may struggle as a couple in the future.",Surprised
11,Yeah that's a bit dramatic! A cat lover is known as an ailurophile and a dog lover is known as a cynophile.,Surprised
11,Allergies can be serious to people.  I understand his reserve of having a cat.,Surprised
11," Me too. A pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, protection, or entertainment. No one should have to be made uncomfortable by a pet in the house.",Neutral
11," I'm sure she loves the pet, but she has to make a choice if the pet is harming her fiance.",Curious to dive deeper
11,Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described. I'm sure they can find one to agree on.,Surprised
11,Did you ever hear that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated?  That's a new one to me.,Surprised
11," That's interesting! Of the 1.5 million species, 1 million are insects! Yuck!",Disgusted
11," Apparently, there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.  If you want to live forever, you can look into being a jellyfish.",Surprised
11," Fascinating! In japan, there are more pets than there are children under 15.",Surprised
11," Teddy Roosevelt had over 20 pets and his own real ""teddy"" bear along with a hyena",Curious to dive deeper
11,Wow! There are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia.,Surprised
11," I never met anyone with a tiger pet.  That is strange.  It's not legal to own pets in Boulder, Colorado but you can be their guardian.",Surprised
11," Lots of places have special animal rights. In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights.",Surprised
11,The loch ness monster is protected by 1912 Scottish provisions,Surprised
11,That's funny. It's not even a proven species. There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.,Surprised
11,Did you ever hear of people being contacted due to DNA matches?  You can opt in or out but might be connected with matches of family members,Curious to dive deeper
11," That is pretty cool. There are several companies offering DNA testing, and each seems to offer a different way of handling client privacy",Neutral
11,DNA matches could be connected via social media.,Surprised
12," hi, do you like fish?",Curious to dive deeper
12," Yes, I love fish do you?",Neutral
12,yes me too. some of them can eat prey twice their sizew,Curious to dive deeper
12," Yes, did you know seahorses only fish to have a neck?",Neutral
12," that is so cool, and the males carry the young in that species",Curious to dive deeper
12," Yes, and zebrafish are very interesting.",Neutral
12,yeah did you know we use them to figure out stufffor ourselves,Curious to dive deeper
12," Yes interesting,  How about the first cloned cat named copy cat?",Neutral
12,that is cool. there is a jellyfish that is immortal,Curious to dive deeper
12," I know, really? How about our hiccups are from gills and lungs?",Neutral
12," that is a such a cool fact, we are still evolving so maybe it will eventually go away",Curious to dive deeper
12," lol, interesting to know the loch ness monster is a protected species.",Neutral
12,yet no one has really seen it to confirm its existence,Curious to dive deeper
12," I know, Also, I do believe in Japan there is less people under 15 years of age than pets.",Neutral
12,do you know how many idnividual animals are believed to be on earth?,Curious to dive deeper
12," Yes, 20 quintillion, can you believe that?Wow",Surprised
12,I do not even know how many zeros are in that number,Curious to dive deeper
12," lol, I know, I guess  the US have more tigers as pets than living wild in Asia.",Surprised
12,and Roosevelet did not have any of them,Curious to dive deeper
12,He did have a bear and hyena. Good to know you are a guardian not an owner in Colorado to pets.,Neutral
12,I like that too. nice chat,Happy
13,Hello,Happy
13,Hello.  do you have a cat?  I see that some people can be allergic to them.,Neutral
13," No, I do not.  I am actually allergic to cats.  The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat",Surprised
13," That's interesting and a little funny.  I had no idea of this, but the cat is the most popular pet in the world.  DId you know that?",Neutral
13," Wow, no I didn't know that.  There are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia.",Sad
13,Now that I had no idea of.  Did you know that some tarantulas keep frogs as pets?,Surprised
13," Wow, that's odd. Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats",Curious to dive deeper
13,I have dogs and used to have cats too but dogs are my favorite.,Neutral
13,Dogs are my favorite also.  I hope to get another one in the future.,Curious to dive deeper
13,Do you have any now?  I have two.,Curious to dive deeper
13," No, I do not.  What kind do you have?  84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish",Surprised
13,I have a beagle and a border collie.  I had no idea about that with the zebrafish. I wonder if cures can be found by using their genes.,Curious to dive deeper
13,I used to have a collie named Bimbo.  That's a great question.,Curious to dive deeper
13,Mine is named Cute Stuff.  Did you know about the fish that lives on land? I wonder what it is.,Curious to dive deeper
13," No, I didn't.  There is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal",Curious to dive deeper
13,Seriously?  I thought they just evaporated in the sun?,Surprised
13," Absolutely, There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.",Curious to dive deeper
13,And who knows how many that are undiscovered.  Animals are truly fascinating!,Happy
13," Yes, they are.  In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights.",Curious to dive deeper
13,I think that is a good thing!  I like how the netherlands is constructing wildlife bridges.,Happy
13,Me too. Thanks for the informative chat.,Curious to dive deeper
14," Hello, Did you know that there are over 1.5 million living animal species?",Curious to dive deeper
14," No, that was chock  full of interesting facts. Hiccups are residual from when we had gills and lungs? Interesting stuff.",Surprised
14," Never heard that one before, lol! There is a fish called the black swallower that is capable of eating prey twice its length and 10 times its own weight.",Curious to dive deeper
14,I knew one of those in my fraternity in college I think. I was shocked to learn there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal. Only creature on earth that can claim that here on the planet.,Surprised
14," Yeah we all know that guy! how about the loch ness monster being protected under the Scottish 1912 protection of animals act. Creatures of the great deep are extraordinary. ""The immortal Jelly fish. ",Curious to dive deeper
14," I already looked up that jellyfish on my phone. Fascinating, yes loch ness is protected and pets in Boulder, Colorado are not owned, but guarded. Interesting how different cultures handle that.",Surprised
14,Tell me about it apparently there are more U.S. Tigers living as pets than there are living in the wild in Asia.,Curious to dive deeper
14," Yes, that is sad in some ways too. Happy we're keeping them alive, probably in zoo but going extinct in the wild is a sad statement on the planet today.",Surprised
14,I agree. Germany became the first country to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed rights.,Curious to dive deeper
14," While I'm a pet owner, that going a bit far. Do you give dogs and cats rights, how about those dairy cows or cattle to be eaten. Do they get lesser rights?",Surprised
14,Very good point. My wife and I are watching Blue Planet. It's shocking some of the things that are down in the deep. they are still making discoveries every single day. Apparently the sea horse is the only fish with a neck.,Curious to dive deeper
14," Yes, and really they say we know more about the face of the moon than the bottom of the ocean. Who knows what's down there we don't know?  Maybe the Loch Ness monster's cousin.",Curious to dive deeper
14," If you ever get a chance you should check this show, there's some amazing creatures down there. 84% of genes that are associated with diseases have counterparts in the Zebrafish. ",Curious to dive deeper
14,I read that and thought the same. I wonder how similar the Zebra Fish is to humans? Can we use that in medical research?,Surprised
14," If we can i'm sure it will be preventative or medication. There's no money in cures. I didn't realize that we had already cloned a cat and named it Copy Cat, that's too funny.",Curious to dive deeper
14," Yes, the scientist in that experiment had a sense of humor. Related to domestication, I had no idea that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their foreheads. I wonder what causes that, it doesn't seem to have any evolutionary reason to me.",Neutral
14,Sounds strange. I can't fathom why anyone would want a rat for a pet. I'm a little leery of guinea pigs and ferrets. anything with red eyes you can keep.,Curious to dive deeper
14," Haha, yep. A snake doesn't seem very warm or comforting either. I don't understand why people enjoy having them as pets. And how do they find partners who accept it?",Neutral
14," Other people who like that stuff i guess, haha. Apparently Theodore Roosevelt had 20 pets including a bear and Hyena. I wonder if he played with them much? ",Curious to dive deeper
14," Well, President of the United States, I wonder if he had them in the White House? Did he have a stable for the bear out back?",Neutral
14,Some animals just should be domesticated. That white patch if true is something to ponder.,Curious to dive deeper
14," Yes indeed, interesting facts that will give me pause this weekend. That was an enjoyable conversation. Thanks and have a lovely weekend.",Curious to dive deeper
14,You as well!!,Curious to dive deeper
14,Thanks.,Happy
15," hey hows it going, do you know what the first cloned animal was?",Curious to dive deeper
15," Was it a sheep? I heard the first cloned pet was a cat, though. Its name was copy cat. That is funny!",Curious to dive deeper
15," haha ya I like that, what is also wild to me is that there are more domesticated tigers living as pets than there are wild tigers living around asia",Surprised
15," Wow, that is weird and sad. Speaking of which, did you hear about the tiger found in the duffel bag?",Curious to dive deeper
15," no that is really sad, poor tiger what happened to it? Why was it in a bag?",Curious to dive deeper
15,I guess it was being smuggled to the USA from Mexico.,Sad
15," ya I don't like that that makes me mad, do you have any pets? I guess In Japan there are more pets than there are kids under the age of fifteen",Curious to dive deeper
15," They really love their pets huh? No, I don't have any pets. Do you?",Happy
15," no we used to have a dog but we were only watching her for a bit and the owner took her away, we had lots of pets as kids though like iguanas and rabbits and such",Curious to dive deeper
15," In Boulder, Colorado you cannot own a pet. You can be their guardian though.",Surprised
15," hmm that seems dumb like its just playing with words, do you like Teddy Roosevelt? apparently he had over 20 pets, or as they say in Colorado, ""Guardians"" haha",Surprised
15," Maybe it helps people to feel more of an obligation to their pets. Shrug. Yeah, Teddy Roosevelt is an interesting guy. It's unfortunate though that people try to domesticate tigers as you mentioned. Many of the animals perish along the way from suffocation or hunger. ",Sad
15," ya that makes me really sad, what do you think about fish? I had salmon for dinner so I do think theyre tasty haha",Curious to dive deeper
15,Haha. Funny. I don't eat seafood. My mom forced me to eat salmon way too often when I was little and I grew sick of it. Haha #firstworldproblems.,Sad
15," haha ya, well I am like the black swallower fish, I could eat a salmon twice my height and ten times my weight because I love it",Happy
15,Funny. I would love to learn more about a jellyfish that is immortal.,Curious to dive deeper
15,I know they need to apply those genes to me! also weird is there is no fish except for the seahorse that has an actual neck,Curious to dive deeper
15,So seahorses are salt water right? I guess they drink water though their mouths while freshwater fish only drink through their skin.,Surprised
15," yes that would be true, also true is that 84% of human disease genes are also associated with the zebrafish, we need to study that fish too!",Surprised
15,How odd! Do you think the loch ness monster is real? It is a protected species!,Surprised
15," haha I wish it were real! that's funny they did that in 1912, maybe they knew something that we dont?",Surprised
16,What would you do if you found a baby tiger inside of a duffel bag?,Curious to dive deeper
16," I would look around to make sure Mama tiger is not in the area and looking at me with, ""Gimme back my child"" look!",Happy
16," LOL yep you don't want to be around an angry tiger mom haha. I guess they found one on the southern Border in Texas, a bag with a baby tiger that is",Surprised
16,Was it a smuggling thing?,Curious to dive deeper
16,Yes I think so unfortunately. the smuggling industry is a billion dollar trade unfortunately,Sad
16," With 20 quintillion animals in this world, why would anyone feel the need to smuggle one?",Happy
16," Haha well different animals are definitely worth different amounts, I don't think a mosquito is worth anything LOL. Why do you think animals can get white patches on their foreheads?",Curious to dive deeper
16," Once domesticated, animals develop white patches on their foreheads, likely because once indoors, they run into painted walls and doors with their heads. I know i do.",Happy
16,Haha I wonder if humans developed these white patches as well. What do you think about Germany giving constitutional rights to animals? They did that back in 2002,Surprised
16," I think German constitutional right for animals are pretty cool. Pretty, pretty . I learned about that while watching the German remake of the classic film, ""12 angry hamsters""",Happy
16," Well I'll have to watch that movie. I just think it's cool that hiccups are relics of When Animals had both lungs and gills, so next time you have the hiccups think about that LOL",Surprised
16,Does that mean putting a bag over your head while hiccupping may cause you to de-evolve? Maybe that is what happened to the Loch Ness Monster! I'm glad  she is a protected species. Hate to think someone might bag Aunt Matilda.,Happy
16," It's funny that it's protected by 1912 Scottish law, the ""protection of animals act"". hopefully that means that it's a real animal LOL but I doubt it",Surprised
16," Yeah. Aunt Matilda would make a better hag fish anyway, or maybe a seahorse, since they are the only fish with a neck. ",Happy
16,That is crazy! I also think it's crazy that there is a jellyfish breed that can never die AKA its immortal,Surprised
16," Does that mean they never get cancer, or they get cancer forever? You know, 84% of genes associated with human disease are also found in the zebrafish, but I have never seen a zebrafish with MS or Parkinson's disease...",Happy
16," Haha I haven't seen it either! Maybe some people have the black swallower fish disease, because black swallow fish Can Eat Prey twice their length and 10 times their weight haha",Surprised
16," Haha. If  freshwater fish can drink through it's skin, why don't you ever see a freshwater fish floating in a margarita?",Happy
16,Haha I wish I could drink through my skin and float in a margarita LOL. Do you have any pets by the way?,Curious to dive deeper
16," Too many to count. We've had Hamsters, snakes, scorpions, lizards, fish, cats, dogs, chickens, birds...Our apartment is getting cramped...",Happy
16," Haha that's a lot of animals! We have a dog actually, but I can't believe that there are more pet tigers in the USA than Wild Ones in Asia, a lot of people must have illegal pets here",Surprised
17,Can you recommend any movies to watch?,Curious to dive deeper
17,Do you like Star Wars ? The movie about Hans Solo just came out on Netflix.,Curious to dive deeper
17,Is that the one where its about a young Han Solo?,Neutral
17," Yeah it is the one, so Han Solo is not played by Harrison Ford, does it affect your opinion of the movie ?",Curious to dive deeper
17,Someone else can fill Harrison Fords shoes? Maybe ill check into how well this Alden guy does in the role,Neutral
17," He did a good job, but Han Solo was already young in the 1977 movie, I think it impacted negatively the movie. ",Neutral
17,Does Chewbacca appear in this movie?,Neutral
17," Yes it does, but it is not the same actor who did the other movies. I don't think that matters too much. ",Neutral
17,I like their relationshop in the movies. Chewy is a very loyal friend,Happy
17,In the canon Chewy has a family a wife and 2 sons.,Neutral
17,Thats interesting. I heard George RR Martin had an illustration that Chewie is based off of,Surprised
17," I heard that too, it was on the cover of one of his small stories. It is a peculiar creature when you think about it. ",Neutral
17,I wonder what other crazy creatures we could have had in space with Martins help. There's a giant fictional Universe that could be filled.,Curious to dive deeper
17,Would you like to  see a film with Chewbacca as the principal character ?,Neutral
17,I think it would be interesting. There are also so many comic stories that could be told. I just wonder how communication would work in such a movie,Curious to dive deeper
17," They would use subtitles. And good storytelling, like how Hans Solo seems to understand Chewie's intentions, but not his words. ",Neutral
17,Yeah its like having a dog as a best friend. But able to shoot things,Neutral
17,There was also a dog movie that opened this summer A.X.L. about a robot dog.,Neutral
17,I will have to check that one out as well. Thanks for your time. have a good day,Neutral
17," Do you like dogs ? I love them, they were one of the first domesticated animals.",Neutral
17,Yes! dogs and elephants can understand pointing,Happy
18,Good Morning! How are you today?,Curious to dive deeper
18," Well, you may be on the other side of the fence but I like neither Kanye nor Trump.",Curious to dive deeper
18,I couldn't have said it any better lol. That was such an odd meeting between them two a couple months ago!,Curious to dive deeper
18," I recall the time that Kanye stood up to a President when he perceived racism, now he seems to have flipped.  I guess they money makes a big difference,",Surprised
18,A very big difference. He even thinks AIDS is a man-made disease!,Curious to dive deeper
18," People love a good conspiracy story.  I think that is how Trump does so well, people believe in the Deep State, and such.",Sad
18,I agree! What kind of music do you like to listen to?,Curious to dive deeper
18," I'm a kid of the eighties and nineties,  I never really moved on from that alternative rock scene.",Curious to dive deeper
18,Same here! I think rap has been a major significance in the last twenty years though huh?,Curious to dive deeper
18," There has been the odd rap song that I like, but for me it's cultural.  I'm just not from the environment most rappers are and can't appreciate their point of view.",Curious to dive deeper
18,I agree too! I can't believe a michigan judge once delivered her ruling to eminem in the form of a rap haha.,Curious to dive deeper
18," That's kind of cool, I like it when people don't take themselves too seriously.  Like when Kanye made fun of himself on SNL.  If only he'd do it more.",Happy
18," All he has to do is talk and it happens haha. I give him props though, he once gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at a concert. However, I'm sure he told a person to stand up in a wheelchair before too.....",Curious to dive deeper
18," Funny.  Are you one for hats?  Probably not a MAGA hat, but hat's in general? ",Curious to dive deeper
18," I wear hats when I'm out hiking, but that is about it, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
18," Generally not.  I'm originally from the UK so I guess most people would associate me with a bowler hat, but never really worn any type of hat.",Neutral
18,It took me awhile to figure out what it looks like but now I know. Wasn't that the most popular hat in the old west too?,Curious to dive deeper
18," I'm guessing that is because of TV and movies, we get this idea of the way it is shown when reality is somewhat different. Being self deprecating, I'd say a dunces cap suits me well.",Happy
18,Well said! I think it suits me well too haha. That is where the conical party hat was derived from!,Curious to dive deeper
18,Or maybe we could give it to Mr West next time he wants to speak his mind to us.,Happy
18," Or just when he is walking around being the odd self he is. Anyways, I had a great chat with you, have an awesome day!",Curious to dive deeper
19,Do you like wearing hats? It has so many functions!,Curious to dive deeper
19,I don't like them on myself but I know a lot of people that can pull them off.,Neutral
19," Yes me as well. In the military hats denote a nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment.",Curious to dive deeper
19,I noticed the different hats in the military but did not know it had to do with rank.,Surprised
19," Yes they have a function to play. In the old west, the most popular hat was the bowler!",Surprised
19,Wow! They always show a stetson or something close so I'm shocked by that.,Surprised
19,Yes me as well! Tipping of ones hat arises from the knights raising their face visors. Very chivalry of them!,Happy
19,That's a very interesting fact. Did you know that until 1998 British politicians were required to wear a top hat if they were making a point of order?,Curious to dive deeper
19,Oh wow that seems kind of an old tradition. Kind of like that conical party hat which was derived from dunce caps!,Curious to dive deeper
19,That's also a strange hat. As far as old traditions in British politics I don't understand why they still wear powdered wigs in court either. So strange.,Surprised
19,Agreed. They look so silly in my opinion. A lot of rapping attire looks silly too. But the rapper Tupac was very talented as his music is in the library of congress of cultural significance.,Curious to dive deeper
19," I'm surprised they would include any rap at this point to be honest. Speaking of rap, do you know what Eminem wanted to be before he was a rapper?",Curious to dive deeper
19,I didn't know that. Very interesting. Rappers also have some odd beliefs. Like Kanye West who thinks AIDS is a man-made disease.,Surprised
19,Eminem actually wanted to be a comic book artist. Kanye West is very strange and has a lot of strange ideas.,Curious to dive deeper
19,Yes he is. But he has done some good things like giving a mic to a fan in a wheelchair at his concert.,Happy
19,That was nice of him. Did you know that Busta Rhymes did voice work in an animated movie?,Curious to dive deeper
19,Oh yeah you're right. He was the Reptar Wagon in the 1998 Rugrats Movie!,Surprised
19,Yes he was. He has a distinct voice so I don't know how I missed it initially.,Surprised
19,Good point. I didn't know rap was popular in Korea. They created a form of rap dueling called compliment battle! Well thanks for talking with me today!,Curious to dive deeper
19,I didn't know that either. That has to sound a lot different than the rap battles here. It was nice talking with you as well.,Surprised
19,Yes here they are much more agressive! Have a good one!,Happy
20,did you see that Kanye is having another kid?,Neutral
20,I heard something but I'm not really following his offspring :),Neutral
20,I saw that they are using a surrogate and only paying 70k.  I'd want a whole lot more than that!,Curious to dive deeper
20," ok, yes that's what I read... and somebody needs to explain to me, how using a surrogate really works...",Curious to dive deeper
20," Simple explanation:  They take egg from mom, Sperm from dad - put it together and then into another person.",Curious to dive deeper
20,ok... why are they doing that ? Kardashian can't have babies ?,Curious to dive deeper
20," Not sure to be honest, I'd love to know too though.",Surprised
20,I think it's just another thing to do to be on the cover of the magazine and have plenty of interviews...  this is a crazy world...,Curious to dive deeper
20," I wouldn't doubt it.  Speaking of him, do you like rap music? (trying to cover the topics! haha)",Neutral
20," lol ;) no, not really... I don't consider it to be music ;)",Curious to dive deeper
20,I mean - I think it is definitely music...but I agree not my type.,Surprised
20,Doesn't music needs melody ? ;),Surprised
20,Lots of rap does have that!,Disgusted
20,a sample on keyboard doesn't count ;),Surprised
20,I'm thinking you haven't heard much more than whats on the radio then,Surprised
20," Maybe You're right, I don't want to argue ;) not my cup of tea though :) I'm more of a blues fan. Classic rock, maybe metal. ;)",Curious to dive deeper
20,I'll pretty much listen to anything except country.  It is god awful,Curious to dive deeper
20,I don't listen to country but I don't mind it. It has it's own charm and it takes skills to play and sing country...,Curious to dive deeper
20,I suppose.  Just like most music what is played on the radio is just garbage,Disgusted
20,I agree... I mean I haven't heard anything new that's good. Maybe except Black Country Communion... great band,Curious to dive deeper
20,Can't say I know them!,Surprised
21,Do you like rap music?,Curious to dive deeper
21," I do, but I cannot tolerate Kanye West. I adore Tupac, and think it's interesting that the Library of Congress chose his music to be included because it's culturally significant.",Curious to dive deeper
21," I agree, Kanye's old music was really good. He's just out there. Just like how he thinks AIDS is a man-made disease. ",Curious to dive deeper
21," I just don't care for him. I would have loved to have been in the courtroom, the day a judge decided to give her ruling to Eminem, in rap style.",Curious to dive deeper
21," That would have been funny. Speaking of Eminem, did you know that his true dream was to become a comic book artist?",Curious to dive deeper
21," Yes, Spidey is his favorite. My brother used to love Rugrats when he was little, I only found out recently, that Busta Rhymes voiced the reptar wagon in the movie.",Curious to dive deeper
21,I didn't know that either. That's pretty interesting. Did you know that Korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle?,Curious to dive deeper
21," The compliment battle, lol. i would love to hear that. I love how people think the cowboy hat was the most popular in the old west, yet it was really the bowler.",Curious to dive deeper
21," Yeah, cowboy hats were more as working hats weren't they? Did you know that up until 1998 politicians had to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the House of Commons?",Curious to dive deeper
21," I did not. That sounds interesting. Much like the ""tip of the hat"" originates from Knights raising their visors.",Neutral
21,That is interesting too. I heard that in 1908 a law was passed limiting the length of hatpins.,Curious to dive deeper
21," They did that, so they wouldn't be used as weapons. Smart move.",Neutral
21,Yeah it is. I'd hate to be stabbed to death with a hat pin.,Curious to dive deeper
21,That does sound like a painful way to die. I do like  the fact that Kanye gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair once. He does have a few redeeming qualities.,Neutral
21,Yeah he does have a few. He once did an SNL skit mocking for interrupting awards shows....2 years before the infamous Taylor Swift incident.,Curious to dive deeper
21," I have no idea what that is, as I don't pay attention to her either. I still find it mindblowing that Big Sean turned down a scholarship to Michigan, to go rap.",Disgusted
21," Yeah that is pretty good. He made a good choice I guess, he's one of the biggest rappers in the world right now. He can always go back. ",Curious to dive deeper
21," Big Sean is? Weird, most have never heard of him. I do like Kanye's middle name, Omari,. ",Neutral
21,So his initials are K.O.W. That's funny!,Curious to dive deeper
21," I love the skits Saturday Night Live does of trump. The one of Brett Kavanaugh was hilarious, have you seen it?",Curious to dive deeper
21,Yes it was hilarious!,Curious to dive deeper
21," Thank you for chatting with me, have a nice day.",Neutral
21," I enjoyed it, I hope you have a nice day as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
22,Hello.  Did you know that there is a candy desk in the us senate?,Neutral
22," haha yeah, I heard about that. It's been there since 1968.",Happy
22,I guess they all like candy a lot!  At least it's american made. The candy is made in pennsylvania.,Neutral
22,What candy is made in Pennsylvania besides Hershey?,Curious to dive deeper
22," They've got milky way bars, mars bars, and even jelly beans!",Neutral
22," Wow, that's way cooler than the fact that they didn't let women wear pants until 1993.",Surprised
22,I know. It is so surprising to me that it took that long for two women senators to protest by wearing pants on the senate floor.,Neutral
22," They wore pantsuits, they kept it classy. haha.",Happy
22,Yes they did.  Senate is very big on tradition.  They used the same gavel for 165 years until it got cracked.,Neutral
22," Senate can be so cool, haha. Did you hear that in 1988 they arrested senators to force them to vote? I thought that sort of things only happened on House of Cards",Happy
22,I have heard about that.  One of the senators tried to escape and was carried feet first into the senate chamber by three officers!,Neutral
22," Yeah, I think that rule might be from before senators were elected. They weren't elected until 1913.",Curious to dive deeper
22,Elections are a good and a bad thing.  I've heard somewhere that the people of Ancient Athens came to the conclusion that elections would lead to an oligarchy.,Neutral
22,I think that might be because nobody votes. Voter turn out hasn't gone higher than 62% in 100 years.,Neutral
22,Maybe some people figure there's no need to vote.  Research shows that the taller candidate wins most of the time anyway.,Neutral
22,We should just have people voted in by lottery. That's what Athens used to do.,Disgusted
22,It almost seems as if that is what we have now.  I think more states than just Nevada show have a none of these candidates on their ballots.,Neutral
22," Yeah, hopefully we'll see some electoral reform soon, hopefully we can see this will improve fairness.",Neutral
22,Speaking of fairness did you know that not all men in the UK could vote until 1918?,Neutral
22," nope. But, I did hear that astronauts can vote from space.",Happy
22,That is amazing and very determined.  It's like India setting up a booth just so one person can vote in a forest that is full of lions!,Neutral
23,Hi are you a fan of Star Wars?,Curious to dive deeper
23," My son is, so I know a little bit about it.",Neutral
23,Nice!  Did you see the first movie when it came out in 1977?  I remember going to the theater to see it.,Curious to dive deeper
23," No, I did not.  My son went with his friends. Apparently, Star Wars was dubbed in Navajo in 2013.",Curious to dive deeper
23,There must have been a big enough market for them to do that.  They have the money to do it that's for sure.  Just the box office alone the Star Wars franchise has brought in over $8.5 billion dollars!,Happy
23,20th Century Fox did not think that Star Wars was going to succeed.  Do you know what happened to Star Wars' licensing and merchandising rights?,Curious to dive deeper
23,Didn't George Lucas get them somehow?,Curious to dive deeper
23," Yes, because they did not want to pay additional directing fee to Lucas. ",Curious to dive deeper
23,Nice.  He scored then big time because the entire Star Wars franchise is estimated to $65 billion dollars!,Happy
23," 20th Century Fox avoided to pay additional fee of only $500k to Lucas.  They were willing to give the licensing and merchandising to him.  Someone got fired at the company, I'll bet.",Curious to dive deeper
23,You know it!  George Lucas' wife Marcia won an academy award for editing the film!,Happy
23," I heard about it.  She was talented.  By the way,  Marcia is no longer married to Lucas.",Neutral
23,Whoa!  I didn't know that.  Maybe George doesn't have as much as that $65 billion as I thought.  Yikes.,Happy
23," It's okay.  Marcia is entitled to the money too.  She want the award, remember?",Neutral
23,Yes!  lol  James Earl Jones took only 2.5 hours to record all of the parts for Darth Vader for the original movie.,Happy
23," Sorry, what I meant was ""she won the award"". About James Earl Jones - I think he was only paid $7500 for his work.  That was not fair.",Curious to dive deeper
23,Wow.  That sure doesn't.  I wonder if he gets any licensing fees at all for Darth Vader?  On a different subject....did you know that Earth's surface is 71 percent water and 29 percent land?,Curious to dive deeper
23,I did not know the exact percentages.  Thanks for the info!,Neutral
23,On a sad note relating to those percentages....more than 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed?,Happy
23,I heard about it and we need to do something about it.,Curious to dive deeper
23,I agree.  It's sad.  I had a good time chatting with you tonight!,Happy
23,I thank you for your information - I learned a lot from you.  Have a good night.,Happy
24,Hey! Are you a Star Wars fan? I love George Lucas for creating such a cool storyline.,Happy
24,Hello! I do like Star Wars! I can't believe companies thought it would be a flop!,Surprised
24,Yeah can you believe that? Now the franchise of Star Wars is estimated to be worth $65 billion.,Surprised
24," I'm glad 20th century fox finally decided to jump on board with them! My mind is blown, George Lucas says the entire story is told by r2d2!",Curious to dive deeper
24,Wow I never knew that. Star Wars is the second highest grossing film series of all time. I wonder what the first one is?,Curious to dive deeper
24,Maybe the Harry Potter movies? I don't think the movie Blade Runner comes close to it haha. Have you seen it?,Surprised
24,Yeah I have seen all the blade runner movies. They are very cool and gritty. Ridley Scott is a good director.,Happy
24,I still have yet to see one but I want to! I like how the director and Harrison Ford debated if his character was real or not!,Curious to dive deeper
24,Now that is something that I have thought a lot about as well. That classic line at the end of the first movie delivered by the replicant was actually improvise by the actor.,Surprised
24,I think the whole concept of that movie was done right just by hearing about it! I didn't even know the composer to the soundtrack couldn't read music!,Curious to dive deeper
24," That is fascinating! Blade runner was the last sci-fi movie to be made completely analog, that is there were no computerized graphics.",Surprised
24," Wow, and now it seems like it's all computerized graphics! Speaking of crazy, isn't earth awesome?",Curious to dive deeper
24,Yes earth is epic indeed! When earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long! But that was a very long time ago!,Surprised
24,I feel like I would never be able to catch up on sleep during that time lol. I wonder at what point will earth's days be like 40 hours haha.,Curious to dive deeper
24,Yeah I've wondered that as well. I don't look forward to working that long! Earth will also be helium free by the end of the 21st-century. No more balloons for us!,Curious to dive deeper
24," I wonder if clowns will be out of jobs at that time as well haha. We do have to thank Jupiter though, they save us from many asteroids coming our way!",Curious to dive deeper
24,Do they really? I'm not really familiar with that concept. One sad statistic is that more than 80% of the earths natural forest have already been destroyed.,Sad
24,That is so sad! We are destroying the planet we live on! That is even more sad because the world is 71 percent water anyways!,Curious to dive deeper
24," Yes it is. Mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers, and other sources! Well it was lovely getting to talk with you!",Neutral
24," I agree, It was nice chatting with you as well. Have a great day!",Curious to dive deeper
24,You as well. Goodbye now!,Neutral
25," Hello, How are you? Do you like politics?",Curious to dive deeper
25," Im well.  I do like politics, I just find our current climate a bit hostile.",Neutral
25," lol, I agree with you!! I didn't know Nevada is the only state to have a none of the above voting option?",Surprised
25,I think that is a perfect option.  Sometimes there just arent good candidates.,Neutral
25,I agree!! Did you know since 1900 the taller candidate has won by 75%?,Surprised
25," yeah, I guess people think dominance with height?  Not sure how that one works.  And All bearded presdients were republican",Neutral
25," Yes, I heard that too! Good to know the astronauts in space can vote too!",Happy
25," They can.  And in certain places they might have voted for some animals.  Like a cat named Hank, third place in Virginia senate election",Neutral
25,Oh my goodness! Really. At least we don't have to go into the forest with lions like they do in Indian government!,Happy
25," I know, id be skipping out on that election.",Neutral
25,I think I would too! Too bad Richard Nixon cracked that 165 year old gavel the senate used. It must be somewhere on display.,Curious to dive deeper
25," Yeah, that has to be a piece of US history.",Neutral
25,Love the candy desk idea at the senate! Now I'm going to think about them going thru that drawer full of milky ways . mars bars and jelly beans!,Curious to dive deeper
25,It does sound like the best idea ever.  All that candy is made in Pennsylvania too.,Neutral
25," Yes, keep their sugar levels up!! lol",Happy
25,Keep them working.  LOL,Neutral
25," Yeah, can't make good choices when your sugar has dropped!  It can't believe it took until 1993 for women to wear pants on the senate floor. ",Surprised
25," I know.  If I were elected, I would be doing that first day.  Actually, Id probably bring up senate pajama day.  I m all about the comfort.",Neutral
25,I am too. Nothing worse than trying to work and feeling uncomfortable!! Good chat!!,Neutral
25,For real!  Have a good one!,Neutral
25,You too! Have a good night!!,Happy
26,Do you know much about politics?,Curious to dive deeper
26,Just the basics mostly.  Do you know what the 'candy desk' tradition is about?,Curious to dive deeper
26," I've heard one of the Senators keeps candy in their desk. Pretty cool! Did you know that Since 1900, the taller candidate has won the us presidential election 75% of the time?",Surprised
26," What! No, I did not know that, that is very interesting. ",Surprised
26," Also, Astronauts vote from space, so the rest of us have no excuse not to make it to an election. ",Surprised
26," That is crazy, but understandable.  And you are right, gives us no excuse.  Did you know about Jordan's political dealings?",Curious to dive deeper
26,I don't. Tell me more.,Curious to dive deeper
26," He was asked why he would endorse a Democrat, and he said because republicans buy shoes too.  I thought it was funny. ",Happy
26," Haha, that is funny! Nevada is the only state to have a ""none of these candidates"" voting option for presidential elections.",Surprised
26,Yeah I think the Nevada voting laws are quite odd.,Neutral
26,The voter turnout for us presidential elections hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years! That's actually more than I would guess.,Surprised
26," Well, we'll see how voting will be done twenty years from now, if they make it easier, the numbers will probably rise. ",Curious to dive deeper
26,That's true. Not all men in the uk had the right to vote until 1918.,Surprised
26,I wonder how much fraud there was in voting back in 1918.,Curious to dive deeper
26," I'm sure a lot. Elections are fairly new. rom 1789 until 1913, Senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented; following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, they are now popularly elected. ",Surprised
26,That is a very interesting fact.  Do you remember the first time you voted?,Curious to dive deeper
26,I don't. it was a long time ago! Women were not allowed to wear pants on the u.s. senate floor until 1993.,Surprised
26,I think that is the strangest fact of the day.  I think it's wild when observers have to be blocked from polls during elections.,Curious to dive deeper
26,Strange and freaky! dian government sets up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for a single voter.,Surprised
26,I think I've read that before! Wild to think about.,Curious to dive deeper
26,Nice chatting with you. Thanks!,Curious to dive deeper
27," Hey how are you, can't believe that Georgia senator got arrested!",Curious to dive deeper
27,She said she was peacefully chanting.,Sad
27," That's interesting, I wish voting was different now, no reason to still have ballots with no federal holiday for Election Day.",Curious to dive deeper
27,It's interesting that astronauts vote from space!,Surprised
27," For sure, I wonder if it's confidential up there? How does it get back to earth?",Curious to dive deeper
27," Right, I'll have to look that up. Indian government sets up a polling booth in a  forest that is full of lions for just one voter.",Surprised
27," I wonder if that person even shows up to vote, or why he's in the jungle like that haha. Did you vote last election?",Curious to dive deeper
27," Yes I did. And even though we don't have to go to a forest full of lions, voter turnout for US presidential elections has not reached 62.8 percent in the last 100 years.",Surprised
27," That's crazy, I wonder if they'll ever fix that, plenty of things they can do about that but never attempt it. ",Curious to dive deeper
27,Since 1900 the taller candidate has won the US presidential election. Hope that's just a coincidence!,Surprised
27," Oh wow, that's pretty crazy. I'm 6'4"", I should run for president lol. ",Curious to dive deeper
27," Ha, maybe you should. Officials in Athens didn't have much faith in elections. They thought it would lead to oligarchy.",Surprised
27," Oh wow, that's some forward thinking. What is an oligarchy again?",Curious to dive deeper
27,It is where power is concentrated in a small group of people.,Surprised
27," Ah I gotcha, they're kind of right I'm sure. I wonder what the perfect government system is? Any ideas?",Curious to dive deeper
27," Not sure I have faith in any, as all great civilizations come to an end. It seems like we are still barely progressing though. Women could not wear pants in the US senate floor until 1993 after a couple of women senators protested by wearing pantsuits.",Surprised
27," Oh wow, that's crazy how sexist they still were. I agree about the great civilizations coming to an end, they all thought they'd be around forever too.",Curious to dive deeper
27," I think it's interesting that astronauts vote from space. Yet, we have low turnouts for presidential elections for those of us on earth, haha.",Surprised
27," For sure, I wonder why people don't show up so much, I wish they would more!",Curious to dive deeper
27," Yeah, the Indian government set up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for one voter, that is pretty neat.",Surprised
27," Very cool. Great chatting with you, I'm going to take off though, take care!",Curious to dive deeper
28,did you watch the movie Frozen?,Curious to dive deeper
28," I did and loved it so much, and you?",Curious to dive deeper
28,me too. Did you know it is the first movie by disney directed by a woman?,Curious to dive deeper
28," Yes and also that it made $1 billion worklwide, that is amazing",Curious to dive deeper
28,I know. Elsa was the main villain in the original script of the movie,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yes but the let it go song was too uplifting to keep her as the villain,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yes. And the original title of the movie was the Snow Queen,Curious to dive deeper
28," Yes but they changed it because feminine titles do not seem to do well, so sad",Curious to dive deeper
28,That is sad and it is just the mentality that we have to work hard to change,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yup agreed. They also changed Rapunzel to Tangled for that same reason,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yeah. DO you have a pet?,Curious to dive deeper
28,I have two cats and a dog. DO you like dogs?,Curious to dive deeper
28,I love dogs. did you there they can have one of the 12 blood types?,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yes and there are blood drives for dogs,Curious to dive deeper
28,So cool. In istanbul they have installed water and food dispensers for dogs,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yes and all you have to do is feed it plastic bottles,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yes such a genius idea and it helps everyone involved,Curious to dive deeper
28,I know. Dogs are really good at understanding pointing,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yes and same goes for the elephants as well,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yeah. Google is a dog company it seems,Curious to dive deeper
28," Yes they have that in their code of conduct, talk about dedication",Curious to dive deeper
28," I know right, dogs deserve that though",Curious to dive deeper
29,Do you like baseball ?,Curious to dive deeper
29,I have heard of it. Do you?,Neutral
29," I like, the sport but there is not MLB team in my city, so I don't watch it. But I find it really interesting, full of small details, like managers wear a uniform so they could replace a player if they need to. ",Surprised
29," That is probably a holdover from the old days when a player was chosen to be manager. Nowadays, it wouldn't work.",Neutral
29," Yes, I wonder if it could be even dangerous for some of them, like some could have an heart attack.  ",Neutral
29," Yeah, no insurance company would touch the managers on the field, that's for sure.",Neutral
29," I think they would be better at softball, did you ever watch a softball game ? ",Curious to dive deeper
29," I have never watched a softball game, though I understand many women play it. ",Neutral
29," I think it is more a hobby than a professional sport, the average salary is around 5500 $ per year, some hobos make more. ",Neutral
29," Hobos? I never thought of income in terms of hobos, though I guess they do make money through their illicit means. ",Neutral
29," Panhandling can be quite profitable, for someone with no income. Like in a busy place as Manhattan. But even if I don't consider softball as a legitimate pro sport, if was the first event televised on ESPN.   ",Neutral
29,Can you win money through betting though? That always legitimizes a sport.,Neutral
29," Yes, if it is your criteria, then video game is a legitimate sport. They have leagues and a lot of betting is done on matches. ",Neutral
29," Their is a physicality to what they do, but it's just in the hands.",Neutral
29," As shooting, and it is even an Olympic sport, but it is strange to see a smoking fat man winning a medal. Do you play video games ?",Curious to dive deeper
29,I used to play video games. Not much now. Lost interest. Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
29," Me too, I have lost interest playing before I have lost interest in buy them so I have a backlog of a few games that reminds me  not to buy the next console. It is the more and more popular, 3 billon hours are played on video games each week on Earth. ",Sad
29,Wow. So much time on games. I guess it's about the same as time spent watching TV.,Neutral
29," Yes, but video are viewed more negatively than TV, that is why you have legislation in some countries limiting the time played by children.",Neutral
29,It is important to keep the kids from losing themselves in the games. Which countries restrict video games?,Curious to dive deeper
29," There is Korea limiting kids under 16, and China I think. Mostly Asian countries. ",Neutral
29," The kids there go nuts over games. I know that there are pro gamers in Korea. Anyway, fun chat!",Happy
29," You too, have a good evening.",Neutral
30,Hi there are you a baseball fan?,Curious to dive deeper
30,i like baseball. i usually watch the world series. You?,Neutral
30,I'm a fan.  Did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if needed.,Happy
30,I think that is a holdover from the old days. i bet back then a player was chosen to also be manager.,Neutral
30,I'm not sure how that worked.  The last one to do that I remember was Pete Rose back in the late 80's.  He played every day and managed at the same time.,Happy
30," yeah, he was a competitive guy. probably perfect for the dual role of manager/player.",Neutral
30,Up until 2005 a married couple scheduled all 2430 major league baseball games played each year for 24 years!  I bet that could get confusing.,Happy
30," Yeah, i figured that was all done by computer.  I guess they had a pretty sweet gig.",Neutral
30,Must have paid pretty good otherwise I don't think they would have done it for that long.  A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in grandfathers attic that were hidden since the 1940's.  He hit the jackpot.,Happy
30," Wow. I would probably sell some, and keep the rest as an investment. What would you do?",Neutral
30,I would do exactly the same as you.  How could you not pass that up the chance to set yourself up for life? lol,Happy
30," Yeah, that is quite lucky. Do you follow softball at all?",Neutral
30,I actually enjoy watching college softball on ESPNU!,Happy
30,Really? the womens game? do men play as well?,Neutral
30," lol I watch the women though because the pitchers really sling that ball to the plate.  On May 11, 1991 Creighton hosted Utah in the longest softball game in NCAA history lasting 31 innings!",Happy
30," Yeah, that underhand pitch can really move. That is one long game! Not much of a career after college though. As of 2014, the average salary for a professional softball player is between $5,000 and $6,000.",Neutral
30,No.  Not enough fans to support it. lol  Jose Canseco claims to hold the record for longest softball homerun at 622 feet.  He might have it.  I've watched him hitting softballs on youtube.  He crushes them even still to this day.,Happy
30,He had the juice to hit the balls a country mile. I didnt know he played softball.,Neutral
30,Check it out on youtube.  I was shocked at how far the balls go. lol  Kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada! lol It's been fun chatting!,Happy
30," Yes, it has been fun chatting! Have a good weekend!",Neutral
30,You have a great weekend too!,Happy
31," Hi, how are you doing this fine evening?",Neutral
31,Hey there I'm doing great. What did you think about the Disney movie Frozen?,Curious to dive deeper
31," I haven't seen it. Is it a good film? It's animated, right? With lots of songs?",Curious to dive deeper
31," Yes it uses computer animation and it has love songs. It was super popular. There's a song that all the little kids were saying called""Let It Go and I guess it's based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale called the snow queen",Curious to dive deeper
31,HC wrote so many great stories. I read the Snow Queen a long time ago. I don't remember it.Has the movie won any awards?,Curious to dive deeper
31," I'm pretty sure that it has, I know that it made a ton of money. Apparently the villain used to sing that song I mentioned, Let It Go, but the song was so happy that they changed the character",Surprised
31,that's good thinkg. I bet the song is up for an award somewhere. Who were the people involved in the film?,Neutral
31," There's like a princess, a reindeer and a snowman, they're like them three most important characters. Also this is the first movie that was produced by Walt Disney and directed by a woman.",Surprised
31,Not many films get directed by woman. That's good that she got the job. Good for Disney! They know how to spot talent.,Neutral
31,I think so. Apparently she was the first female director of a film that earned over 1 billion dollars too. So that is another record that she set,Surprised
31," Disney has won a ton of awards, and I'm sure she'll win awards as well.",Neutral
31,Oh I'm Sure. Do you like dogs by the way? We used to have a husky ourselves,Curious to dive deeper
31," A dog is a great friend, but no, I have never had a dog. I enjoy playing with them though.",Neutral
31," Dogs are awesome, I think anyway, they have like 12 different blood types and apparently there are dog blood drives that exist",Curious to dive deeper
31,I wonder how the dogs are rewarded at the drive. People get cookies and orange juice.,Neutral
31,I know right? I hope that the dogs get a treat at least haha. Did you know that Istanbul has vending machines that reward stray dogs for bringing back trash?,Surprised
31,The Turks know the value of recycling and that dogs are keen to help for reward.,Neutral
31,Oh for sure! One other thing I didn't know is that dogs and elephants are the only animals that respond to pointing. I want a pet elephant haha!,Happy
31,Good luck with that elephant! Anyway I enjoyed chatting with you!,Neutral
31,I enjoyed chatting with you as well! And yes I'll go to local pet store and see if they have elephants in stock haha,Happy
31,Have a good night,Neutral
31," Thanks you too! And watch out for dogs, they're not actually colorblind but they just don't see as many colors as a normal human can",Surprised
32," Ana Gloria Henrequez was from Salvador, trying to get to USA, trying to escape from misery and gangs in El Salvador. She was caught.",Sad
32," Yeah, I heard about that. I feel horrible for her young daughter",Sad
32," Sorry, Ana Gloria Henrequez is the grandmother, my bad. Ximena is the girl and the mother is Cindy. They said that they never had been caught until Trump's laws.",Sad
32," Yeah, I'm not sure if that actually made any difference. It just really sucks that even after his executive order ending the separation reuniting families is still so difficult",Sad
32," Yes, I know. I don't know how they are not keeping track of what child belongs to what mother. It's terrible to know that the kids were heard wailing and asking for their family members.",Sad
32," It's even crazier that the grandmother could recognize Ximena's voice. I guess since I've never been a parent, I can't comprehend that",Sad
32,You are right. Nobody knows how a parent feels until you are one. Is terrible. I myself I was thinking that I would prefer stay in my country and don't enter the USA at least while they are taking these measures. It would be terrible to lose my son or grandkid.,Sad
32,I understand that. I can also understand wanting to leave when there are gang members on every corner and your little one is just starting school,Happy
32," Yes, I understand that. It has to be very, very difficult, a terrible decision to make. But, me, personally, I would prefer to face it together than not know what happened to them. I don't know, this is a very difficult situation.",Sad
32," Plus, she had to leave her dog behind :( Poor little Cookie",Sad
32," Yes, this is such a terrible story. Well, Cindy was robbed twice on the bus. That makes it very difficult to live in a place where you don't have any safety.",Sad
32,I watched an episode of a TV show Shameless recently and it showed an immigrant child separated from his parents in Texas who ended up in foster care in Chicago!,Surprised
32,I wonder why people are adopting them. Praying for them. Have you seen Frozen?,Sad
32,Many are adopting the kids because they want to give them safe homes!,Surprised
32," Oh, then, thank you very much. Glad to know about this. God bless them. Well, I liked a lot Frozen. Is a fiery Princess.",Happy
32," yes, it was great movie. And there's a sequel coming out. I can't wait!",Happy
32," Hahaha, liked the graphics, tooo!  Do you like dogs? I didn't know that among dogs they have 12 different blood types!!!!!!!",Surprised
32," Yes, and they even have doggy blood drives ^_^ Did the male love interest have a dog or a horse in Frozen? I can't remember...",Curious to dive deeper
32," Really, me either. I have a bad memory for some things. lol, but I think I will never forget that Minnie Mouse's name is really Minerva.",Surprised
32," Really?! Like the Greek goddess? That's fascinating to me. Usually Disney tries to ""de-feminize"" things rather than feminize them more. Frozen was supposed to be named Snow Queen but boys often don't see movies that have feminine nouns in the title :/",Neutral
32," hahahaah that is so much male, lol. Nice to meet you, giving to you an excellent, have a nice day!",Happy
32,Have a lovely day as well :),Neutral
33," Hello my Friend?! Are you a fan of ""Frozen"" the movie? I personally Looooved it!",Curious to dive deeper
33,I have not seen the movie. Is it animated? Is it for kids?,Neutral
33," both! lol, although Im not a kid so I guess for all haha, I did take my kids to see the movie though. It came out in 2013 and earned over 1 billion dollars",Curious to dive deeper
33," That's great! I must be a wonderful film. It's a disney film, yes? Lots of songs?",Neutral
33," That is correct! produced by Walt Disney Animated Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was so cute! They also remade Rapunzel as Tangled, have you seen that?",Curious to dive deeper
33,I have not. I guess the story is basically the same as the fairy tale? Girl with long hair in a tower?,Neutral
33," Yes, another of my favorites! How about you? What do you like to watch?",Curious to dive deeper
33," I enjoy watching comedies and dramas. I sometimes watch animated stuff, but not usually.",Neutral
33," Me too, Mysteries or psychological thrillers are great, but animated is one of my favs to watch with kiddos although everyone knows Minnie mouse did you know minnie is short for minerva?! mind blown",Curious to dive deeper
33," I did not know that. I'm not surprised that Disney makes about $1,110 per second. That's a lot, but reflects the success of the brand.",Neutral
33,Oh my! thats awesome! I guess im not too surprised since the company was founded in 1923!,Curious to dive deeper
33,Almost 100 years old. The Mouse House will soon have a century behind it.,Neutral
33," Wow, well its maintained its popularity very well! I mean there is a whole subculture dedicated to finding hidden mickey mouse images in all things disney",Curious to dive deeper
33," I've never looked for the hidden images, but I imagine they are there! It's part of the playful nature of the company. It wants to create many layers of fun for the viewers.",Neutral
33," Yes, and thus I'm not surprised they're so succesful. That's very creative and engaging, and keeps viewers interested and coming back... genius!",Curious to dive deeper
33,It's ironic that Walt Disney was fired from his job at a local newspaper in Missouri for ''not being creative enough.'' I guess his genius was not recognized because he was ahead of his time.,Neutral
33," Wow! well see, that's why I believe in perfect timing sometimes there are better opportunities ahead of us. amazing! ",Curious to dive deeper
33,Are you interested in dogs? They are quite clever. Dogs can learn over a thousand words and  reason better than chimps.,Neutral
33,Yes! I sometimes Love them better than people... they are just full of Love. Did you know there are 12 different blood types that a dog may have and dog can donate blood at dog blood drives! I love them even more!,Curious to dive deeper
33,That's great! They also have 'eureka moments' and enjoy the experience of solving a problem  to obtain a reward. Much like people!,Neutral
33," Yes and they understand by pointing! How cool is that? Thats how I get my dog to get my slippers! Anyway, fun chatting with you! Namaste :)",Curious to dive deeper
33,Have a good evening!,Neutral
33,you too,Curious to dive deeper
34," I have never heard of Fanfest,",Happy
34,Hey! What is FanFest? lol,Curious to dive deeper
34," I guess its where the hall of famers meet, At first I thought it said hall of farmers, lol",Happy
34,Ok. I honestly never heard of. Do you play video games?,Neutral
34," No, But I did not know they were first designed for the military",Surprised
34,It could be for training purpose. I'm wondering why Australia has more banned games than China... It means some US games also banned... It's quite strange.,Surprised
34,it is like kids in korea being banned playing games after 12,Surprised
34," after or before 12? If after 12, why is it so? I used to play a lot when I was child. I'm not surprised that video games make more money abbually than all films from Hollywood.",Curious to dive deeper
34,But would you categorize them as an art form?,Happy
34,Interesting question. I don't think this is any sort of art. It could be kind of sport. I more support this point of view. How about you? What's your opinion?,Curious to dive deeper
34," I really not did get into them, But I would consider them an art form",Curious to dive deeper
34," It could be. At the same time it would be easy to define popularity of such art. For example, it could be a reason why the rating system was involved in video games.",Neutral
34," Maybe I will just go to the fanfest and try the Pitching tunnels, can you throw well",Curious to dive deeper
34,Ok. Do you watch or play any sport? Like softball or baseball?,Neutral
34," I only play have you heard of any of these players like, Davey Johnson?",Curious to dive deeper
34," Yes. He played in 1970s, right? Or maybe 1960s... I don't remember.",Curious to dive deeper
34," I have no clue, But I love the name Rollie Fingers.",Happy
34," Baseball is fun to watch. I like it. However, I always have difficulties to hit a ball hahaha ",Neutral
34,maybe you should go to the show you can get a medal Maybe,Surprised
34,Medal would be too much significant achievement. The Chicago Cubs were the first to win back-to-back world series and haven't won since. My luck is about the same lol,Neutral
34,Thank you for your time but I must go now,Surprised
34,Have a good day! Thanks.,Neutral
34,bye,Surprised
34,bye!,Neutral
35,Hey how are you? Did you see the FanFest in Miami last year by chance?,Curious to dive deeper
35," No I didn't see that. It's interesting that 23 former Nationals attended it though, did you see it?",Curious to dive deeper
35," Yah, it was pretty cool. I didn't catch who the olympic gold medalists were, did you? They said there were two of them there.",Surprised
35," No I didn't catch their names. But I know that a lot of gold medalist attended as well as some people from the US Olympic softball team, I don't watch sports or the Olympics so I can't say that I know any of the names LOL",Neutral
35," Me neither, I wish I knew more about the olympians, they're so elite. Hard for them to get a lot of recognition though. You play video games by chance?",Curious to dive deeper
35," Yes I play video games somewhat, used to play Maurice a kid but I don't play that many these days. What about you? I'm just glad that I didn't grow up in South Korea because apparently playing a video game after midnight if your under 16 is illegal",Surprised
35," Oh wow, I would have never of guessed that. I played a lot of video games growing up, I think there is a lot of benefit to them. I play Fortnite now, and I'm in my 30s lol. Do you still play?",Curious to dive deeper
35,LOL I have heard of the game but I have never played it. I do know that they did a study and apparently as a planet we play about 3 billion hours of video games a week so I definitely should be playing more perhaps haha,Surprised
35," I could definitely see that. What were your favorite video games? Jane McGongiai was the game designer behind that study, pretty cool.",Curious to dive deeper
35," Well I really liked the Nintendo 64 and I also like the original Xbox, it's interesting that I played a Toy Story game back in the day and it wasn't actually Tom Hanks who did the voice but his brother Jim Hanks",Surprised
35," Wow, I'm surprised they have such similar voices. I went the Sega to Playstation route, still rocking the PS4, no Toy Story game though.",Curious to dive deeper
35,Yeah the PlayStation 4 is cool. I'm just glad that we called him video games and not their original name which was the cathode ray tube Amusement device LOL,Happy
35," I like video game a lot more than Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Devices lol, dang military always overcomplicating things.",Curious to dive deeper
35," I agree with you. Did you ever play the video game LittleBigPlanet or Harry Potter? Apparently the same person did the narration in both of those video games, his name is Stephen Fry",Surprised
35,Stephen Fry from Top Gear?,Curious to dive deeper
35," I'm not sure if it's the same guy, I don't know Top Gear personally, but it could be, do you ever play softball by the way or watch it on TV?",Curious to dive deeper
35," I hear Stephen Fry's name all the time, he must be super famous in the UK. I don't, you going to spit some softball knowledge my way?",Curious to dive deeper
35," Haha yes I can do that. It's interesting that the softball is bigger than a baseball because it is about 12 in in circumference, I've never played softball but that seems like a really big ball lol",Surprised
35," Yah, it's quite a bit larger than a baseball for sure, I've never seen a softball video game though, have you?",Curious to dive deeper
35," No I've never seen one actually. It's interesting though that the average salary for a professional softball player is at most $6,000 LOL definitely you're not retiring on that money",Surprised
35," Oh wow, definitely not! Anyways, I am going to get going, great chatting with you, take care and have a great night!",Curious to dive deeper
35," Yes it's been an excellent chat! And make sure to try out a baseball video game once in awhile, they are actually pretty fun",Happy
36," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
36,Good! You?  Are you into Fiction at all?,Neutral
36,A little and I prefer non-fiction. Do you like it?,Curious to dive deeper
36," I read mainly non fiction too,  but I can get in to some of it. I think it is cool that there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers.",Curious to dive deeper
36," I find that useful too! Edgar allen poe wrote about a cyborg, the oldest example of it.",Surprised
36," Wow, that is kind of neat.  I thought that was a more modern invention.",Neutral
36,Me too. Julius Ceasar wrote fan fiction too!,Surprised
36,Wow.  Id like to see what came out of his mind!,Neutral
36,I guess it was about Hercules and Oedipus. George RR MArtin would not have liked that!,Fearful
36," Yeah, he things it is copyright infringement.  I dont exactly agree with that.",Neutral
36,I don't either. Imagine being the racist judge who tried to ban a comic book because of a black guy in it.,Surprised
36,That is really kind of ridiculous.  I cant even believe that happens.,Neutral
36,I know. I cannot believe people want to upload their minds to computers!,Surprised
36,That is odd.  I dont want my innermost thoughts to be displayed anywhere.,Neutral
36,There's a reason I buried my skeletons deep! I wonder if it runs on water like the Russians did in 1936?,Curious to dive deeper
36," Yeah, that is pretty fascinating.  I wonder why we arent exploring that technology more.",Curious to dive deeper
36,They were too busy building a 16-bit computer using minecraft blocks!,Curious to dive deeper
36,I cant believe that was even possible.  I thought minecraft was just a game.  That is crazy,Neutral
36,Right? I wonder who built it too? I wish my son could do that stuff. But not smoking. Smoking near an apple computer voids the warranty.,Surprised
36," Good thing I never smoked near mine.  They think it makes it a ""biohazard""",Neutral
36,Agreed! Nice chatting with you!,Happy
37," hey there, do you go out and vote during elections?",Curious to dive deeper
37," Hello there, I do like to get out and vote, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
37,me too. do you know way back then though how people were appointed in ancient athens?,Surprised
37,I guess they were appointed by a lottery of some type.  I think they believed that elections would lead to an oligarchy.,Curious to dive deeper
37,I wonder how that would work today though.,Curious to dive deeper
37," Yeah I don't think that would work very well, but then again, maybe it would work better, who knows. ",Curious to dive deeper
37,yeah there is no knowing there. In Nevada they have a none of these candidate options in the ballot.,Surprised
37,Yeah I heard that there were some wild results in the Nevada elections this year.,Curious to dive deeper
37,I did not know about that one. not a lot of people seems to vote though since less than 63 people go out and vote,Surprised
37," Isn't that pretty sad, I guess it hasn't breached that 63% barrier in the last 100 years!",Curious to dive deeper
37,yes it is because it is a right and we are not using it to its best.,Surprised
37,That is true.  Did you know that the taller candidate has won the presidential election 75% of the time?,Curious to dive deeper
37,hahaa I really wonder if that has any correlation with how people perceive the candidates,Surprised
37," Yeah I guess it must, because that is just way too high to just be chance. ",Curious to dive deeper
37,did you hear that international electoral observers were blocked from polls in nine states in 2012,Surprised
37," No I didn't hear that, I wonder why they stopped doing that? ",Curious to dive deeper
37," maybe they did not trust them, i have no idea. do you know when republicans and democrats started using red and blue?",Surprised
37," No I don't, but probably more than 100 years ago or so, do you know?",Curious to dive deeper
37,It was actually as recently as 2000 so not very long ago.,Curious to dive deeper
37," Really, wow I am really bad at politics I guess.  ",Surprised
37,I did not know it either until now. It was nice chatting with you.,Happy
38,Poetry is an art that is getting forgotten,Curious to dive deeper
38," It is one of those that I feel like I don't always understand, but love to hear the analysis of and see how deep it can get.  For instance, there is a poem where if you read it one way it's sad, but read it in reverse and it's actually inspirational!",Surprised
38," Wow, I bet that poem required a lot creativity, wrtting a poem with completely different meanings, oposing genres, genius",Curious to dive deeper
38," There is one guy that wrote a poem of over 220 words in palindrome (where it is the same backwards and forwards -- like ""nurses run"")!",Surprised
38," Sounds really hard, did you ever read one of Edgar Allan Poe's poems?",Curious to dive deeper
38," I think I read a couple.  I feel like I know them so well because of horror and Halloween stories.  I know ""The Raven"" was pretty popular.  Do you think he made a lot of money with that poem?",Curious to dive deeper
38," Not really in fact he only made $9 for the publication of that poem, seems really underpaid",Curious to dive deeper
38,Wow!  That is crazy!  I hope he had a good day job.  Maybe just regular fiction works would have been better financially.,Surprised
38," I hope he did as well, the raven is like his most popular poem and selling it for $9, business was slow, he also wrote cyborg fiction,",Curious to dive deeper
38,That's pretty cool.  If he'd had a black character in it in the 1950s that was worthy of banning a science fiction comic!,Disgusted
38," That sounds really racist, theres a wiki rank of fictional characters according to power and abilities,  I wonder who is the strongest hero",Curious to dive deeper
38," Maybe like a Superman type or Hercules?  Funny thing, future emperor Julius Caesar actually wrote Hercules based fan fiction when he was younger.  I wonder what that was like.",Surprised
38," I bet it was pretty good, it was about Hercules and Oedipus, I wonder if he was good.",Curious to dive deeper
38," Game of Thrones author, George RR Martin, might not have cared for it.  Maybe Caesar would get a pass, but Martin doesn't care for fan fiction at all!",Neutral
38," Yeah I heard he hated fan fiction, he doesnt care about it at all so changing the subject a bit do you use computers a lot?",Curious to dive deeper
38," It seems like that is what I do the vast majority of my day.  I'm not ready to upload my mind to a computer or memory stick like transhumanists, but it is like an extension of me some days.",Fearful
38," I agree theres so much we dont understand about the human mind, Transhumanist must be missing key elements of the human essence.",Curious to dive deeper
38," Are you a PC or a Mac?  Be warned that being a smoker an an apple computer user could actually void the warranty as they see it as a biohazard if someone smokes by it.  I am neither, but that's beside the point.",Neutral
38," I have a mac and I dont smoke but its good  to know, seems kind of random to void a warranty because of that, ",Curious to dive deeper
38," Maybe they should have tried to make a water-based computer, which apparently the Russians were able to make in 1936.  I do wonder what sort of ""computer"" that was though.",Neutral
38," I wonder if they still make computers that ran on water, not sure is the best idea to mix water with tech",Curious to dive deeper
39,Do you like to use computers?,Curious to dive deeper
39,Yes I love computers. I can't imagine my life without one. In 1936 the Russians made one that ran on water.,Curious to dive deeper
39," Interesting. If you think about it, a lot of power comes from water. ",Curious to dive deeper
39,Yes such as hydropower. Apple computer's seem to be quite sensitive because if you smoke near an Apple Computer it voids the warranty.,Curious to dive deeper
39," Interesting. That doesn't sound true, but I wonder if it is the same for the iphone?",Curious to dive deeper
39,I don't know what you mean? There is a group called transhumanist's that want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks!,Curious to dive deeper
39," That sounds pretty cool. I would do it, would you? ",Curious to dive deeper
39,I don't know sounds kind of creepy to me! Almost like the work of fiction! Like something from someones imagination!,Curious to dive deeper
39,I think it would be pretty cool. Do you play minecraft?,Curious to dive deeper
39,I have in the past. Kind of amazing someone built a working computer using only the mine craft building blocks.,Surprised
39," Yeah, that is pretty crazy. I'm not even sure how that is possible? ",Curious to dive deeper
39,Me neither. I also don't know how the space shuttles general-purpose computer runs on 1 Mb of RAM.,Curious to dive deeper
39,I'm not sure either. It seems like a small amount of ram.,Curious to dive deeper
39,Yes it does. Do you like reading fiction? I kind of like reading things that are not based on history or facts.,Curious to dive deeper
39,I'm not a huge fan of fiction. Did you know there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters based on powers?,Curious to dive deeper
39,I would like to see that. Edgar Allan Poe wrote the oldest known example of cyborgs in fiction.,Curious to dive deeper
39,That would be pretty cool. I wonder what the best fictional character is on the wiki?,Curious to dive deeper
39,Yes I bet superman is up there. Probably Thor too. Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Hercules in his youth. He definitely got started early.,Curious to dive deeper
39,Superman definitely has to be up there if not number one. Well nice chatting with you!,Curious to dive deeper
39,A judge in the 1950s tried to ban a work of science fiction because it featured a black character. Glad times have changed. Nice talking to you too!,Curious to dive deeper
39,Nice chatting with you too!,Happy
40,Hi and good afternoon. Are you a poetry fan? It has a long history dating back to prehistoric times.,Curious to dive deeper
40," Hi, how are you? i am not a big fan of poetry. Are you?",Neutral
40,I think it's fun to read sometimes. The origins are more interesting for me. Early poems in the Eurasian content evolved from folksongs.,Curious to dive deeper
40,I dont much about poetry. that is interesting. i guess poetry and songs would be closely related.,Neutral
40," Yes I suppose they would. They tried to define poetry in ancient Greece such as Aristotle's poetics. It focused on the use of speech in rhetoric, drama, song, and comedy.",Curious to dive deeper
40," I guess poetry is spoken and written, so it is related to many arts. Do you have a favorite poet?",Neutral
40,I think it's funny when comedians do poetry. I don't really have a favorite poet. Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome!,Neutral
40," that must have taken him quite a while. 224 words, backwards and forwards? my head hurts.",Neutral
40,Yes mine hurts just thinking about it. Edgar Allan Poe is another classic poet and he only received $9 for the publication of his poem the Raven.,Curious to dive deeper
40," He probably spent it on drugs and booze too. the man was so decadent, but maybe it inspired him.",Neutral
40,Yeah you probably did. I love the hobbit too. Most of the character names were taken out of an old Icelandic poem called dvergatal.,Curious to dive deeper
40," Yes, Tolkien loved old languages. he studied them and learned to speak some of them. ",Neutral
40," That is so fascinating, I love his works of fiction. I like fiction because it is so imaginative. What is your favorite genre?",Happy
40,I like non fiction because i want to keep up with what is going on in the world.,Neutral
40,That's good and definitely practical. The author of game of thrones despises fan fiction because he says it is copyright infringement and not a good exercise for aspiring writers. I kind of see where he's coming from.,Curious to dive deeper
40," the fans should try to write their own stories, not rehash someone else's. ",Neutral
40,Exactly. I think it's so funny authors used have to write on old typewriters. Now they have computers which can basically carry out any sequence of arithmetic or logical operations.,Surprised
40," Yes, the typewriter changes the relationship between the writer and the prose. i figure that the computer makes my writing different.",Neutral
40,Yes probably mine as well now that you mention it. If you have an Apple computer make sure you don't smoke near it because it voids the warranty. Very nice talking with you this afternoon.,Neutral
40," What about vaping? is vaping ok? LOL Yes, i enjoyed chatting!",Neutral
40,Ha ha that is very important information I need to know too! Have a good afternoon.,Curious to dive deeper
41," Hello there, do you use Amazon?",Curious to dive deeper
41," Yes, I like Amazon, I like their movie site and their purchase website.",Curious to dive deeper
41," Yeah I use their delivery service quite a bit, especially around Christmas. ",Curious to dive deeper
41," Amazon is a super large company, did you know chief executive own the Washington Post?",Curious to dive deeper
41,No I didn't know that.  Do you know how much the first ever Amazon purchase was for?,Curious to dive deeper
41," No I don't know, do you have any idea, if yes how much was the first purchase?",Curious to dive deeper
41,Yeah it was for $27.95 and it was for the rights to name a building after themselves.,Curious to dive deeper
41," Wow, I will always respect Amazon, because they offer thousandth of people employment rather or not they except it.",Curious to dive deeper
41," Yeah they do, do you know that the US postal service has a contract with Amazon to deliver on Sundays?",Curious to dive deeper
41," No I didn't know that, but I notice they Improve their delivery services to only a few days before receiving their packages.",Curious to dive deeper
41," Yeah they do.  On a different note, do you know much about sharks?",Curious to dive deeper
41," No, I don't, but I know there are different kind of sharks and they behave in different ways. I like seen them on TV, but not in real life.",Curious to dive deeper
41," Yeah I only know a little bit, I do know that because they have no bones on land, a sharks weight would crush its own body. ",Curious to dive deeper
41," most people think that all sharks are killer sharks, but I read that all shark aren't killer sharks. Have you seen the movies about sharks?",Curious to dive deeper
41," No, just tv shows about them.  I think the Greenland shark and 5 gilled sharks are the most interesting.  The Greenland sharks live for a crazy amount of time!",Curious to dive deeper
41," Yes you are right, I didn't know sharks didn't have ribs. I wonder how they upstand attacks from other animals from the waters?",Curious to dive deeper
41,Yeah isn't that interesting.  I guess they also evolved earlier than dinosaurs as well.,Curious to dive deeper
41," every show played on TV, always wonder how dolphins kill sharks? I notice dolphins always attack from the side.",Curious to dive deeper
41,Yeah I think you are right on that.  Dolphins are so interesting to me on how they communicate with each other.,Curious to dive deeper
41,Did you know sharks can be trained to bark like a dog?,Curious to dive deeper
41," Really? That is crazy, I wonder who thought of even trying that.  Well it was good talking with you, I hope you have a good night. ",Happy
42," Hello friend, Do you like horses?",Curious to dive deeper
42,I do. Did you know horses are able to sleep standing up and lying down?,Curious to dive deeper
42," Yes, that is cool. Did you know that the horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large single-toed animal of today? ",Curious to dive deeper
42,That makes it even more impressive that there are over 300 breeds of horses in the world today.,Curious to dive deeper
42," Yes, humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Some species were domesticated but then some are still living in the wild as feral horses.",Curious to dive deeper
42,I just heard that Icelandic horses have a fifth gear. Horses are simply fascinating.,Curious to dive deeper
42," Yes, I agree. There is an extensive specialized vocabulary used to described equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.",Curious to dive deeper
42,What do you think about sharks? Did you know they're sister species to rays?,Neutral
42," Yes, fascinating fact!. And sharks can be trained like dogs to bark.",Curious to dive deeper
42," I kinda feel bad for them. They have no rib cages so if they ever end up on land, they get crushed by the weight of their body.",Curious to dive deeper
42," Yes, sad indeed. Sharks even evolved earlier than dinosaurs and trees.",Curious to dive deeper
42,Have you ever seen the white shark cafe? It's where white sharks meet in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.,Curious to dive deeper
42," No, I've never seen it but I have heard about it.  Did you know that not just dolphins rescue sailors, but sharks too?",Curious to dive deeper
42,I did know that. Animals cease to amaze me. We have to protect them at all costs.,Neutral
42,I agree. Do you do any online shopping on Amazon.com? Amazon sells almost everything from A to Z.,Curious to dive deeper
42,I do. Did you know Amazon started as an online bookstore?,Happy
42," Yes, and then they later diversified to sell video downloads, MP3 downloads, audiobooks downloads, software, video games, electronics, apparel, furniture, food, toys, and jewelry. Wow.",Curious to dive deeper
42,Have you read anything about Amazon's proposed second HQ?,Neutral
42," No, I did know that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years, though.",Curious to dive deeper
42,I did know. I don't really understand a lot of what Jeff Bezos does. That money could've been used better elsewhere.,Curious to dive deeper
42," That could be. Maybe, he makes up for it by keeping his employees healthy.  Amazon warehouse workers walk between 7 and 15 minutes a day as part of their shift.  Nice chatting with you.",Curious to dive deeper
43,Hey! I've been reading a lot lately. Do you read any fiction or poetry?,Curious to dive deeper
43," Hi! Hm. I don't read much fiction or poetry, but I've been exposed to a lot of it in my lifetime. Do you have any favorites? I've tried my hand at creating both, and failed miserably! It's tough! It's an art form, that I just can't do!",Curious to dive deeper
43," I've been more into poetry lately. It's fascinating that it's been around since prehistorical times, with hunting poetry in Africa. ",Neutral
43," Oh it's fascinating, for sure! Even more so to me since it eludes my abilities. heh. I've read that there is a poem which when read forwards is depressing, and when read backwards is inspiring! I'd really like to read it, but I can't find anything more about it, as of yet.",Curious to dive deeper
43," That is fascinating. Similarly, Demetri Martin once wrote a 224 word palindrome poem. ",Neutral
43," Oh wow! Now there is a poem, I forgot that I loved! The Raven, by Edgar Allen Poe. It's been so long since I've heard it! I mean like 20+ years! Something about The Raven rap-tap-tapping on his door, or floor? Haha. I heard he only got $9 for the publication of that poem! Go figure.",Surprised
43," Wow! Just $9?! Somebody got a bargain! Did you know Edgar Allen Poe also wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction? Pretty diverse author, isn't he?",Curious to dive deeper
43," Oh yeah? What an interesting person he must have been, in general! I don't even know what Javanese is , but apparently their alphabet when recited in order, is a poem. The ABC's are pretty poetic to me, now that we recite them so sing-songy.",Surprised
43," I wonder what kind of poems a computer could come up with? Computers do everything else, they can control microwave ovens, remote controls, robots...why not write poetry, right?",Curious to dive deeper
43," Haha! I'm slightly certain that soon, they will write poetry. Computers have come such a long way! I found something really interesting, in 1936 the Russians made a computer that ran off of water! I wonder what went wrong with that. Maybe electricity and water wasn't the best idea?",Curious to dive deeper
43," Computers can be fairly delicate, I suppose. Smoking near apply computers voids the warranty by making it ""a biohazard"". What in the world could that mean?",Neutral
43," Hm.. Yeah I know that smoking near them, just really clogs everything up, kind of taking dust and mixing it with the tarry nicotine and it creates a huge mess and can break a computer and completely stop the fans and such, but bio-hazard? I'm interested to learn why that is. Kinda scary!",Fearful
43,Someone built a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic Minecraft building blocks. I wonder what kind warranty that one has?!,Surprised
43," Haha! Woah! There's a thing called transhumanists I guess, and they want to upload their brains to computers and memory sticks! I don't want to do that! One lifetime is okay by me. I can only imagine the torment of a mind having to just live for possibly forever! Yikes!",Fearful
43," I agree! What if people tried to read my mind's unpublished poetry! No thank you! I have some interesting fan fiction in my head, just like Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Hercules and Oedipus. But that's private!",Happy
43,Haha! I am quite happy keeping my thoughts to myself! It sounds like a scary sci-fi movie to me! My computer brain gets arrested and imprisoned for eternity in 100 years for some crazy new law! No thank you!,Fearful
43," How much memory would it take to store all of us, anyway? Maybe less than I think. A space shuttle can run on 1mb of RAM. ",Neutral
43,That's crazy! Precisely why I'm not an astronaut! I wouldn't want to do crazy things such as trust my life to 1mb of ram!,Surprised
43," Haha! There's a good science fiction  book, The Martian, which has some interestin parts about computers and space shuttles. That author had a pretty good imagination. ",Neutral
43," Woah! In the 50's a judge tried to ban a sci-fi comic because it featured a black character! Thank goodness, we've come a long way from that hatefulness. But still we have a ways to go, before things are truly equal, really for all races.",Surprised
43," Thank goodness, indeed. I agree with you, though, there is still progress to be made, and I think reading diverse fiction and poetry can help people see things from other perspectives. ",Happy
43,Oh absolutely! Really all art forms and most certainly the internet is going to bring humanity together on a much more even playing field. It was really nice talking with you!,Happy
44,Hello! Are you an Amazon Prime member?,Curious to dive deeper
44," Yes, I am and love it!  That two day delivery really comes in handy!!",Happy
44,It really does! Even Sunday delivery rocks especially since Amazon contracted with the USPS.,Happy
44," Yes, I think that was good for the USPS!  How would you like to have a building named after yourself for being a customer and only spend $27.95?",Curious to dive deeper
44,If only I knew about it years ago!!!!! I didn't realize they own IMDB as well!,Surprised
44," I know, I didn't either!  Thinking the amazon warehouse workers don't need a gym membership with walking 7-15 miles each day on a shift! Omg!",Surprised
44,I would be the fittest man alive working there haha. They ought to use horses there! Especially Icelandic horses that can speedwalk!,Surprised
44," Ha, ha, ha, Yes!! Good idea, I love horses, Guess you can't ride your horses to school on, no vehicle day or you can get suspended.",Surprised
44,Oh I know I saw that two high school students did that! I remember kids would drive their tractors to my high school!,Curious to dive deeper
44," Oh really, Wow! Did you know Clint Eastwood is allergic to horses, after riding all those horses in the movies?",Surprised
44,You would have never guessed since he rode like hundreds of them! He should have rode sharks instead!,Surprised
44," Well, I guess sharks have been around a long time. Makes sense they were here before the trees and dinosaurs!!",Neutral
44,Crazy to think that is one long time! I didn't know they could be trained like dogs to bark!,Surprised
44,I didn't know that either. I would like to hear that. I will have to look that up!,Surprised
44,They already sound a lot smarter than me haha. I always wondered why dalmatians were used at firehouses.,Surprised
44," I know, isn't it good they helped calm and protect the  horses back then. Aren't Lipizzaner horses beautiful!!",Curious to dive deeper
44,Yes I think it was! It all makes sense to me now haha. They really are. I don't know many animals or things that can change colors of their skin!,Surprised
44," Yes it only takes about 6 years, and give great classical dressage performances!",Happy
44,I would love to see them in real life! I'm good with sharks though although I just snorkeled with some last month!,Curious to dive deeper
44," Really, very cool! I love to snorkel too! The coral reefs are so spectacular!!",Happy
44,They really are! Well it was nice chatting with you have a good night!,Surprised
45," Hey there, heard anything interesting lately? I sure have, did you know Amazon contributed 38 billion to the city of Seattle's economy just by being there? ",Curious to dive deeper
45," Hi, no I did not know. It looks like amazon means exciting news. They are now looking for a site for a second headquarters!",Curious to dive deeper
45," That's great! Not everyone thinks so though, Amazon can come with difficulties in transportation and shoot up the housing costs of whatever city it's in. ",Fearful
45,They do make an impact wherever they go. I found interesting that there is a building named after the first amazon.com customer,Happy
45," I heard they're considering Washington as a place for their 2nd HQ, wherever they put the building is going to get a huge boost! I heard they're even considering New York!",Curious to dive deeper
45," Also Los angeles, atlanta, and Dallas. they are looking for as much as 8 million sq ft",Happy
45," Don't forget about their original HQ, it was founded by Jeff Bexos on July 5 1994. And it's the largest internet retailer in the world! ",Happy
45," An in the US they are the most valuable company after Apple and Microsoft, they have really grow so much!",Curious to dive deeper
45,It's probably thanks to their hard-workers! I heard they walk 7-15 miles each day as apart of their shift.,Happy
45,that is a lot!,Happy
45," And the CEO Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years! I guess he has the money to do so!",Surprised
45,We can't deny he is full of great ideas. i did not know that IMBD is owned by amazon!!,Happy
45," Me neither! Amazon seems to have a lot of power, they have a contract with the post-office to make sure our packages get delivered even on Sunday!",Surprised
45,that is neat. Did you know they started with being an online bookstore?,Surprised
45," That's incredible, they also have a publishing arm known as Amazon publishing for people who want to publish their eBooks through them!",Curious to dive deeper
45," that is good! Hey, do you like animals?",Happy
45," I love animals, my favorite is the Shark. Did you know they can be trained just like dogs? Talk about man's best friend.",Curious to dive deeper
45," Di you know that they meet in the pacific ocean, in a place named ""white Shark cafe"". I love coffee but I would try not to end up there!",Happy
45," Crazy, but what's even crazier is that Shark's have no rib cages! If they were on land they'd be crushed by the weight of their own body. ",Sad
45," We are all afraid and even terrified of sharks, but it looks like they can rescue sailors!",Happy
45," That's probably because they evolved earlier than Dinosaurs, nature's perfect killer!",Curious to dive deeper
45,Crazy! there a very small ones. there is one called small dwarf lantershark. and it has a lenght of 17 cms. well it was so nice talking to you!!,Happy
46,Good morning.,Neutral
46,good morning,Neutral
46,Do you keep up with the election?,Curious to dive deeper
46," yeah, but moderately.  You?",Neutral
46," yes, about the same. I know there are the republican and democrat party.",Neutral
46,the only election that I follow is the Presidential Election,Neutral
46,Same here. I don't follow local as I do not live in the same state more than 3 years at a time.,Neutral
46,I see. Do you know who has a higher authority than a state's governor?,Curious to dive deeper
46,I think state senator. DId you know there hasn't been a president that wasn't a republican or democrat since 1853,Curious to dive deeper
46,Very interesting.  Was this President an independence in your opinion?,Curious to dive deeper
46,I think so. I dont know if any green party have ever been elected. Did you know all presidents with beards have been republican.?,Curious to dive deeper
46,Just know about this fact by now.  Which party do you think will win the next Presidential Electin?,Curious to dive deeper
46,I think the republicans will win. Do you think someone will run against Trump on the republican ballot next time?,Curious to dive deeper
46," I believe the current Texas's governor, but I do not remember his name",Neutral
46,Ancient Athens did their appointment by lottery instead of election.,Neutral
46," It is weird, but true",Surprised
46," The Beatles song ""come together"" was written for a California governor.",Neutral
46,There somehow was a connection between Beatles band and California politics.,Curious to dive deeper
46,Did you know North Dakotas governor declared martial law in 1934 and seceded from the U.S,Neutral
46," I did not know about this fact.  I am wondering if it is still in effect.  By the way, nice chatting with you",Surprised
46,You too. I do not think its in effect though.,Neutral
47,hi are you a republican?,Curious to dive deeper
47,No I am not. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
47," No I am not, I am a Libertarian. Maybe one of us will win soon, it hasn't happened since 1853.",Curious to dive deeper
47," Well I am just hoping Trump doesn't win a second term next year, but with how corrupt everything is now it is looking like a very likely outcome.",Curious to dive deeper
47," I do too, I don't particularly like him. Did you vote last election",Curious to dive deeper
47," I did, I voted Hillary even though I didn't really care for her either, but she was a much better choice than what we ended up with.",Curious to dive deeper
47," For sure, I voted third party. I was part of the problem, I wanted a 3rd party to win because it has been years!",Curious to dive deeper
47," Well Bernie Sanders just announced his 2020 run, so if he actually makes it onto the ballot this year I will vote for him.",Curious to dive deeper
47," Yea, he got taken out of the running in 2016 by hillary. I am voting BIDEN!",Curious to dive deeper
47," If Biden decided to run in 2020 i would probably choose him over Bernie, I always liked him when he was VP.",Curious to dive deeper
47," For sure, and he would take Trump down.",Curious to dive deeper
47," I am not sure anyone can take Trump down at this point, with all the rumored election rigging and ties to Russia, I personally think he will just cheat to win again and no one will do anything about it, just like these last 4 years.",Sad
47," Right, I figured the same thing! I don't think he's good and if he wins I think we know for sure it was rigged.",Curious to dive deeper
47," Well one problem is the election is based on the electoral college more than actual peoples votes. If we could get rid of the electoral college and get back to the popular vote, like it should be, he wouldn't even have won the first time.",Surprised
47,For sure. They should do it like athens did back in the day. Use a lottery system to prevent oligarchy! I think he is cheating the system,Curious to dive deeper
47," Yep and nothing is being done about it. Bill Clinton cheated on his wife and every one through a fit and started impeachment proceedings, but Trump supposedly gets away with treason and it really grinds my gears.",Curious to dive deeper
47," For sure, and cheating on his wife a bunch of times!",Curious to dive deeper
47," yeah Clinton was not a good husband but he was a pretty darn good president, I will never understand why his personal life mattered to so many people, and then when it looks like we have an actual traitor in the seat no one seems to care.",Curious to dive deeper
47," for sure, people made good money and the economy was great! Good chatting with you!",Surprised
47," Yeah same to you, good chat.",Curious to dive deeper
47,bye!,Curious to dive deeper
48," Hello, do you follow politics much?",Curious to dive deeper
48," Hi I do from time to time, it is hard to escape them all together. Did you know every republican president has had a beard? ",Curious to dive deeper
48,Oh pretty cool fact. And since 1853 the president has been either a republican or a democrat,Curious to dive deeper
48," Wow pretty dominant. THey did not start using the colors red and blue until 2000, I thought it was earlier than that",Curious to dive deeper
48," Yeah it does feel late, you are right. Did you hear about Truman and his refusal to take a photo on the dumbo ride?",Curious to dive deeper
48," Yeah he just id not want to be associated with Republicans in any way, shape or form and the dumbo is their logo",Curious to dive deeper
48,Yup pretty much. DO you know how officials were elected in ancient athens?,Curious to dive deeper
48," Yes by lottery, and I wonder how that would work nowadays probably a mess",Curious to dive deeper
48," Hahah agreed. In Nevada you have the options to not vote for any of the candidates, I like that",Curious to dive deeper
48," Me too, I wish it were in all the states. Too bad not a lot of people show up at the polls though",Curious to dive deeper
48,Yeah I hope we can go past that almost 63%. We need to all vote,Curious to dive deeper
48,Yes I agree. Since 1990 it seems the taller candidate has been winning the election. Coincidence?,Curious to dive deeper
48,Hmm interesting one. DO you know what the Beatles song Come together was written for?,Curious to dive deeper
48,Yeah it was for the California governor Timothy Leary in 1969,Curious to dive deeper
48,Yeah that one. When Schwarzenegger was governor of California he did not live in Sacramento and commuted ever day,Curious to dive deeper
48," But he did not have it rough, he travelled by private jet 3 hours each day",Curious to dive deeper
48,Good for him I guess. North Dakota governor declared martial law in 1934,Curious to dive deeper
48,Yes and then seceded from the US. WOw,Curious to dive deeper
48," In Texas, the first female governor was elected before other stated had ratified the amendment",Curious to dive deeper
48," Nice, seems they were a bit more ahead of time/. Ralph Lawrence  Carr was the only governor that did not agree with the internment of japane americans during WWII",Curious to dive deeper
48,Must have been tough being the only guy.,Happy
49,The Republican Party is really popular in the states do you agree?,Curious to dive deeper
49,Unfortunately yes.  It is not like the republican party of old times.,Neutral
49," Yeah a lot of things have changed, funny anecdote with Truman and Dumbo though",Curious to dive deeper
49,That is a good one.  Poor Dumbo.  He probably didnt realize what was happening.  They should have brought out Eeyore instead.,Neutral
49," I know right Dumbo didnt have the fault lol, I bet he isnt a Republican either,",Happy
49,Probably not.  He might wear blue for all we know.,Neutral
49," So the red and blue colors, seem like they have been around forever but its a recent thing from the year 2000",Curious to dive deeper
49,That is surprising!  I feel like they have always been there as far back as I can remember.,Neutral
49," It sure seems like a lot longer, so elections are really important Im just glad we have that choice many countries dont",Curious to dive deeper
49," Very true, which is why it is surprising election turnout hasnt gotten above 63%",Neutral
49," And thats how we end up with leaders like Trump lol, also the taller candidate wins 75% of the time, interesting stat",Curious to dive deeper
49,So we need to find someone taller than him for 2020.  Lets start searching now. lol,Neutral
49," We sure do lol, did you know Nevada is the only state with the option ''None of these''",Curious to dive deeper
49,They have that?  Ok... im kinda jealous now.,Neutral
49," They do, seems like the best option at times lol",Curious to dive deeper
49,It really does.,Neutral
49,I think one of the best governors is Schwarzenegger would be cool to have the terminator as president one day,Curious to dive deeper
49,It really would1,Neutral
49," He is a great actor but also a great politician, he has done a lot for California and is a really popular guy",Curious to dive deeper
49," He really has.  Did you know he commuted by private jet each day, 3 hours!",Neutral
49," Sounds like a really busy guy, anyways its time for lunch, its been great chatting with you but Im taking a break, thanks a lot",Curious to dive deeper
50,What did you think of the last couple elections?,Curious to dive deeper
50,I think it has been great for the country. people have come to realize the power of the vote.,Neutral
50,That is a great point. I want to keep seeing more and more voter turnout. It hasn't been more than 62.8 percent in 100 years,Curious to dive deeper
50,the vote should be mandatory. then people would see the power of the ballot.,Neutral
50," I agree, I am sure other countries do that. I don't think we should go back to how ancient athens did it, do you know how?",Curious to dive deeper
50,i think they used a lottery. that would help avoid power falling into certain hands consistenly.,Neutral
50,yea and hoping the lottery would not allow an oligarchy. I wonder if that worked or not,Curious to dive deeper
50," it probably slowed it down. officials can still bribed, even randomly elected ones.",Neutral
50,Yea you're right. I am sure it was rigged. How do you like Republicans?,Curious to dive deeper
50," well, they can be bribed after the fact once elected. The country has shifted farther right, so they are pretty far right now.",Neutral
50,Yea that is a good point. is your governer part of that far right?,Curious to dive deeper
50," no, i dont think so. i think that the far right is usually in the south. ",Neutral
50," Yea I think so too, our governor is republican but not a far right one. There was only one governor who opposed internment of japanese people in ww2",Curious to dive deeper
50," yeah, during wartime it is hard to stop people from acting on hate. i expect that could happen again soon if there is war with chna.",Neutral
50," for sure, I am sure something big will happen in our lifetime. It is bound to happen. I still can't believe schwarzenegger was governor",Curious to dive deeper
50," he had notoriety to launch a campaign. if you are rich, famous, tall, etc you can run for govt. i figure the future is all about marketing, not content.",Neutral
50,He was the terminator! That is all he needed! lol,Curious to dive deeper
50," yeah, the governator. he was not a good speaker but people knew him. he didnt get much done because he didnt understand politics.",Neutral
50," For sure, I would have voted for him if I was in california, even though he ruined the state. ",Curious to dive deeper
50," people that should run government do not run for office. if they run for office, we probably dont want them in there.",Neutral
50,I agree with you. It was so nice chatting with you!,Curious to dive deeper
51,No. I think it's so interesting that the Republican Party is referred to as the Grand old party.,Curious to dive deeper
51,I agree.  I wonder why they gave themselves that moniker.,Curious to dive deeper
51,Yeah I'm not sure. But every US president with a beard has been Republican.,Surprised
51,True.  I also heard that Hillary Clinton was president of the young republicans when she was in college.,Surprised
51,Oh that's interesting especially given the fact that she just ran Democrat. The red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats only started in 2000.,Surprised
51,That really got me.  I thought they were always around representing the parties.,Neutral
51,Yeah me too but it sounds like they used to use animals more. Truman seem to take that very seriously especially at Disneyland.,Surprised
51,I heard... poor Dumbo.  He probably didnt even understand.,Neutral
51,Ha ha yeah I bet he was so confused. It's funny to think that ride has been around since 1957.,Neutral
51," It really is, it was my favorite as a kid, much to the detriment of my parents.  LOL",Neutral
51,Haha thats funny. Apparently officials in ancient athens were appointed by lottery because they believe elections would lead to oligarchy.,Surprised
51,Well elections also lead to a dog being elected mayor... so I dont know what is worse.,Neutral
51,Haha yes good point. I hope that one day the voter turnout for presidential elections will breach 63%.,Curious to dive deeper
51,Me too.  Did you know the faster blinker has lost every election since 1980.  Who even calculates that data.,Neutral
51,Yeah that is definitely an odd stat.,Surprised
51,There is even a cat that placed 3rd in the Virginia Senate election.  How can animals even run?  That is just crazy,Neutral
51," Haha i guess you can vote for anything. Like blinking, another odd stat is the tallest candidate has won in 75% of elections.",Surprised
51,So we need to look for a slow blinker and a tall person for 2020.,Curious to dive deeper
51," Yeah they will no doubt win! Nevada is actually the only state to have a ""none of these"" candidates voting option.",Surprised
51," That is brilliant, especially if it forces new candidates.",Neutral
51,Yea more states should do it maybe. More states should elect women too. Texas elected their first female governor before some states even ratified the 19th amendment!,Surprised
52,Do you follow politics?,Curious to dive deeper
52,I do. I just learned that the Republican Party was founded by anti-slavery activists. Surprising.,Surprised
52,I never knew that.  There hasn't been a US president who wasn't a Republican or Democrat since 1853.,Happy
52,That's a good thing! Did you know in 1957 President Harry Truman visited Disneyland and refused to be photographed on the Dumbo ride so he wouldn't be associated with the Republican Party?,Surprised
52,That's funny!  Consistent use of the red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats started in 2000.  Could have swore they used those colors before then.,Happy
52," Really? I thought so too! Did you know Nevada is the only state to have a ""none of these candidates"" voting option for Presidential elections?",Curious to dive deeper
52,I didn't know that.  Every US president with a beard has been a Republican.  Interesting.,Happy
52,Huh. I never noticed! Hard to believe voter turnout for US Presidential elections hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years.,Surprised
52,That's an amazing statistic.  Wow.  Since 1900 the taller candidate has won the US presidential election 75 percent of the time.,Happy
52,Oh that is funny! During the 2012 US elections international electoral observers were blocked from the polls in 9 states.,Surprised
52,Interesting.  Do you ever vote for the governor in your state?  I do.,Happy
52," I do. Can you believe when Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor of CA he never lived in Sacramento, instead he commuted 3 hours every day by private jet.",Surprised
52,Didn't know that.  I bet that would get old though flying like that every day.,Curious to dive deeper
52,It is certainly a lot. Did you know the Beatles song Come Together was actually written for Tim Leary's 1969 CA Governor campaign.,Happy
52,I had no idea.  Wonder why a British band at the time would write a song for an American election?  Interesting.,Happy
52,Very! Did you know Ralph Lawrence Carr was the only Governor to oppose the internment of Japanese Americans during WW2?,Surprised
52,I didn't know that.  I've heard about when they did that though to those people.,Happy
52," It's something else, that's for sure.",Neutral
52,In 1934 I see that North Dakota's governor declared martial law and seceded from the US.  I'm learning all kinds of new things today.,Happy
52," Wow! Well, Texas elected their first female Governor, the second in the nation, before some states even ratified the 19th amendment. ",Surprised
52,Looks like Texas was ahead of the times!  Thanks for chatting!,Happy
53,Are you aware that the taller candidate for president has won 75% of the elections of them time.,Curious to dive deeper
53,Hello - it doesn't surprise me. I've even heard that taller people in interviews for jobs tend to get the job more often.,Surprised
53," Crazy, is that true? ",Curious to dive deeper
53," Not sure how true it is, but that's what I've been told. Did you know Hillary Clinton was president of young republicans in college?",Surprised
53,I'm not surprised. Did you know Arnold traveled 3 hours a day to Sacramento when he was the governor?,Curious to dive deeper
53,Wow that's crazy. I can't imagine traveling that far for work.,Surprised
53,Me either. Did you know Tim Leary ran for governor of CA?,Curious to dive deeper
53," I did not know that, but that's interesting. I didn't know congress has played a democrat vs. republican baseball game every year since 1909. ",Curious to dive deeper
53," I did, it must be one boring game! ",Curious to dive deeper
53,Yea I bet it is a very boring game. A cat named Hank placed third in a Virginia senate election once before.,Surprised
53,I can believe it. Did you know Nevada is the only stat that has a none of these candidates as a voting option?,Curious to dive deeper
53,Wow I didn't know that about Nevada.,Curious to dive deeper
53," Yeah, must be an interesting state to live in. Have you ever visited there? ",Curious to dive deeper
53,I have been to Las Vegas twice. What about you?,Neutral
53," Yeah, I've been. But I don't think a majority of the people that visit there vote. ",Curious to dive deeper
53," Yea, I'm not too sure on that. I saw that all elections conducted in Oregon are conducted by mail.",Curious to dive deeper
53," Interesting. It rains a lot in Oregon, have you ever visited? ",Curious to dive deeper
53," Never been to Oregon, but not a state I think I would want to live in with all of the rain they get. ",Neutral
53," Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of rainy states to be honest. ",Curious to dive deeper
53,Me either. Did you know the government of Oklahoma has an Oklahoma shaped pool?,Curious to dive deeper
53," No, weird. Is a hew a professional swimmer? ",Curious to dive deeper
54,Do you watch many movies in the theaters?,Curious to dive deeper
54,Yes I love watching movies! Summer was considered a bad time to release a movie in the theater because of low sales until steven spielberg's jaws.,Surprised
54,Steven spielberg still makes millions from star wars off a bet with george lucas they made in 1977!,Surprised
54," haha thats awesome,  I wonder what the bet was.Steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack. ",Surprised
54,I was wondering the same! After filming the goonies steven spielberg flew the entire cast to hawaii and surprised director richard donner with a cookout.,Surprised
54,Amazing!  Thats so nice. When steven spielberg rode jurassic park the ride on opening day he requested that he was let off before the 84 foot drop,Surprised
54," Too funny! Speaking of entertainers that make a lot of money, With over $8.5 billion worldwide film earnings, tom hanks is the highest all-time box office star.",Surprised
54,He is very talented. Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty was a box office failure.,Surprised
54," Good thing they didn't! Disney's ""treasure planet"" was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time.",Surprised
54," yeah,  I read that recently,  I never saw it.  The movie trojan wars with a budget of $15,000,000 has earned only $309 in box office",Surprised
54,Yikes! The silence of the lambs came out on valentine's day in 1991 and had a box office of over $270 million.,Disgusted
54,That movie was great and creepy at the same time.,Surprised
54,Super creepy. Spielberg became a household name as the director of Jaws.,Surprised
54,Did you know that More than 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed,Neutral
54,That's sad. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water.,Neutral
54," Also, When earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long.  Such short days!  i wouldnt mind going to work for only 2 hours lol ",Surprised
54," That would be great! If earth's entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds.",Surprised
54," Mind blown!  I love these facts! In september of 2010, the united nations appointed official ambassador to extraterrestrials in they case they would ever make contact with earth",Surprised
54,What?! Thats funny. Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.,Surprised
54,The earth is old!  Earth will be virtually helium-free by the end of the 21st century,Neutral
54," Wow. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. ",Surprised
54,was good talking to you!,Surprised
55,Did you ever watch ET?,Curious to dive deeper
55," Yes, I did.  It was the movie when I was a kid!",Happy
55,Seems like Steven Spielberg is trying to return to his glory with Ready Player One. Have you seen that?,Curious to dive deeper
55," No, I haven't see it.  Have you?",Curious to dive deeper
55," I have't either. At the premiere screening the sound cut out. But instead of booing, the audience member cheers and makes their own sound effects.",Curious to dive deeper
55," Well that was sure nice of them to do that, I'm sure Spielberg appreciated it!",Surprised
55," Right, usually that would be embarrassment. That was cool of the audience. Ready Player One is another childlike adventure where virtual reality dominates.",Happy
55," It sounds cool, my grandkids would probably like it.  I remember when I first saw Jaws, it scared me to death!",Fearful
55," Yeah, I know what you mean. Ready Player one takes place on an Earth where people go to VR to escape their real life problems. I can totally imagine this happening in the future.",Curious to dive deeper
55," OMG, goodness, alot of people would def get hooked on that! Do you watch alot of movies?",Curious to dive deeper
55,I don't really though I like Disney movies. How about you?,Surprised
55," Me too, I love Disney movies.  I read that Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after Sleeping Beauty flopped.",Surprised
55,I didn't even know that Sleeping Beauty was a flop! Treasure Planet was also a Disney movie and was the most expensive box office flops of all times.,Surprised
55,I did know that Treasure Planet was a big time flop.  I can't remember anybody that saw it saying they liked it. I read that Tom Hanks is the highest all time box office star.,Happy
55,Would  you see the Silence of the Lambs on Valentine's day? That's the day it came out in 1991. It made over $270 million in box office.,Surprised
55," I remember seeing it, but it wasn't on Valentine's day!",Surprised
55,Trojan Wars on the other hand ws a failure. It had a 15 million budget and earned only $309 in box office.,Surprised
55,That's pitiful!,Surprised
55," Yes that is quite sad. Another sad thing is even though humans are destroying the earth, if earth's history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent one minute and 17 seconds.",Surprised
55," Awesome, I read somewhere that when the Earth was formed a day was only 5 1/2 hours.  ",Surprised
55," Wow, I can't even get enough done in 24 hours!",Surprised
56," Hi Turker, are you familiar with Steven Spielberg? ",Curious to dive deeper
56,Hey. Steven Spielberg is one of the most popular directors. Seen so many of his films.,Neutral
56," Yes you are right, have you seen E.T? if yes, did you like the movie, I know it's an old movie.",Curious to dive deeper
56," Yes it is an old movie. I like older movies. I remember when the game for the atari came out, they literally had to mass dump the product  in a field somewhere.",Neutral
56," Yes I heard about that, but I wonder if the atari could have been recycle, just to think about all those Items were destroyed.",Curious to dive deeper
56,Yeah. its funny that he made all these movies here for all humans to see. Here on planet earth. A 4.5 million year old rock. I wonder if aliens seen our movies?,Curious to dive deeper
56," yes you are right, I really like all the Jurassic Parks, I have watched those movies several times.",Curious to dive deeper
56," Dude!!! Tell me about it. Its crazy that Tom hanks made so much money. Making 8,5 billion worldwide and wasnt in any of the sagas. not in star wars and not in jurassic park.",Curious to dive deeper
56," Yes Tom Hanks made a lot of money also, did you know Steven Spielberg played the clarinet in jaws?",Curious to dive deeper
56," That is so cool how invlolved he is. I read that a movie named trojan wars costed $15,000,000 to make and only made $309. I need to find out what movie that is lol",Curious to dive deeper
56," Wow what a loss, did you know Steven Spielberg still make millions from star wars because a bet from George Lucas in 1977?",Surprised
56,Yes I read that. I did not know that he Directed The Color Purple. Saving private ryan was one of my favorites though.,Neutral
56,Either me I just recently saw color purple and it still a good movie like  I have seen it for the first time.,Curious to dive deeper
56,You see how big Oprah is now right? She was wonderful in that movie.,Happy
56," Yes she was, do you usually purchase your tickets from the box office or purchase online?",Curious to dive deeper
56,I always buy it online. I try to avoid missing out on big titles like star wars. Pick it up at the theatre.,Curious to dive deeper
56,Did you know that more than 80 percent of the earth natural forests already been destroyed?,Curious to dive deeper
56," Yeah I read that. And we continue to use our resources like we dont have a clue whats going on. If global warming hits us, think of the already 71 % water covering earth. It will be catastrophic ",Curious to dive deeper
56," Yes you are right, we can't see it because most of the water is underneath us. ",Curious to dive deeper
56,Oooo imagine the animals in the unexplored water world we have not seen yet. 4.5 million years old and the world has animals in its oceans for quite some time now. Like the lizards.,Curious to dive deeper
56," when the earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long. It was nice chatting with you, have a good night.",Curious to dive deeper
57,Did you know that summer was considered a bad time to release a movie?,Curious to dive deeper
57,In the past it may have been.,Curious to dive deeper
57," Yes, it was until Jaws was released. That was a scary movie back in the day.",Curious to dive deeper
57," Yeah, that was a good movie. Did you like it? ",Curious to dive deeper
57,I use to. I think I have seen it too many times now. Spielberg played the clarinet for the soundtrack.,Curious to dive deeper
57," Yeah, that is pretty interesting. Did you see the Goonies? ",Curious to dive deeper
57,I have. That is a cute movie. I love how they get the jewels at the end to pay the mortgage.,Curious to dive deeper
57,It is pretty good. I'm fairly certain Stranger Things is a rip off of it.,Curious to dive deeper
57,I've never seen that movie. There are so many rip-offs these days.,Curious to dive deeper
57,It is a show on Netflix actually. The first season isn't that bad.,Curious to dive deeper
57," I don't have Netflix. These days, I'm sure that sounds weird.",Neutral
57,I don't either. I saw it at a friends house.,Curious to dive deeper
57,I heard that Netflix is losing a lot of money because of password sharing. Did you know Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star? I would believe it.,Surprised
57," Yeah, that could be, they are creating a lot of their own content. ",Curious to dive deeper
57,All the streaming channels seem to be doing that now.,Neutral
57," Yeah, that is pretty cool. Do you use Roku? ",Curious to dive deeper
57," Yes, I love my ROKU.",Happy
57,Do you recommend getting one of them?,Curious to dive deeper
57," I would definitely. You can also get Netflick, Hulu. I have Amazon Prime which has lots of channels.",Happy
57,Oh cool. Then maybe I will check that out. Are you a Tom Hanks fan?,Curious to dive deeper
57,I truly am. I draw charcoal portraits and I have drawn a picture of him. He is an amazing actor. I also like Robin Williams. I noticed he did a lot of movies about dying.,Neutral
57," I think he is a great actor. Well, nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
57,Nice chatting with you too.,Neutral
58,Do you know much about the Bible?,Curious to dive deeper
58,some yes,Curious to dive deeper
58,Did you know that has sold over an estimated 5 billion copies?  Wow.,Happy
58,I knew it was perhaps the most sold and published book of all time,Curious to dive deeper
58,Yes. Prior to 1963 it was not uncommon for students in the US to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary eduction!,Happy
58,Yes I lived in the Southern US for a while and they still use that at times,Curious to dive deeper
58," Nice.  Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible.  He used a razor to cut out the supernatural parts, such as the miracles and the resurrection.",Happy
58," I was fascinated to hear about that.  That would mean he did not accept the divinity of Jesus Christ, but that He was only a human man.",Surprised
58,Yes!  Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams are the only 2 US presidents that did not use a bible when they were sworn in.,Happy
58,Yes that would indicate to me that they were agnostics or aherents to another form of religion,Curious to dive deeper
58," Yes.  The biblical tower of Babel was likely based on a real building, the Etemenanki in modern day Iraq.",Happy
58," I did not now that, but it is certainly possible.  William Shakespeare wrote an incredible amount of material even though he died at 49 years old.",Neutral
58,Yes he did!  he is regarded ad the greatest writer in the English language!,Happy
58," I think I read the cliff notes to one of his plays, but I could never stay interested in his works!",Curious to dive deeper
58," I read the cliff notes of some of his things in college.  He coined a lot of popular phrases that we still use today like ""good riddance"" and ""wild goose chase"".",Happy
58,Yes those sayings certainly seemed to have stuck into modern language,Curious to dive deeper
58,Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.  Interesting facts.,Happy
58,I guess that would mean Lewis and Clark were exploring the Western United States while Shakespeare was performing plays in England!,Curious to dive deeper
58," Yes!  lol  Shakespeare invented the names Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia.  I never knew that.",Happy
58," Yes, true.  His works can be found in a library, which in Greek language means ""book+shelf"".",Curious to dive deeper
58,I love going to libraries!  I'm a heavy user of them.  It's been fun chatting with you!,Happy
58,Same thing to you. Good day.,Happy
58,You have a good day too!,Happy
59,There was man who was falsely imprisoned. He used the prison library to study law and learn to free himself. That is amazing don't you think?,Surprised
59," That is awesome! Speaking of libraries, there are more libraries than McDonalds in the United States. Do you have a library card?",Curious to dive deeper
59," I do and that is good to hear. Also, half of adult have library cards that seems like more than I would have thought.",Surprised
59," I know. I don't know that a lot of my friends go to the library. The Sacramento Library has instituted a type of library that might make going to the library more interesting to many. They started a library of things, so you can check out sewing machines and other things that you don't need to own for a long time.",Surprised
59,That would be so useful. I wonder if other cities do that? I know that normal library collections often included DVD's and CD's and other things besides books.,Happy
59," Yes, and I have also checked out passes to various museums in my city. I'm glad some people were dedicated to starting libraries in the past as they have been so useful to me. Have you heard of UK Prime Minister William Gladstone?",Curious to dive deeper
59," I have. I heard that he started a library in 1895 with 32,000 books in it. All from his personal collection. Can you imagine?",Happy
59,The more amazing thing to me is how he carted all those books by wheelbarrow over 3/4 mile. He was 85!,Surprised
59," Maybe his daughter helped him. I wonder how many were Shakespeare plays. I was reading one at the library. Did you know that Shakespear coined many of the terms we use today, including ""good riddance"" and ""laughing stock?""",Neutral
59," Oh, that's interesting. I would never have thought as luck would have it, break the ice, and full circle were from Shakespeare.",Surprised
59," I guess it makes sense that he coined so many terms since he was the world's greatest dramatist. Plus, he wrote so much. He wrote 39 plays!",Happy
59," Not only did he coin terms, but he created names. The names Miranda, Olivia and Jessica were invented by Shakespeare. I didn't know those names went so far back!",Surprised
59,That is interesting. I wonder if these names sound different with the accent of the time. I know the accent can affect the meaning of the performance. The old accent can introduce rhymes or puns that don't work with our modern tongue. What might Miranda sound like in Shakespeare's voice?,Curious to dive deeper
59,That is an interesting thought. Shakespeare has been translated into every major language. I wonder how they preserve Shakespeare's style and language in other languages.,Curious to dive deeper
59,That is a good question. It would be interesting to study that in school. I bet people use to study Shakespeare in school more than they do now. I hear that people often studied the Bible in school before 1963.,Curious to dive deeper
59," Yes, the Bible does still play a large role in our lives though. Presidents are still sworn in with them. I wonder why Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams did not use Bibles at their swearing in ceremonies.",Curious to dive deeper
59," That is true. It does play a role still. Plus it was influenced by real history. For example, the tower of Babel was probably based on a real building in what is now Iraq.",Neutral
59,Thomas Jefferson didn't seem to agree with all parts of the Bible. He made his own version and cut out the supernatural parts. I wonder why that was.,Surprised
59," Interesting!. All so at least three Presidents saw the Bible differently (Jefferson, Roosevelt and Adams.) Iti is interesting to think about how the Bible changes too. For example, the apple from Adam and Eve was a translation from the 4th century.",Surprised
59,That's true. And different Bible canons have evolved over the century with overlapping contents but also diverging contents.,Curious to dive deeper
59," Yes. In fact, the what is seen as canonical depends on the traditions of different groups.",Neutral
59,That is what cuases disagreement between CHristian denominations about what should be included in the canon.,Curious to dive deeper
60,Hi!  How much do you know about planets?,Curious to dive deeper
60," Hello - I know the alternate names for Earth are gaia, tellus, and telluris.",Neutral
60," That is awesome, I wonder why they settled on Earth.  It is the only one without a God/Goddess name.",Neutral
60,I saw that in 1975 the Soviet Union sent a spacecraft to Venus.,Surprised
60," Wow, maybe that is how they found out it doesnt tilt/",Neutral
60,You can fit every other planet between Earth and the moon/,Surprised
60," Wow, I didnt realize it was really that far away.  Does that include pluto, they can't decide about that poor planet.",Curious to dive deeper
60,I believe it does. There is a planet that orbits four stars.,Surprised
60,There is a planet where shards of glass rain sideways at 4500 mph in 2000 degree F weather.  No thanks.,Curious to dive deeper
60,That's crazy! Manned space stations orbit Jupiter are impossible due to the intense radiation.,Surprised
60,I would imagine.  I have heard there are pretty violent storms on Jupiter.,Neutral
60,I've heard that too. Even heard you can pick up the strong storms on Earth over radios,Surprised
60,Jupiter has a moon that could be considered a planet if it orbited the sun.,Neutral
60,Wow that's crazy. Do you know much about governors?,Curious to dive deeper
60," Some, I know Schwarzenegger never lived in Sacramento, he commuted daily by private jet.",Neutral
60,That would be hard to do. It says he went 3 hours per day by private jet. Talk about a long commute.,Surprised
60,i couldnt do that.  time is too valuable.,Neutral
60,I agree. Did you know that Athiests cannot be governor of South Carolina.,Surprised
60," Wow, I didnt know that.  Texas actually elected the first female governor.",Surprised
60,That's really good to know. The governor of Oklahoma has an Oklahoma shaped pool.,Surprised
60,Nice chat!  Have a great day!,Neutral
61,hello do you like dance?,Curious to dive deeper
61,I love it. Did you know Bruce Lee was a dancer too?,Curious to dive deeper
61,Yes pretty awesome he even won a cha -cha championship once,Curious to dive deeper
61," Yes, same with Tupac, he was a ballet dancer too",Curious to dive deeper
61," Yeah and he even was part of a nutcracker production, he was the mouse",Curious to dive deeper
61," Nice. Ballet dancers go through tons of shoes, 4 pairs a week",Curious to dive deeper
61,Yeah must cost a lot too. Babies are good at dancing too when they hear music,Curious to dive deeper
61," Yeah and they smile more once they hit the beat, smart",Curious to dive deeper
61,Yes super sweet. Jackson had a patent on a device that improved his dance moves,Curious to dive deeper
61,Nice. Do you like soundtracks?,Curious to dive deeper
61," Yes I do. Did you know Spielberg, when creating the soundtrack for Jaws, played the clarinet?",Curious to dive deeper
61,the Brother Where Art Thou one is 8 times certified platinum,Curious to dive deeper
61,Wow! That is impressive. Phil Collins speaks many languages and recorded the Tarzan ST in all of them.,Curious to dive deeper
61," Yes including german, spanish, italian, and french. Amazing",Curious to dive deeper
61,I know. The track title in the Batman Begins ST is named after a genius of a bat,Curious to dive deeper
61,Haha that is super creative. Do you ever read movie reviews?,Curious to dive deeper
61," I read them sometimes, I mostly rely on Rotten Tomatoes, and you?",Curious to dive deeper
61,Me too. Did you know Bay's average rating for his movies is just 38% there?,Curious to dive deeper
61,Wow that low? Movies based on video games also have a low rating there too,Curious to dive deeper
61,Yeah it seems. It is owned by Warner Bros,Curious to dive deeper
61,Yeah they seem to have their hand on everything,Curious to dive deeper
62,Are you a fan of dance?,Curious to dive deeper
62,Sure. I find the movement very aesthetically pleasing.,Neutral
62,They say that babies spontaneously dance to music. I suppose that shows there's something very fundamentally human in dance.,Surprised
62,Not just human! Parrots are able to dance perfectly to music. They speculate it's tied into their ability to mimic.,Neutral
62," Wow, I guess everything with a heartbeat probably feels some impulse to dance. More advanced forms of dance have aesthetic and symbolic value. ",Curious to dive deeper
62,Did you know Emilia Clarke did the funky chicken and robot dance to audition for Game of Thrones?,Neutral
62," LOL, no. Can't imagine how that would help her get the part? I do know that Bruce Lee once won a cha-cha competition in Hong Kong.",Surprised
62," That's pretty funny. Apparently, Mr. Rogers learned to breakdance on an episode.",Neutral
62,And rapper Tupac Shakur danced in the Nutcracker in high school. Sounds like he and Mr Rogers swapped paths along the way.,Happy
62," Haha. Like Bill Bailey, an old tap dancer and Michael Jackson! Bill Bailey was first recorded moonwalking in 1955.",Neutral
62,So someone was moonwalking for anyone (literally) moon walked?,Neutral
62,Ha! That's a funny way to put it. I wonder what the called it back then? Maybe if he had been wearing those ballet slippers that make drawings from the movements we could come up with a better name.,Neutral
62,I hear they go through four pairs of pointe shoes a week. Lots of wear.,Curious to dive deeper
62," Soundtracks are important in dance, as well as movies, too.",Neutral
62," Yep. And some become bigger hits than the movies, such as the soundtrack to ""O, Brother, Where Art Thou?"". It went octuple platinum.",Neutral
62,Alicia Keys wrote a song for the Men in Black soundtrack when she was only 16!,Neutral
62," That's impressive, although I haven't heard the tune. I know that Channing Tatum got his start dancing in Step Up when he was young. Met his wife that way.",Neutral
62," Yeah, it's too bad about their divorce.",Neutral
62," It appears to have been amicable, which is nice. They still describe each other as best friends.",Neutral
62,Step Up had a really fun soundtrack.,Neutral
62,But I think the critics hated it. I think it has 19% approval at Rotten Tomatoes.,Neutral
62," Rotten Tomatoes has some pretty high standards, though. Neither Ashton Kutcher or Jennifer Love Hewitt have been in movies with a ""Fresh"" rating.",Neutral
63,Good evening!  Do you know much about Maryland's governor?,Curious to dive deeper
63," Not too much,  so you?  Did you know that ralph lawrence carr was the only governor to oppose the internement of japanese americans during ww2?",Curious to dive deeper
63," I didn't know that.  Maryland's governor, Larry Hogan, is a republican who was under some hot water for policies on climate change.",Neutral
63," Thats interesting.  the beatles song""come together"" was written for 1969 governor campaign.",Curious to dive deeper
63," Larry Hogan could probably have used the support of a group like the Beatles, but I'm sure he will be ok.  At least he isn't as bad as North Dakota's in 1934 who actually seceded from the US for a short time!",Surprised
63,when schwarzenegger became governor of ca he commuted 3 hours everyday lol,Neutral
63," Maybe so he could leave the office every day and say ""I'll be back!""  ",Happy
63,haha good one!,Curious to dive deeper
63,Did you hear that Texas had a female governor before other states even allowed women to vote?,Curious to dive deeper
63,Yeah thats really interesting. did you know there hasnt been a us president who wasnt a rep or dem since 1853?,Curious to dive deeper
63," Wow!  We truly are a two party system, but don't try getting elected as president as a democrat with a beard.  So far all bearded presidents have been republican.",Happy
63," Im not excited about that,  I will never be president lol ",Curious to dive deeper
63,It's crazy to think that red/blue connotations for the parties isn't even 20 years old.,Surprised
63," Yeah it seems like that was always the case,  but I guess not.  ",Neutral
63," The Bush's had a heck of a run with three terms.  In fact, before Trump, you'd have to go back to 1928 to find an elected republican that didn't have nixon or a bush.",Surprised
63," Thats interesting,  do you know much about our planets?  The planet uranus rotates sideways instead of spinning. ",Curious to dive deeper
63,Crazy!  Jupiter is so big that it has moons that would be planets if they simply orbited the sun and Jupiter.,Neutral
63,That is cool.  there is a planet that shards of glass rain sideways at 4500 mph!!!  thats insane!,Curious to dive deeper
63,Wow.  There are some crazy planets out there.  Venus doesn't even have seasons because it doesn't tilt and rotates in a different direction than the rest of the planets that revolve around our sun.,Surprised
63," That is really interesting. I heard that astronauts can vote from space, lol. ",Curious to dive deeper
63,Must have been an absentee ballot!,Neutral
63," It's been fun chatting,  have a good one. ",Neutral
64,Have you ever used the Rotten Tomatoes website? I check out all the movies I'm going to watch on there first.,Curious to dive deeper
64," You know, I do to.  I feel it's better to be informed than waste my time or money without knowing.",Neutral
64,If I'm watching a movie at home I don't care about the reviews as much but definitely want to make sure I am getting my moneys worth at the theater.,Happy
64," Amen, to that.  Movie ticket prices are outrageous, nowadays.  Netflix has almost 150 movies that carry a 100% Rotten Tomatoes rating.",Surprised
64," I've found it has been so hard to find a movie on Netflix, I have been watching a lot of their original content lately though. Do you watch Netflix?",Curious to dive deeper
64,All the time.  It is another one of those companies created by college students.  Lol.  All I did in college was party!,Surprised
64," Yeah I didn't spend my time in college trying to make companies either, I wish I did though.",Neutral
64," Just a random note, did you realize that Bruce Lee wa such a good dancer?",Surprised
64," I did not, but with his athleticism and talent I am not surprised.",Happy
64,I know right!  He won the 1958 Cha Cha championship in Hong Kong.  I can not even picture that.,Surprised
64,I would like to see some video of that. I have only seen a couple of his movies.,Curious to dive deeper
64," Speaking of dancing, are you aware that Michael Jackson holds a patent on a dance device?",Surprised
64,I did not know that but if anyone would have one it's him.,Surprised
64," That's right, he was a master of dance.  This device apparently, helped him get that extreme lean that he did in some of his dances.",Neutral
64,Now that you mention it I do somewhat remember seeing how he did that. It was almost like a piece of metal that would lock into his shoe so he could almost lean 45 degrees. I believe he used it in the Smooth Criminal music video.,Happy
64," Looked very cool, when he did it!  I heard somewhere that Tupac danced ballet.  Have you heard anything about that?",Curious to dive deeper
64,I had heard he trained in the ballet. Did you know that the Air Jordan logo is him doing a ballet move?,Curious to dive deeper
64," Wow, I didn't know that!",Surprised
64,A lot of athletes have used ballet and now yoga to help with flexibility and reduce injuries!,Happy
64," Yes, I hear it does help tremendously.",Happy
64," I have taken yoga before but I need a few more classes before I get more flexible. It was fun chatting with you, have a great day!",Happy
65,hello,Neutral
65," Hello, Michael jackson has a patent. on a device used to achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves",Happy
65,That is extremely interesting actually. never knew that,Neutral
65,I didn't either.  I guess for the song Smooth Criminal.,Surprised
65,perhaps. what article you thought was the most interesting?,Neutral
65,Tupac danced ballet in high school and ended up portraying the mouse king in a production of the nutcracker.,Sad
65,I found interesting the concept with rotten tomatoes. Poor people,Happy
65," Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music, and smile more when they hit the beat.  Dance is so interesting. ",Happy
65," Dance truly is interesting. As for the babies dancing spontaneously when they hear music, I totally agree. My child does the same",Surprised
65,Mine do as well.  Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.,Surprised
65,That I certainly didn't know. She is still too little for ballet lol,Neutral
65,Michael bay's average rotten tomatoes film rating is 38%,Happy
65,Quite surprising. Also Netflix has almost 150 movies with 100% rating on rotten tomatoes,Happy
65,I was just reading that.  How cool is that? I like to watch some of the stuff on Netflix.,Surprised
65,I also like to watch movies on Netflix. Its convenient and the premium is not too high,Happy
65," Exactly, Spykids received a 93% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes, better than, say, lincoln or the dark knight rises.",Sad
65,true that. How about soundtracks. Any thoughts on that?,Happy
65,I didn't realize that Steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack.,Sad
65,Same here. Thought it was very interesting,Happy
65," No doubt.  The soundtrack to 'o brother, where art thou?' is certified 8 times platinum.",Curious to dive deeper
65,yep.pretty fascinating,Neutral
65,Thanks for the chat.  It was informative.,Neutral
65,same. have a good day,Happy
65," Thanks, you too.",Neutral
65,bye,Happy
66,How do you like planet earth?,Curious to dive deeper
66,I find the earth and the solar system very interesting!,Curious to dive deeper
66,It is so interesting! I love learning about planets. Like Jupiters mon Ganymede!,Curious to dive deeper
66," Yes, I agree! Isn't the Ganymede Jupiters own moon?",Curious to dive deeper
66," yea, it would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun, that is amazing",Curious to dive deeper
66," Very, Did you know our planet Earth has other names besides Gaia?",Curious to dive deeper
66," I didn't know there were any names besides Earth, lol. I guess maybe the blue planet, what other names do you know?",Curious to dive deeper
66,Tellus and Telluris!  very cool! This is also a planet that orbits four stars!,Surprised
66,wow! I love learning! I think I saw once that astronomers found a planet many light years away that could sustain life,Curious to dive deeper
66," Yes, I heard that too! Exciting!! Do you know anything about the solar asteroid belt?",Curious to dive deeper
66," I do not know too much, i just know there is crazy things that happen out there, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
66," True,  its has celestial bodies called Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta!",Curious to dive deeper
66," I need to tough up on my planet facts, you have so many! I know that five planets are visual with the naked eye in the sky",Curious to dive deeper
66," Yes, Aren't they interesting! Do you have a favorite planet? I think mine would be Jupiter and Venus!!",Curious to dive deeper
66," Mine is mars, I hope we get a man on mars in my lifetime, do you think it will happen/",Curious to dive deeper
66," Oh yes, Mars!! I love it too!! I hope so, There is a good chance we will. ",Happy
66," I bet, the more money we spend the better our chances. We just need some brave souls that are willing to take the chance like the first time we went to space!",Curious to dive deeper
66," Yes, very brave!! I hope we can do that sometime soon. Are there signs of water on Mars?",Curious to dive deeper
66,I think there have been theories of underground lakes and the potential of water. I will read up on it more. It was so nice chatting with you and getting good facts!,Curious to dive deeper
66," Really, I thought there was or at least they thought so!! Yes, enjoyed chatting too!",Curious to dive deeper
66,Have a great night!,Curious to dive deeper
67,Hi.  I guess Channig Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum are getting a divorce.  Sad.,Sad
67," Yes, I read about that in the news. The things he says about it almost sound too good to be true...maybe it's sarcastic?",Curious to dive deeper
67," Not sure... They were a good team.  I guess ""Step Up"" was a favorite for many.",Neutral
67," Seems like it. I never saw it, though.They are pretty talented to be good at both acting and dancing. Singing, too?",Surprised
67," I think so, the ""Step Up"" soundtrack had high acclaim. ",Curious to dive deeper
67,I think the movie tried to have an overall good message to be the best you can be in everything you do. Inspirational for many.,Happy
67,That's refreshing... I can see why ABC Family was mentioned.,Happy
67," Kids love to dance to soundtracks, too. I think they even have a few video games with dance and music",Curious to dive deeper
67," Yes, they do.  I didn't know Bruce Lee was also a great dancer.  I thought he just beat up bad guys. ",Surprised
67,That's really cool! I think Patrick Swayze was also a multi-talented actor dancer. He was in a very famous movie and that soundtrack is also great.,Curious to dive deeper
67,I can see him but Tupac?  I guess Tupac danced ballet in high school.  How can you hide a gun in tights?,Surprised
67,That sounds so crazy it might even be an urban legend! Ballet dancers go through a lot of shoes in just one week. Think how their feet feel!,Curious to dive deeper
67,Ouch!  I guess we are all dancers to some degree.  Babies naturally dance when they hear music.,Happy
67," I remember as kids we'd have birthday parties and dance to various Disney Soundtracks. Do they still make those, I wonder?",Happy
67," If they do, they are probably ""R"" rated.  Disney has changed for the worse.  I think it's great the Spielberg played clarinet in the Jaws soundtrack.",Surprised
67," Speilberg is amazing! It wouldn't surprise me if he could dance well, too! I wonder if he'd ever play an instrument in another soundtrack?",Curious to dive deeper
67," Don't know... I do know that Phil Collins recorded the Tarzan sound track in many different languages. Ilaian, German, etc. ",Surprised
67,That's amazing! I wonder if those are all rated on Rotten Tomatoes? It's owned by WB so I wonder if it's hard on Disney or other rivals?,Curious to dive deeper
67,I wonder if that biases their judgement for WB productions.  No film based on video games ever got a rating above 44% from RT.,Surprised
67," If you like video games, some of those movies are pretty good, too. I didn't realize Rotten Tomatoes was started by students until recently! Brilliant!, ",Happy
67,I kind of look at IMDB for ratings... Great chat! You were excellent!,Neutral
68," Hey do you like Star Wars? I know that I like the first three movies, the next three are ok, and I really hate the new ones",Curious to dive deeper
68," I love the original 3 like you. But the new ones are bad, I agree. ",Curious to dive deeper
68,Haha well I'm glad we agree on that. What did you think about Rogue one that came out in 2016? I thought it was a total disaster haha,Curious to dive deeper
68," I think any movie that relegates the Great Luke to the trash heap is nothing. ""No! I am your Father"" is the greatest scene of all time.",Curious to dive deeper
68," Oh I agree with you. I just feel bad that James Earl Jones only made about eight grand for doing the voice in the first movie, although it was only about two and a half hours of work, he hit it out of the park",Surprised
68,Really? That is bad. Have you ever scene the scenes without him and the original actor?,Surprised
68," Yes I have. Doesn't that guy have a Scottish accent or something? And I think he thought he was going to be the actual voice, very strange.",Happy
68,Hilarious. I think they are great though. I didn't know JEJ only spent 2.5 hours recording though!,Curious to dive deeper
68," Yeah I know, he did a great job for the limited time, can you believe that 20th Century Fox let George Lucas keep the merchandising rights, that's what made him a billionaire, so crazy I don't think they would do that ever again",Surprised
68," I think I can believe it. Good for him, what does the corporation need with something they didn't invent anyways?",Curious to dive deeper
68," No I agree with you. Are you going to watch the Academy Awards by the way? They give out 24 Awards and I think that the first broadcast was back in 1930, which is wild",Surprised
68," Yeah, so like the academy awards totally suck. Does anyone actually give a bleep what they think?",Curious to dive deeper
68," No I think that they don't really pick the best movies. A lot of good movies that I like a lot or never even nominated. I do like Daniel Day-Lewis though, I'm glad that he won three times for best actor",Happy
68," By the way, do you watch you tube? Much better than AA!",Curious to dive deeper
68,Yes I agree with you! I watch YouTube almost everyday. I can't believe that Google bought YouTube for 1.65 billion dollars back in 2006. That seems like so long ago,Surprised
68," Oh, I can believe it. Google could make it a success, Youtube couldn't succeed on it own. ",Curious to dive deeper
68," Yep I agree with you. Did you know that YouTube is the second biggest search engine, I assume that Google is the first",Surprised
68,I'm surprised it isn't the first to be honest!,Curious to dive deeper
68,Yeah I know that everyone uses YouTube do you ever watch the music video for Gangnam Style by the way. That is one of the highest viewed videos on youtube,Surprised
68," No, but I have watched it. Good song, good short term fad too!",Curious to dive deeper
68," Yep it was definitely a fad haha. So was Justin Bieber song Baby, I don't think it should be the most disliked video on YouTube, but it's definitely annoying",Surprised
69," Hello there, so have you seen any of the Star Wars movies?",Curious to dive deeper
69,I have seen several. I read Tran who played rose left Instagram after racist messages from fans.,Surprised
69," That is so sad fans are so cruel to people.  I have yet to see her in that movie, I really want to though. ",Curious to dive deeper
69,Me too. The last Jedi divided it's fans,Surprised
69,Yeah I think each movie does because there are so many of them and they all have their different tastes.  But the personal comments to the actors is just stupid.,Curious to dive deeper
69,Did you know Chloe Bennet changed her last name to get in to US easier,Surprised
69," No I didn't know that, I wonder how many people do that when they come here.  ",Surprised
69,Seems like a lot. Apparently they get more call backs with American last names.,Surprised
69," Yeah I can see that, and whatever helps for them I'm sure they will do.  Hey do you know how much James Earl Jones was paid for doing all the darth vader lines? ",Curious to dive deeper
69,No. What is it?,Curious to dive deeper
69," I guess he only got paid $7,500, but when I say only, it only took him two and a half hours to do them!",Curious to dive deeper
69,That's a lot for 2 and half hours.in 2018 star wars was worth $65 billion,Surprised
69," Holy cow, I wonder how much it was worth in 1998, probably less than half of that. ",Curious to dive deeper
69," In 2013 star wars was dubbed in Navajo, making it the first major film to be in navajo",Surprised
69,That is awesome!  Did you know Star Wars holds a Guinness World Record title?,Curious to dive deeper
69,No for what? Fox thought star wars would flop,Surprised
69,I guess they hold the record for most successful film merchandising franchise.  When I hear merchandising I think of that scene from Spaceballs.,Curious to dive deeper
69,Do you watch the academy awards? Eminem has more Oscars than Leonardo DiCaprio,Surprised
69,That is crazy!  I heard he has more than Johnny Depp and Will Smith as well.,Curious to dive deeper
69,The Oscars were nominated for 9 Emmys in 2013.,Surprised
69," What? That is so stupid to me, why an awards show?  Do you know who is the only actor to win best actor 3 times?",Curious to dive deeper
69,Daniel day Lewis I think.,Surprised
69," Good call!  He is a great actor though so I can see it, I wonder what roles he won for.  Maybe the butcher role in Gangs of New York. ",Curious to dive deeper
69,Probably. Blazing saddles was nomonanom for 3 Oscars too. Well have a great night.,Surprised
70," Hello, do you like Star Wars?",Curious to dive deeper
70,I don't really though I do respect it as a franchise. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
70,Yeah I like it. Lucas' wife made such changes to the script that she won the Academy Award,Curious to dive deeper
70," Star Wars is the second highest grossing film series of all time. It's spawned into a bunch of other media like books, video games, theme parks.",Curious to dive deeper
70,Yeah it has certainly taken over everything. It was even dubbed in Navajo,Curious to dive deeper
70,Cool! James Cameron decided to quit being a truck driver so that he could enter the film industry after watching Star Wars. I guess that was the right decision.,Surprised
70," Oh for sure it was, the guy is a legend now. James Earl Jones got only $7500 recording Darth Vader's lines",Curious to dive deeper
70,Crazy! Fox thought Star Wars was going to flop and agreed to George Lucas's proposition to forgo an extra $500K directing fee so that he could keep licensing and merchandising rights. Their decision cost them billions of dollars,Surprised
70,Yeah and at the same time made Lucas a billionaire. He just had a lot of confidence in his work,Curious to dive deeper
70," Yeah, in 2018 the whole Star Wars franchise was estimated at $65 billion",Surprised
70,That is insane. Do you watch the Academy Awards?,Curious to dive deeper
70," No, I don't. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
70,I watch it sometimes. Did you know Daniel Day-Lewis has won the Oscar 3 times?,Curious to dive deeper
70,I am not sure I even know who he is. Good for him. John Williams has been nominated for more Oscars than anyone besides Walt Disney.,Surprised
70,Yeah Disney is going to be hard to reach by anyone else with 22 Oscars,Curious to dive deeper
70,He got a special Oscar in 1938 for snow white that had a regular sized statuette and seven miniature oscars.,Surprised
70,That is amazing. Eminem has more Oscars than Leonardo DiCaprio and some other big names.,Curious to dive deeper
70," Speaking of Oscars, Kelly Marie Tran went to them. She is the first non white woman in Star Wars leading role.",Surprised
70,That is amazing. Have you seen the movie Blazing Saddles?,Curious to dive deeper
70,I have not seen it. Tran faced a lot of racist and abusive language on her social media though. That's sad.,Sad
70,That is just sad. I hope we move towards behaving as we should with each other. Nice chat :),Happy
71,Hi there!  Are you a Star Wars fan?,Curious to dive deeper
71," Hi, Yes I am a star wars fan!!! Since I was a kid. What about you?",Happy
71,Yes!  Mostly when it comes to the Original trilogy.  Those are the best.,Neutral
71," It is amazing how star wars was created long time ago , in 1977 and with a movie made last year , the star wars fever is so alive!",Happy
71,It has to be one of the most sucessful franchises ever.  40 years and still has a great following.,Neutral
71," It is incredible that the first eight films were nominated for academy awards, they were able to  create wonderful productions!",Happy
71,The total value of the franchise was about $65 billion.  It will definitely always be a legend!,Surprised
71,And 20 century fox though star wars was going to be a failure!!,Surprised
71," I heard that, apparently so did Harrison Ford, I heard he didnt want to be credited in the film initially.",Neutral
71," Is that right! Well, good for George Lucas because this poor vision from 20 century made him a billionaire",Happy
71,It definitely did.  Do you know how much James Earl Jones was paid to record Darth Vader's lines?,Curious to dive deeper
71," I believe it was $7,500, and he just spent 2 hours and a half doing so",Happy
71," Isnt that crazy?  Some of those lines are so iconic, and he got so little for them.  Shame.",Neutral
71," I agree, it is basically nothing.. Did you know George Luca's wife influenced the star wars movies a lot?",Surprised
71," Yeah, didnt she receive an editing award too?",Curious to dive deeper
71,She got an award for editing!! I think she made an important contribution.. good job,Happy
71,She definitely changed some parts significantly.  It would have been far different without her.,Neutral
71," Yes, she did major changes.. and is interesting George did not get the award for directing!",Happy
71,Eminem has more oscars than George Lucas!  That is hard to believe!,Neutral
71," Wow, and he has won more awards than Leo Di Caprio, Johnny Depp and Bill murray combined",Surprised
71," I didnt realized he had any at all, I wonder what they were all for.",Curious to dive deeper
71," Have to check!! Do you know who has won , best actor 3 times?",Surprised
71,Who?  Harrison Ford?,Neutral
71," It is Daniel Day Lewis, what an accomplishment",Surprised
71," It really is!  It has been great chatting, but I must go.  have a great night!",Neutral
71,You do the same!!,Happy
72,Government is fascinating. It seems so different the world over yet there are common threads in every type.,Curious to dive deeper
72," I agree. Some governments try to help, others, not so much.",Neutral
72,So true. I wonder what america would look like if we had a PM instead of a president. A PM seems to be held more accountable for their actions.,Curious to dive deeper
72,True. Much easier to remove. Australia's PM position isn't in the constitution and exists only through custom. That seems strange to me. Not in the Constitution?,Neutral
72,Australia's constitution is weird though. It doesn't protect the people as much like an american one does.,Curious to dive deeper
72,I did not know that. Number 10 Downing Street has a cat with a title! I wonder how many other government headquarters have animals like that.,Curious to dive deeper
72,With all the historic buildings in the UK I could see why they need one. Older structures like that tend to attract rodents.,Neutral
72,Is one cat enough though? Might need a support staff.,Neutral
72,Right? lol. I wonder if you can meet the cat if you tour the offices?,Curious to dive deeper
72,The cat doesn't take visitors without an appointment.,Neutral
72,I could see the cat being involved in a lot of the pranks the UK officials seem to play on each other.,Neutral
72," When you turn 100 in japan, the PM gives you a silver cup to celebrate. Too many people are turning 100 so that they had to find a way to make cheaper cups. Maybe give the cup when people turn 200?",Neutral
72,That would be one way to cut the costs. How many people are turning 100 that it is costing enough to have to find a cheaper solution? Talk about a healthy society.,Curious to dive deeper
72," Yeah. Celebrating a centennial is cool, but the gov't can't afford it! Are you a fan of Johnny Depp?",Neutral
72,I find him very interesting. He is one of those chameleon actors that you never watch and go Oh that's Johnny Depp he sort of absorbs the character.,Curious to dive deeper
72,Johnny  is producing and maybe starring in a biopic about  Dr. Seuss. I would be interested in that.,Neutral
72,I think he would make a fantastic Dr. Seuss Look what an amazing job he did with willy wonka. I think the creepy edge he gave to the character was perfect.,Neutral
72," He is really dedicated to his craft. Edward Scissorhands was an odd film, but he made it work.",Neutral
72,That whole movie was just weird. He might be a strange man but he seems to really have a good heart.,Neutral
72,I know that he often visits children in the hospital dressed up as a pirate.,Neutral
72,He seems to really be an animal lover too.,Happy
73," Many people like to watch horror films, I don't like slashers but like some like World War Z, did you know the horror film genre has been around for more than a century?",Curious to dive deeper
73," oh yes, I even watched the first ""Nosferatu"" movie - not sure when that was made but it's quite old...",Happy
73," That one is a  classic, based on the book by Bram Stoker.  They say if you watch a horror movie you will enjoy abstract art more, maybe because they are both a horror?",Happy
73,I always loved horror movies... they work good on Your imagination ;),Curious to dive deeper
73," They are good for your health as well, guess why?",Curious to dive deeper
73,Horrors good for Your health ? You poop more often ? I don't know ;),Surprised
73," Ha, that or have a heart attack, no seriously, you burn 180 calories watching a horror movie, wonder what other types of cinema burn?",Curious to dive deeper
73," I mean if the movie really scares You, than maybe, but what if You just like the story, but it's no longer scary for You, because You've seen it all ? ;)",Curious to dive deeper
73," I can't imagine not being scared watching a horror movie, thats why I like other forms of cinema.  Do you know cinematogrrpahy is the science of motion picture photography and important to all types of movies?",Curious to dive deeper
73," well sure, it's just hundreds of pictures with sound in the background ;)",Curious to dive deeper
73," The art is making them look good with the right music and sound to tell a story.  Do youknow the guy who pioneered the use of the wide angle lens won aan oscar but was not a citizen until '43 and illegally married a white woman because he was Chinese American, we have done some stupid things in our past treatment of others.",Curious to dive deeper
73," I mean I wouldn't say it's stupid... if he was here illegally, that means he broke the law... there was no legal way to get here ?",Surprised
73," He was her and became a citizen, the law he broke was marrying a white woman because he was asian. That is crazy.",Happy
73," ahhh, I did not get that. So he came it legally ? and he couldn't marry white woman ? Was that a law ? What year was that ??",Surprised
73," His marriage did not become legal until 1948, prior to that it was considered illegal.  No woman has every been nominated for best cinematography Oscars either, so I guess there are still some issues.",Surprised
73,There will always be issues with race... but we're getting there...,Curious to dive deeper
73,I like the fantasy escape from all of our problems we find at the box office.  I guess others do to since Tom Hanks has made over 8.5 billion.,Surprised
73," I mean good for him, he was always very talented, but honestly, I don't remember seeing any new movie with him, do You ?",Surprised
73," I haven't seen anything new in a long time,  I did love Forest Gump, and You've got Mail though.  I really like Disney movies, do you know Sleeping Beauty was such a failure they considered closing down.",Happy
73," lol, no I didn't know that. I have a beef with Disney thou... I loved it when I was a kid, but since they've destroyed Star Wars... they're dead to me ;)",Sad
73," I prefer the original 3 from my childhood in the 70's.  Hopefully they learn something from their flops like Treasure planet, not that was a waste of money.",Curious to dive deeper
73," yes. just because its Disney and it has to be ok for kids ? make a division for adults and start making decent movies... You have the budget, technicians... nothing would stop them...",Curious to dive deeper
73,I think they have a separate division but can't remember what it is called.  I'm not sure I'd like to see the name Disney on a film like Silence of the Lambs though.,Surprised
73,Why not... it was a great movie. Classic. but I see what You 're saying. No I mean make movies like Star Wars for a little bit mature audience... don't focus on 6year olds because there are millions of 60 year old wanted to see how the story continues...,Curious to dive deeper
73,We never get to see the rebuilding of the galaxy and having Leia and Han's son kill Han and be bad was a stupid thing to do.,Happy
73,it was a poor choice yes. and the way they showed Luke was not to my liking either...,Curious to dive deeper
73," They made him seem like he regressed into some kind of whiney baby, at his age and experience he should be evolving more like Ben Kenobi or even Yoda, not woah is me I need a xanex Luke",Sad
73," That's my point exactly ! He was Vader's son ! Son of a person born out of force.. in my mind, he should be leading everybody to defeat Siths OR maybe share the faith of his father and go the the dark side... but not this...",Curious to dive deeper
73," It was so frustrating and annoying.  Vader's turn to the bright side at the end should have affirmed him and gave him deterination to continue, and why have Han's son be so bad, that is just pointless,  I guess they couldn't think of a bad guy.",Disgusted
73,I think they are preparing a twist of action nobody is suspecting but I think it's in a bad taste. I personally think Han Solo lives ;),Happy
73," I won't even pay to see the rest of them,  the cinematography is great though.",Disgusted
73,Absolutely ;) no argument here ;),Happy
73," If I was a better cinematographer, I'd make my own movies, but thats not in the cards.  Its been nice visiting with you.",Happy
73," Same here, thank You so much for fun conversation ! ;)",Happy
74,Hey there what do you know about the prime minister of the UK?,Curious to dive deeper
74,I don't know that much actually. He has a cat though.,Curious to dive deeper
74,I love the name of the cat. The name is Chief Mouser of the cabinet office LOL can't say I like cats though haha,Surprised
74,Hilarious. What happens if someone is allergic?,Curious to dive deeper
74,I am actually allergic to cats. And that's a great question haha do you know who Helena Bonham Carter is?,Curious to dive deeper
74," yeah, she was in Fight Club, other than that I don't remember many of the movies with her. ",Curious to dive deeper
74,Apparently she's related to the prime minister of the United Kingdom during World War I. That's very bizarre,Surprised
74,Really? That is pretty weird. Did you know if you hit 100 in japan they give you a silver cup?,Curious to dive deeper
74,I did not know that. It's funny that so many people turned 100 they had to find a way to make cheaper cups though haha,Surprised
74," Hilarious, at least they are healthy there. ",Curious to dive deeper
74,That's true they're definitely not giving those Awards away in the United States haha. I do like that Norway donated a billion dollars to save the Amazon rainforest though that's very nice of them,Happy
74," Yeah, that seems interesting, do they do a lot of business there? ",Curious to dive deeper
74,I'm not sure actually. They might have just donated it because they're nice. Unlike The guy who sold the Eiffel Tower twice who definitely just wanted the money haha,Surprised
74," That's hilarious, he wasn't even the owner. Did you know Johnny Depp directed the film brave? ",Curious to dive deeper
74,Oh I didn't know that. Have you seen that movie is it any good?,Curious to dive deeper
74," I haven't actually. LOL BTW, apparently 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the US Government. ",Curious to dive deeper
74,Wow that is a lot. Very strange that Johnny Depp is making a movie about dr suess. But I think he would be great for the role,Curious to dive deeper
74," I think that may have already have been released, but maybe I am wrong. ",Curious to dive deeper
74,It does sound familiar. Have you seen the movie Edward Scissorhands? Apparently Johnny Depp only says about 200 words,Curious to dive deeper
74," It's been a very long time, but yeah I saw it. Now that I think about it, he barely speaks in that film! ",Curious to dive deeper
74,You're right. I do love that movie a lot though. It's a great winter movie. Johnny Depp seems like a nice guy. He adopted his one-eyed horse from the movie Sleepy Hollow when he heard it was going to be put down,Happy
75," hi, do you like johnny depp?",Curious to dive deeper
75," Hi, how are you? Who is Johnny Depp? A singer? An athlete?",Neutral
75," He is an actor. He is the one that directed the movie The Brave, if you have seen it",Curious to dive deeper
75,I have not seen it. Is it about brave people or an Indian brave? Is he an American Indian?,Neutral
75,I think he might be partly american indigenous. I am not sure though.,Curious to dive deeper
75,Is he pretty ethnic? I think he'd have to be pretty ethnic to pull that off. Not like Elvis. Was Johnny a friend of Nic Cage?,Curious to dive deeper
75,He might be I am not sure. He even adopted the one eyed horse that was in the movie saleepy hollow,Curious to dive deeper
75,A one-eyed horse? That sounds odd. What is so charming about Cyclops the Horse? I guess you would have to put an eyepatch over one of the eyes.,Neutral
75,They were going to put the horse down so he wanted to save it,Curious to dive deeper
75," I guess he had a place for keeping horses. Do you know much about government? I am not a fan of government. It seems like a useful invention, much like a one-eyed horse.",Neutral
75,Me either but I do find it strange that the govnerment owns 86% of the land in Nevada,Curious to dive deeper
75,I figure the gov't must be up to something in that Nevada desert. War games? Alien spaceports?,Neutral
75,I have no idea they are certainly using it for something. Did you ever play nintendo?,Curious to dive deeper
75,I played a bit. I warn't into them games. I had other chores to attend to on the farm/prison where I growed up. You? Did you play them games?,Curious to dive deeper
75,Sounds rough. Do you know about wikileaks?,Curious to dive deeper
75," I applied for a job there, but they didn't hire me. Said my background wasn't suspicious enough. ",Neutral
75,Hahhaha that is funny. did you know they figured out the government is trying to destroy them,Curious to dive deeper
75," Well, they are Wikileaks, so they have a list of enemies pretty long. ",Neutral
75,Yes that makes sense. Did you know a man in france sold the eiffer tower twice?,Curious to dive deeper
75," That man could probably sell the govt's land in Nevada for us! Well, I've had a swell time chatting!",Neutral
75," Same here, have a good one.",Happy
76,Hi! Did you know the Prime Minister of Australia's position isn't actually in their constitution but only exists through custom? I find that surprising!,Surprised
76,Wow I didn't know that. I also didn't know that the Prime Minister selects and then can dismiss members of the cabinet. I always wondered what they did,Surprised
76," It's a little strange, isn't it? But on a lighter note, a radio station prank called Queen Elizabeth II back in 95, pretending to be Jean Chretien who was the Prime Minister of Canada back then. Ha!",Happy
76," That is very strange. Do you know who Helena Bonham Carter is? She was in the Harry Potter movies, but anyway she is the great-granddaughter of a prime minister",Surprised
76," Is that so? I wonder if she used her family to become an actress? Ha! Well in Japan, their Prime Minister sends their residents a silver cup when they turn 100 to celebrate it. Problem is, so many are turning 100 now, they're having to find ways to make cheaper cups. That's a good thing though!",Happy
76," That is a good thing! What do you think about Wikileaks by the way? Apparently the government try to destroy them, but Wikileaks just leaked their plans LOL",Happy
76," That's kind of ironic, isn't it? I wonder if Wikileaks will tell us what the government does with the 86% of Nevada's land that they own?",Curious to dive deeper
76," That is a good question. Maybe it is Area 51 that they own haha? It's also crazy to think that Norway donated a billion dollars to help save the rainforest, I wonder if they own the land or just donated it",Surprised
76,That's a good question. I'm glad they're taking action to protect the rainforests though! Did you ever hear about the guy in France who posed as a government official and sold the Eiffel Tower twice? It's like how did he pull that off? Someone like him could sell fire in hell! Ha!,Surprised
76,Haha yes a very talented salesman for sure! Definitely a scam too. What do you think about the actor Johnny Depp by the way? He likes to live in France,Curious to dive deeper
76,Does he really? I think he's a great actor. Although I'm not sure about his directing skills as I still haven't seen The Brave that he directed back in 1997!,Neutral
76," No I've never even heard of that movie. I do know that gives a good actor, I loved him in Edward Scissorhands even though he only said 196 words",Surprised
76,That is weird to have so few lines like that! I can't believe Gene Wilder didn't watch the Willy Wonka remake because he didn't want to be disappointed in Depp. That is a little disappointing to me.,Sad
76,Yes that is disappointing. I hope that Johnny Depp goes through with making a biopic about dr. Seuss. That would actually be my first choice for a person to play him,Happy
76," Agreed. That would be cool to see. I mean, I think that film would earn him another academy award nomination. I mean, He's already been nominated for three!",Neutral
76," Yes that is impressive! He seems like a nice guy, he adopted a one-eyed horse in one of his movies because they were going to put it down, that's nice thing to do",Happy
76," That's a very nice and humane thing to do! He's certainly come a long way since his rise in the 1980s with 21 Jump Street, hasn't he?",Happy
76," Yes absolutely! It's crazy that he was born in 1963, I remember when he was just a young man",Surprised
76,Absolutely! Back when he was just becoming a teen idol before going on to win Best Actor at both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actor's Guild Awards!,Neutral
76,Yes absolutely! I never knew that he was actually named John Christopher Depp II though. I wonder if his dad was also an actor?,Curious to dive deeper
76," I wonder that as well now that you mention it! Hey, maybe one day he'll run for a position in the government! Ha! I'm sure he's wise enough to know each government has a constitution in place which as you know is a statement of its philosophies and principles! Well it was great chatting with you! Have a good evening, friend!",Neutral
77," How's it going, do you watch Horror films? The first ones were inspired by Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelley",Curious to dive deeper
77," I love horror movies, I am a stephen king fan!",Curious to dive deeper
77,It's kinda strange Stephen King considers bambi a horror movie,Surprised
77," Right, it must have made him so scared as a kid. I think about the shining sometimes, good movie. The boy in the movie didnt know it was a horror movie until years later",Curious to dive deeper
77,I'm surprised the boy from the shinning couldn't figure out he was in a horror movie from the scenes with the bloody elevator and creepy twins,Surprised
77," right, or the guy breaking down the door. I wonder how the movie was at the box office",Curious to dive deeper
77," Probably pretty scary, apparently you can burn more than 180 calories watching a horror movie",Surprised
77,Dang I need to watch like 10 per night for my diet since I don't do anything else lol,Curious to dive deeper
77,Watching horror movies also makes viewing abstract art more enjoyable too,Neutral
77," I wonder how that works, do you know the science behind it?",Curious to dive deeper
77," I have no clue, probably something to do with psychology that makes abstract art more enjoyable after a horror movie",Neutral
77," I bet. You know what else is scary, Treasure Island by disney only made 309 dollars on a 15000000 dollar budget!",Curious to dive deeper
77," Yea, that is pretty horrible. Treasure Planet by Disney was also a huge box office flop",Neutral
77," sorry I meant treasure planet lol. Silence of the lambs came out on valentines day, imagine that date? lol",Curious to dive deeper
77,Well it couldn't of been that bad since Silence of the lambs made 270 million at the box office,Neutral
77," for sure, I mean bringing your date to it! Almost as crazy as disney almost shutting down their studios because of sleeping beauty failing",Curious to dive deeper
77," That is crazy. Do you like Tom Hanks, he's grossed over 8.5 billion at the box office",Curious to dive deeper
77," Man, he should be in every movie at that much money! Youre guaranteed to make money at that rate i think",Curious to dive deeper
77," Yea, Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office draw",Neutral
77," That is amazing, great actor! good chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
77,Have a good one,Neutral
78,Good Morning! Do you like to watch horror films?,Surprised
78," Hi, how are you? I am not really a fan of the genre, though I have some favorites.",Neutral
78,What are some of your favorite ones? Stephen king considers Bambi one haha.,Surprised
78," King was just a kid, to be fair. That movie could be scary to a tiny child. He then turned his fright into a profession.",Neutral
78,You're right on that one. Did you know you can burn 180 calories watching one?,Surprised
78," I suppose that I could try to lose weight that way. It might be easier to exercise. I like a couple of films, but after the first viewing, they are not as scary.",Neutral
78,Just do a marathon one day of watching them and you'll be set. Have you seen the Shining? The boy actor didn't even know it was a horror film until years later.,Happy
78,I liked the Shining. King wrote a great story and it translated well to the screen. I am surprised by the kid though. What did he think it was?,Neutral
78,That is a good question. You would think watching the cinematography alone would let you know it was one!,Surprised
78,I wonder if he ever saw the film while he was a kid. I think maybe his parents wouldn't let him.,Neutral
78,That could be it! Did you know no woman has ever been nominated for best cinematography at the oscars?,Surprised
78," That is a shame. I don't know how many women cinematographers there are, but probably not enough. There should be more.",Neutral
78,I agree with you! Especially with the box office at what it is. I would hate to work for the movie Trojan Wars. They made only 309 dollars on a budget of 15 million!,Surprised
78," Movies are such a crapshoot. There is no magic formula for success. Stars, special FX, marketing. Doesn't matter.",Neutral
78," They really are, even with the big names. Tom Hanks has earned 8.5 billion in film earnings for his movies.",Happy
78,He is a bankable star. People love him. But he also works with certain people regularly. Spielberg. Zemeckis. They are capable directors.,Neutral
78,Oh for sure! Have you seen Disney's Treasure Planet? That was one of the most expensive box office flops ever.,Surprised
78,I did not. Was that animated? Usually animated stuff is pretty good. I'm surprised.,Neutral
78," I am surprised too, especially with the Disney name attached to it!",Surprised
78,I guess a lot depends on the director. I don't know who directed Treasure Planet.,Neutral
78,I am going to google that now. Have a good day!,Surprised
79,Are you a soccer or tennis fan?,Curious to dive deeper

79," No, what was that?",Curious to dive deeper
79," Well they want a lot of Awards this year, and I think they're going to do even better next year",Happy
79,I will have to follow them. Tennis is fun too. a black man won the us open in 1968 and no other black man has since then. That would be award worthy,Curious to dive deeper
79," Yes they should make a movie about him! it's interesting to that until 1978 you could use any object as a tennis racket, that sounds dangerous",Surprised
79,That would be hilarious to see what some  people came up with. What would  you use? lol,Curious to dive deeper
79,I would use a rocket launcher LOL just kidding. do you watch soccer at all? Apparently soccer makes more than all other sports combined,Curious to dive deeper
79," Lol that would be perfect, no opponent means you  win everytime! ",Curious to dive deeper
79," That's a great point! Did you know that table tennis is the name of the actual sport, and that ping pong is only the name of the company that sells the table tennis equipment?",Surprised
79," I did not know that, wow! Mind blown! Back to soccer, did you have a favorite team in the world cup?",Curious to dive deeper
79,No I don't. I really don't like soccer I think it's boring LOL it's weird to me that the Super Bowl is smaller than soccer's biggest events,Surprised
79," it is boring, but it is kind of fun to watch one week per 4 years lol. I liked Brazil",Curious to dive deeper
79," Well soccer is a good exercise though, apparently a player will run about 7 miles per game, that's good for burning calories",Surprised
79," so good, they always have tight bodies lol. There was a german soccer player who donated 300000 euros to help pay for surgeries in brazil",Curious to dive deeper
79," That's really nice of him! What a nice guy, why do you think Greenland can't join FIFA? Apparently it's because they can't grow green grass LOL",Surprised
79," lol, that is a valid point but don't you think they could use turf? That is a little wrong i think ",Curious to dive deeper
79," Yep I agree it seems stupid. I don't know why they need to play on grass specifically, did you hear about the longest tennis point of all time?",Curious to dive deeper
79,I didn't what was that?,Curious to dive deeper
79," I was asking about the longest point in pro tennis, apparently it lasted for 29 minute straight, it was a 600 shot rally, that's incredible",Surprised
79," Wow, great chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
80,Hello,Curious to dive deeper
80,Hi. Do you play tennis?,Curious to dive deeper

80,I once watched a match where single point lasted nearly 30 minutes. It was historic,Neutral
80," Wow, They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 us open",Curious to dive deeper

80,That is a little late isn't it or do Canadians graduate at a later age?,Curious to dive deeper
80," Haha, that is very late.  Probably a ssllooww learner.  The beat of drake's song ""hotline bling"" is actually sampled from timmy thomas' 1972 hit ""why we can't live together"".",Curious to dive deeper
80,I absolutely love his music!,Happy
80," During a uk tour in 2011, drake spent an Obscene amount of money'' on first editions of children's classic books  Charlotte's web' and  Winnie the pooh'.",Surprised
80,I wonder why he would do that. He doesn't seem like he is into reading seeing as though he graduated high school so late,Surprised
80," Good question.  After hearing eminem's verse on drake's song forever, kanye west took two days and cancelled appointments to rewrite his.",Curious to dive deeper
80,Didn't Drake do some acting when he was younger?,Curious to dive deeper

80," They named a college after him too, didn't they?",Neutral
80,I'm not sure about that.,Curious to dive deeper
80,I'm gonna go listen to his album on YouTube now.,Neutral
81," Hello,  how are you doing? Soccer makes more money than football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey combined.",Surprised
81," Hello, I'm doing great. Have you ever watched the variation that has three teams, instead of two?",Curious to dive deeper
81,Nope.  Did you know Jon stewart was a skilled soccer player in college and represented the us at the pan american maccabi games in brazil in 1983.,Neutral
81," I do not follow soccer, I do remember reading about the German player who donated his bonus so 23 kids could have surgery.",Surprised
81," Wow so generous!  thats amazing! Americans call it ""soccer"" because it was slang for association football",Neutral
81,I find it fascinating that they used to dry the tennis couts for the 69' US Open with helicopters. I would have loved to see that.,Happy
81,Seems like a huge expense lol,Neutral
81," I didn't know the rapper Drake, was Canadian, did you?",Surprised
81," Yes. During a uk tour in 2011, drake spent an ""obscene amount of money'' on first editions of children's classic books 'charlotte's web' and 'winnie the pooh'.",Neutral
81," That's sweet, and it's interesting that he chose to graduate at 25, instead of getting his GED.",Surprised
81," Yeah,  maybe he really liked his friends that were still in the high school. ",Neutral
81," Kanye is so sensitive, I cannot believe that he actually cancelled appointments to rewrite his part of a song with Drake, after hearing Eminiem's verse.",Curious to dive deeper

81,The rapper drake visited drake university in the middle of the night after students gave up trying to get him to visit during a tour stop.,Neutral

81," Yes,  that was very interesting,  although either way he still would've made a lot of money",Neutral
81," I think One Dance is my favorite by him, it's also one of his most popular.",Happy
81," me too,  that song was great!  good talking to you ",Neutral
82," Hi, do you know anything about lacrosse?",Happy
82," Hello there, I don't know too much I will say, how about you",Curious to dive deeper
82,Not a ton... I love sports though so I could get into it if I needed to. Do you like any other sports?,Happy

82,I do. I used to play a lot but not any more. Do you play too?,Curious to dive deeper
82," I have tried to play a few times, but that game is pretty tough.  Did you know you could use any object as a racket until 1978?  Wonder if anyone ever used anything strange. ",Curious to dive deeper
82,Probably but not in serious competitions. A tennis player actually invented the polo! Who knew!,Surprised
82," Lol, that is pretty funny, and now they have the polo players on there, I bet the company wants people to think they invented them. ",Curious to dive deeper
82," The player was Rene ""The crocodile"" lacoste. His company uses the alligator and is called Lacoste still!",Surprised
82," That is awesome, yeah I still see the alligator shirts around a bit these days.  What a cool name!",Curious to dive deeper
82,They use helicopters to dry us open tennis courts. Who knew!,Surprised
82,I heard about that!  During a major tournament or something right?,Curious to dive deeper
82," Yeah, the US open. Seems like they should have been more prepared.",Happy
82," Yeah, but, to me that is pretty good improvisation for whoever came with that idea. ",Curious to dive deeper
82,Agreed. I work in recreation facilities and would not have thought of calling in a helicopter for any of my isssues.,Happy
82,Right same here (if i did work in that area).  Do you know what the longest rally was in tennis history?,Curious to dive deeper
82,I have no idea. How long?,Curious to dive deeper
82," It was a 643 shot rally that went on for almost 30 minutes!  That is insane, those people must have been tired after that one lol. ",Curious to dive deeper

83,Do you know how to play the guitar?,Curious to dive deeper
83,No. I wish that I did,Sad
83," Same here. Whenever i watch people, it looks so easy to pick up and learn... until you actually try to learn and realize its alot harder than it looks hah. Taking the time to build up muscles in your fingers is hard work.",Surprised
83,Its a great musical instrument,Happy
83,This is true. That statement also goes well with piano's. There's so many talented artists out there that can play the piano and guitar. Did you know that Freddie Mercury used the same piano to record Bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude? That must be a super lucky piano.,Curious to dive deeper
83,Yes. That piano must be worth a bit of money,Surprised
83,I could only imagine. I wonder where they keep that piano.,Neutral
83,it should be in the rock and roll hall of fame,Happy
83,As it should be. It would be so awesome to see it in person.,Neutral
83,A long time ago at the fillmore east I saw grand funk railroad. Talk about loud and sparks flying,Happy

84," Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, and is more modern.",Curious to dive deeper
84,It did spread around the world and gave origin to different styles around the world,Happy
84," It has spread so there is now a programming language in which the programs are written in musical composition, and functional programs have jazz-like harmonies.",Surprised
84,Great! I also love the dance-oriented swing big bands like the Kansas city jazz,Happy
84," Many people, even Clint eastwood are lifelong jazz enthusiasts, and scored several films, including million dollar baby",Surprised

85,Interesting.  I don't think of jazz when I think of Pakistan.,Curious to dive deeper
85," Me either lol. Eddie Van Halen set his studio speakers on fire when he recorded the guitar solo for ""beat it"".",Surprised
85,Whoa!  His playing was literally on fire.  lol  Brian May from Queen uses coins as guitar picks.,Happy
85,That's cool I've heard of people using coins before.,Surprised
85,It probably would give it a different sound I would think since you're strumming the strings with a metal and not plastic pick.,Surprised
85,I bet you're right on that. He also has a PHD in astrophysics.,Surprised
85,Interesting.  The guitarist from Pink Floyd turned a houseboat into a recording studio.  Crazy stuff.,Happy
85,That's funny. A group climb Britain's highest mountain back in 2006 and found a piano on top.,Surprised
85,I couldn't even imagine the ordeal it would have been for whomever had to take that piano up there originally.  An aluminum grand piano weighs 356 pounds and that's light compared to a regular piano.,Surprised

86," I didnt hear about that mute man, sounds like an interesting anecdote",Curious to dive deeper
86," Almost as strange as Richard Nixon's piano concerto, which he wrote and performed it live on the Tonight Show",Neutral
86,He did? I dint know he played the piano what other instruments do you like maybe the guitar?,Curious to dive deeper

90,What if you had money on it though? That would make it worth it.,Neutral
90,I think I would be more interested in the helicopter that dried the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US Open.,Surprised
90,I guess hair dryers were not powerful enough then. A helicopter? That's a rich person's solution.,Neutral
90," And wait, grass tennis court? I wonder how well the ball bounced. Probaby grass cut really short but still.",Curious to dive deeper
90," Yeah, there are three kinds of courts. I guess grass has its effect on the ball. Do you use Google much?",Curious to dive deeper
90," Oh yeah, more than I shoud. I know I'm not the only one. In 2013 Google went down for five minutes and took 40 percent of web traffic with it.",Surprised
90," People are so dependent on the Internet. If civilization collapsed, the first thing they would do is search Google for a solution.",Neutral
90," Kind of related, but I have totally tried to Google things when my power is out. Haha.",Curious to dive deeper
90,We can't help it! Easy to get knowledge that provides answers to daily problems. Not there when I was a kid.,Neutral
90," Google's unofficial slogal is ""Don't be evil"" but I sometimes think it is evil. They calculate traffic by tracking how fast Android devices are moving on the road.",Fearful
90," They are spying on us, even right now! But they do like dogs, which is pretty good right there.",Neutral
90,And they did hire live goats to mow their lawns once. That is pretty kewl.,Surprised
90,I would become a goat there if it got me stock options.,Neutral
90," Haha. So speaking of Google, I just Googled Borg vs. McEnroe. It is about one of the greatest tennis games ever played. Would you watch it?",Curious to dive deeper
90,I would watch. I don't think I'd bet on the outcome though. Isn't there some movie about them two?,Curious to dive deeper
90,Yes I think that is the title. Shia LaBeouf stars as McEnroe. I am not really too into sports movies.,Curious to dive deeper
90,It's probably mostly about personalities. McEnroe was intense. Borg was Swedish. That's enough personality for one film.,Neutral
90," Haha, hilarious. I will have to check it out!",Surprised
91,Hello!  Are you a tennis fan or do you play?,Happy
91," No, my dad used to, though. It seems like it's too intense for me",Neutral
91,I only tried playing in college to kill time.  I stunk up the courts I was so bad.  The longest tennis match in history went on for over 11 hours and was spread over 2 days.  Crazy.,Happy
91," Was that at one of the big competitions, like an open or Wimbledon?",Curious to dive deeper
91,I'm not sure.  They once had to use a helicopter to dry the grass courts for the 1969 US open.  Bet that dried it fast.,Happy
91,That was the year after the first open when a black player won. But no black player has won since,Neutral
91,Wow.  I didn't know that.  Polo shirts were originally invented by a tennis player and were later adopted by polo players.  Interesting.,Happy
91,So maybe we should really be calling them tennis shirts? Just like sneakers are often called tennis shoes,Neutral
91,lol  Good point!  They say that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes.  I question that... lol,Happy
91,Same. How do people know? How many pairs have survived since then? And what constitutes better performance?,Curious to dive deeper
91,I have no idea.  I bet those would be some smelly shoes though!  They say putting a dry tea bag inside smelly shoes will absorb the unpleasant odor.  I'll have to try that to try that on my smelly stinky shoes. Lol lol,Surprised
91," Oh wow, I never knew that. I actually have a huge problem with that, so that will help. Surprised I didn't learn that when I googled solutions to that problem (which I've done like 100 times)",Surprised
91,I'm a big googler myself.  A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts to the moon. Crazy how far technology has come since then.,Happy
91," I can't even begin to understand how that makes sense. Then again, I guess computing was done a lot by people by hand back in the 60's",Surprised
91,When google went down for 5 minutes in 2013 it took 40 percent of the web traffic with it.  I don't remember that.,Happy
91," I don't remember that either, but it makes sense. Did you know that Google as a company officially prefers dogs over cats?!",Surprised
91,I didn't know that.  I know at one time they used hundreds of live goats to mow the lawns around their headquarters.  They really like their animals.,Happy
91," Yeah! I guess it wasn't too cost effective to do that with the goats, otherwise they'd keep doing it. Pretty energy efficient, though",Neutral
91,I agree!  Good was founded in 1998.  I could have sworn I remember using it before then.,Happy
91,I remember being told about it by a teacher in 1999 or 2000. Like I remember her writing it on the board and another teacher telling us it was an intentional misspelling of the number googol,Neutral
91,Interesting!  I have to get going.  It was nice chatting with you!  Have a good night!,Happy
92," Hello, do you follow tennis?",Curious to dive deeper
92,Not really. I just know each player uses a strung racket and they hit a hollow ball.,Neutral
92,Did you know Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis?,Surprised
92," I did know. I know Lacoste shirts had the crocodile and it was a symbol for Rene ""the crocodile"" lacoste who was a famous player.",Curious to dive deeper
92,Yep. A black man won the first US open tennis title back in 1968 and no black man has won it since.,Surprised
92,Wow! Over 50 years and still holding the record! I think the next year in 1969 they used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the US open.,Surprised
92,I agree. They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US open.,Surprised
92," Yes, they did. The longest tennis match went on for 11 hours over three days. I bet they were exhausted!",Surprised
92,That's crazy long!,Surprised
92,I agree! It's amazing the facts you can find on Google. Did you know that a single Google search requires more computing power than it took to send Neil Armstrong to the moon?,Surprised
92,That's pretty amazing! I saw that Google maps calculates traffic by how fast Android devices are moving on the road.,Surprised
92,I never knew that! I wonder whose? I know I heard that back in the day Google used goats to keep the lawn under control instead of hiring people to mow.,Surprised
92,That's hilarious! Google went down for 5 minutes back in 2013 and took 40% of the web traffic with it.,Surprised
92,I can imagine. I use it a lot. It's hard to believe its only been around since 1998.,Surprised
92," I agree. When there is a dispute on a border, Google maps tailors the map to the claims of each country where the internet browser is located.",Surprised
92,That sounds logical. I wish I would have gotten on board with the 2004 initial public offering to buy stock. I can't even imagine the outcome.,Surprised
92,I can't either. Do you like shoes?,Curious to dive deeper
92,I love shoes!! I know that shoes made 5000 years ago perform better than today's shoes!,Surprised
92,That's pretty amazing they perform better than the shoes of today!,Surprised
92,I agree. I can't see how though. I find it amazing the array of choices like ones that can cost thousands of dollars a pair.,Curious to dive deeper
92,It was good chatting with you!,Happy
93,Hello do you like tennis?,Curious to dive deeper
93,Yes. Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent or doubles.,Happy
93," Yes,  thanks for the explaination.  Did you know that polo shirts were made originally for tennis players?",Curious to dive deeper
93," Yes, It is more comfortable to wear while playing, and it also make the popular of the shirts.",Happy
93,They used a helicopter to dry the grass in the 1969 us open lol,Curious to dive deeper
93," In 19th century, modern tennis is originated in England as Lawn tennis.",Curious to dive deeper
93," Nice,  sounds fun!  The longest tennis match went on for 3 days!  can you imagine?",Curious to dive deeper
93,When this match happened ?,Curious to dive deeper
93,I think around 2015,Curious to dive deeper
93,Thanks. The main component of tennis is racket until 1978 a tennis player was allowed to use absolutely any object as racket.,Curious to dive deeper
93,Thats interesting!,Curious to dive deeper
93,Google was founded in 1998. It is an American multinational technology company that is specialized in internet-related services.,Happy
93,Seems like a long time ago even though it wasnt.,Curious to dive deeper
93," It is the biggest search engine and cloud computing service. It also many application like gmail, youtube, etc...",Happy
93," Yes,  I recently read that a google search requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts to the moon lol",Curious to dive deeper
93,Google is the most valuable brand in 2017. Google announced the new company called Calico.,Curious to dive deeper
93," wow awesome.  Instead of hiring people to mow the lawn,  they hired goats.  ",Curious to dive deeper
93,The company moved to mobile android system the Chrome OS is the light weight operating system.,Curious to dive deeper
93,ok.  I recently read that they calculate the taffic by how fast android phones are moving.,Curious to dive deeper
93,It is very interesting thing. Technology are used to identify were are we. It affect the privacy of person.,Happy
93,I agree.  Its been good chatting.,Curious to dive deeper
94,Do you like tennis? I just love to play the sport.,Happy
94," I've played it a couple time in high school gym class, I wasn't that good",Neutral
94,i love it! Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent or in teams,Happy
94,I watch it sometimes when Serena Williams is playing,Neutral
94," yeah i like to watch her play. Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player rene ""the crocodile"" lacoste. i love their colgne for men",Neutral
94," Intresting, the longest match played in a polo shirt was 22 hours",Neutral
94,yeah if i recall it went over three days or so,Neutral
94," That's a long time, I don't think I've ever done anything for 3 days straight",Surprised
94," im not sure if its true but Us open quarterfinalist gael monfils beat the ""roger federer of paddle tennis"" after learning how to play just days earlier.",Curious to dive deeper
94," Man that's crazy, almost as crazy as using a helicopter to dry grass tennis courts",Surprised
94,yeah i have heard that as well and though it sounded really dangerous. i wonder if their were people in the crowd?,Curious to dive deeper
94," I hope not, if I was there I'd be cold",Neutral
94," yeah. In 1998, serena and venus williams said they could beat any man ranked 200 or worse in a game of tennis. they lost when challenged twice lol",Neutral
94," lol, well she did win the australian open when she was ranked 95th",Neutral
94,i have heard Serena williams is a co-owner of the miami dolphins,Neutral
94," I didn't know that, she speaks french and italian so I wonder if she owns any sports teams in Europe",Curious to dive deeper
94," not sure but In january 2007, serena williams was ranked 95th in the world in tennis",Neutral
94,I never knew she was ever ranked that low,Neutral
94," well she reached the No. 1 ranking for the first time on July 8, 2002 but has since fallen",Neutral
94," Wow, shes so good though, she won a grand slam while pregnant",Surprised
94,I guess in my opinion her and her sister are kinda overated.,Neutral
94," I don't know, maybe",Curious to dive deeper
95," Have you heard of the new ""First Man"" film starring Ryan Gosling?",Curious to dive deeper
95," No, I have not.  Please tell me about it.",Curious to dive deeper
95,It's a space movie.  He plays the character of Neil Armstrong.  It was released Friday.,Curious to dive deeper
95,Did you watch the movie?  Was it really a space movie?,Curious to dive deeper
95,I haven't seen it yet.  Today was the first time I heard of it.,Curious to dive deeper
95,It is hard to talk about this movie if we both have not seen it.  Can we change the topic?,Curious to dive deeper
95,Let's talk about Earth.  It's the third planet from the sun.,Curious to dive deeper
95," Apparently, 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed.  It's depressing to me.",Curious to dive deeper
95,That is sad for sure.  Sad that people are the cause of it too.,Curious to dive deeper
95," When the earth was first formed, there was only 5.5 hours long in a day.  ",Surprised
95,Wow.  I didn't know that.  71 percent of the earth's surface is covered by water.  I wonder what covers the polar regions?,Curious to dive deeper
95," Ice?  I am not sure though.  Apparently, earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century.",Curious to dive deeper
95,Yes.  Ice is right.  It's almost like the history of the earth is like watching a science fiction movie only in real life.,Curious to dive deeper
95," I like science fiction.  I like to imagine things, like aliens in a different planet.",Curious to dive deeper
95,Do you like Starship Troopers?,Happy
95," Yes, because it is the only science fiction novel recommended by three branches of the military.  I wonder why they recommended it though - do you know?",Curious to dive deeper
95,I have no idea.  lol  The word robotics was made up by a book writer - Isaac Asimov.  Seems like robots and space are always a big theme for science fiction books and movies.,Happy
95," By the way, do you know that the United Nations appointed an ambassador to greet extraterrestrials in case they want to say hello to us?",Curious to dive deeper
95," That's interesting!  What a job to have!  That's just like something out of the movie Star Wars, which came out in 1977 and the value of that franchise is now $65 billion dollar! ",Happy
95,Wow.  That is a lot of money.  I heard that it is currently the 5th largest grossing media franchise.,Surprised
95,Initially 20th century fox was convinced that Star Wars was going to be a flop.  Wow we're they wrong.,Surprised
95,They were wrong indeed.  George Lucas got a better deal by forgoing $500k directing fee.,Surprised
95," James Earl Jones only made $7,500 for 2 1/2 hours of work providing the voice for Darth Vader.  Thought he would have spent more time and made more money recording that voice.",Surprised
95,I do not think $7500 is a lot of money to provide Darth Vader's voice because the movie was very successful.  What do you think?,Curious to dive deeper
95,I wonder if the actors get any royalties from the movie?,Surprised
95,They should.  George Lucas should be generous since he got so much money from Star Wars.,Curious to dive deeper
95,You would think!  He's a billionaire from the movie!,Surprised
95,Rich people are often cheap.,Sad
95,That's sad...but so true.  I've seen it too much during my working lifetime where the people at the top get richer and the workers on the factory floor just barely have enough money to live on.,Curious to dive deeper
95," I wonder if someone was fired at fox because of George Lucas deal. Anyway, I've got to run.  Nice chatting with you.",Happy
96,Dogs or cats?,Curious to dive deeper
96," Hi! I have two cats, but want a dog. You?",Curious to dive deeper
96," I like dogs more, but dont mind cats! Google likes dogs more though",Curious to dive deeper
96,Hah. I see their code of conduct state they are a DOG company.,Curious to dive deeper
96," lol, I heard you can bring you dog to work while working there, kind of discriminating against cats though!",Curious to dive deeper
96,Kinda odd since dogs are normally louder and more likely to poop somewhere. Looks like Istanbul even has vending machines to release food and water for strays.,Curious to dive deeper
96," that is a great point! The US needs to get those vending machines, I would donate so many plastic bottles. That is nice of that country",Curious to dive deeper
96,I wonder where else the dogs go if not for vencing machines?,Curious to dive deeper
96," right, they probably go for trash cans unfortunately. Did you know dogs have 12 types of blood?",Curious to dive deeper
96,Makes sense for variety. Apparently they have doggie blood drives too!,Curious to dive deeper
96," that would be so awesome to volunteer at. I will have to look them up. Did you know dogs and elephants are the only animals that respond to pointing, sorry cats",Curious to dive deeper
96," My cats responding to pointing, and throwing.",Curious to dive deeper
96," That is true, so I wonder if there are more we don't know about lol. Do you like horses at all?",Curious to dive deeper
96,I took a horse ride once and live in an area with lots of horses. They are beautiful animals. you?,Curious to dive deeper
96," They are so beautiful, I like petting them but never rode one. I wouldn't ride Icelandic horses because they are super fast.",Curious to dive deeper
96,I wonder if riders trained horses to do that?,Curious to dive deeper
96,I am sure they did. I just wouldn't ride horses to school on no vehicle day and get suspended like two students did. I feel that was pointless,Curious to dive deeper
96,That's funny and rather stupid at the same time.,Curious to dive deeper
96," For sure lol, it was so nice talking with you, say hi to your cats for me!",Curious to dive deeper
96," My cats will run away, but sure!",Curious to dive deeper
96,lol! bye now!,Curious to dive deeper
97,Crazy that early humans used to have to battle giant sloths! Who would've thought?,Surprised
97," I know right! Humans have been around for a long time apparently I mean we lost our body hair 240,000 years ago!",Surprised
97," Yea that's really interesting. I never knew humans could regrow a rib bone that has been surgically shortened, either.",Curious to dive deeper
97,No I didn't know that either. I wonder if other animals can do that? Like can we Harvest Pig ribs for food and then they will regrow that way we don't have to kill the pig haha,Curious to dive deeper
97,That would be awesome! I'm sure science will figure that out someday! We can already use our current technology to date the extinction of ground sloths and determine where ancient human footprints led to.,Curious to dive deeper
97,That's really cool. I would love to see that. They should put that in the movie! I think it's cool that humans are adapted for persistence running. We are some of the best animals in the world at it,Surprised
97,Haha yea that would be cool. That's really surprising humans are the best at persistence running! I wouldn't have guessed that. As long as those pesky hiccups don't attack while running! Darn evolution leftovers!,Curious to dive deeper
97," Haha yep hiccups are so annoying! So is that frequency that causes fear in humans ,have you heard about that LOL?",Curious to dive deeper
97," No, I had not. So fear comes from sound...? I thought it had to do with the autonomic nervous system, fight or flight thing? That would be really interesting to look into further. ",Surprised
97,Can come from sound. And yes I'm going to look into that further as well. Do you like any animals by the way?,Curious to dive deeper
97," I used to own two cats, no current pets though. I would love to go to Japan and play with some cats at a cat cafe though! haha",Curious to dive deeper
97,Haha that does seem like a great idea! Get a drink and pet a cat LOL. Did you know that a cat will spend 10 years of its life sleeping when it's only 15 years old LOL that's a long time,Surprised
97," That is nuts! What I wouldn't give to trade places! Or trade places with Stubbs, the cat who is the mayor of Talkeentna, Alaska! Sounds like a sweet gig.",Curious to dive deeper
97,It does sound awesome! I don't know what kind of work she does but she must be doing a great job lol have you ever seen the movie The Godfather by the way,Curious to dive deeper
97,Right? Haha And yea I've seen the Godfather but it's been a while.,Curious to dive deeper
97," Well in the opening scene the cat that they use, I don't know if you remember that part, but it was actually a stray apparently",Surprised
97," Yea, I vaguely remember, that's awesome. Another sweet gig for a cat! Now if only I woulda thought to have one of my cats coauthor a book with me. I guess some physicist did so so that he could use the first person plural without being criticized!",Curious to dive deeper
97,That is funny! What do you think about Scotland putting a lot in place to protect the Loch Ness monster? Do you think that means he might exist LOL,Curious to dive deeper
97," Haha that is strange. It definitely makes one wonder...maybe the loch ness is some super secret scientific experiment or military weapon? Haha I guess thanks to the Germans, who in 2002 were the first to give animals constitutionally guaranteed legal rights, Scotland can do what it wants concerning the Loch Ness!",Curious to dive deeper
97,The Loch Ness monster should have legal rights to! Did you know that there are 20 quintillion individual animals on planet Earth. I have no idea how many zeros that is but I know it is a lot LOL,Happy
97,Haha that is insane. How does anyone even figure out that there's that many animals?! Interesting that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their forehead. I wonder what that's about?,Curious to dive deeper
97," I know right. like will a fish get a patch of white on its forehead?the only animals that have that that I've ever seen our dogs, so I just don't know LOL",Surprised
98," Hi, Do you like to cook?",Curious to dive deeper
98,I love to cook. just not in july when it is so hot.,Curious to dive deeper
98," Right, it's no fun when it is hot and you're trying to cook. We like to grill a lot outside, which helps not make our home more hot.",Curious to dive deeper
98,Grilling out is the best to help with the heat inside the house. If I have to cook in the house i do it early in the morning before it gets too hot.,Curious to dive deeper
98," Yes that's another great idea. We also sometimes eat out if it is way too hot, or eating something like salads or cereal. Where we aren't using heat at all.",Curious to dive deeper
98,That is a great idea. We tend to eat leftovers too and just use the micorwave.,Neutral
98," The microwave is great and fast, I agree. Making Icecream is a great way to cool down when it gets too hot. We also tend to use box fans.",Curious to dive deeper
98,We use a fan for sure. Also started using like a slow cooker or toaster oven not as hot and now can fit up to a whole chicken.,Happy
98," Great appliances help to cook! We love our air-fryer. Though it tends to eat up the area some, so we open the doors and dim the lights to help with the heat.",Curious to dive deeper
98,I heard some people turn their wrist upside down  to get their blood flowing to stay cool.,Happy
98," Wow great information, I will have to try that sometime. Do you like to eat fish or even go fishing?",Curious to dive deeper
98,I love to fish. the oldest goldfish lived to be 43 years old,Surprised
98," Wow that is a long life for a goldfish! I like to go crabbing too. I heard the seahorse is the only fish with a neck, I",Surprised
98,THere was a koi fish that lived 226 years,Happy
98,Whoa! That is crazy to know and interesting. I know there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.,Surprised
98,Cool the barreleye fish has a transparent head.,Curious to dive deeper
98," Awesome. I heard that saltwater fish dink water through their mouths and through their skin, while a freshwater fish only drinks through their skin. Fish are fascinating.",Surprised
98,That is pretty cool. Do you like to bird watch?,Surprised
98," There are times when i Do like to look at the birds, how about you? Did you know that birds bones are really hollow. So hollow in fact that their skeleton weighs less than their feathers.",Curious to dive deeper
98,thats neat. They have then thousand living species.,Surprised
98," That's cool. Some birds are known to fly from Alaska to mexico without sleeping, that is tiring to think about.",Surprised
98,o wow. I wonder how many days that takes. Scientist say birds have regional accents.,Curious to dive deeper
98," That is cool how they even have accents like humans. My favorite is the hummingbird, they are tiny sometimes about 2 inches long.",Surprised
98,They are the smallest birds and the ostrich is the biggest. Some birds don't fly.,Surprised
98,This reminds me of the extinct dodo bird. They were actually a sub-family of pigeons.,Curious to dive deeper
98,pigeons are one of 3 birds that produce milk for their young.,Surprised
98,Very cool. Pigeons are very pretty birds.,Happy
99,Hi do you like tennis?,Curious to dive deeper
99,Oh yeah! I pick up a racket and hit the net when I can!,Happy
99,Nice!  Did you know that polo shirts were invented for tennis and only later adopted by polo players?,Happy
99," Ha! That's weird! I didn't know that! Tennis has an interesting history. Did you know that until 1978, a tennis player could use any object as a racket?",Surprised
99,Nice!  I wonder if anyone ever tried to use something wacky?  A black man won the 1st US open tennis title in 1968 and no black man has won it since.,Happy
99," Wow! Not since 1968? You know, Serena Williams has increasingly found her voice and spoken out against gender and racial inequality. ",Happy
99," Yes!  Did you know that she speaks fluent French and Italian, as does her sister Venus!",Happy
99," She is truly fascinating! She does it all! She is the first tennis player, male or female, to achieve the career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles. That means she won at least one Australian Open title, French Open title, Wimbledon title, US Open title, and Olympic Gold medal.",Happy
99,That's pretty incredible!  They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US Open.,Happy
99," That's a little before Serena's time! Although, did you know she went pro in tennis at the age of 13?! I could barely even get a ball over the net when I was 13!",Surprised
99,lol  I do remember that.  Both her and her sister brought alot of good publicity to the sport.,Happy
99," That is for sure! Two girls from Compton came and conquered! In total, Serena has been Number 1 for 319 weeks! ",Surprised
99,That is incredible!  The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days.  Wow!,Happy
99,Are you kidding me! Three days?! That's a long time! I don't have that kind of patience! Speaking of long records... did you know the longest point in pro tennis history was a 643 shot rally?,Surprised
99,Wow!  That would have been fun to watch...not so fun for the players. lol,Happy
99," Yeah! It lasted 29 minutes! I bet it was pretty exhilarating, but also probably pretty exhausting! I would certainly be out of breath after 29 minutes!",Surprised
99,lol me too.  Are you a fan of rap music?,Curious to dive deeper
99," Oh yeah! Tennis reminds me a little of rap, since they're both so fast paced. Did you know the world's fastest rapper can rap at a rate of 14.1 syllables per second?",Curious to dive deeper
99,Holy smokes I wouldn't be able to listen that fast!  lol  It's been fun chatting with you!,Happy
99," Then maybe you could try the deaf rapper, Signmark. He rhymes in sign language! You don't have to listen at all! I'm going to go try to find some on the internet. Goodbye!",Neutral
99,I'll have to look him up!  Have a great night!,Happy
100,What do you think of Serena Williams?,Neutral
100,I really like her!,Happy
100,Have you seen the Nike ads?,Neutral
100,I haven't but I hear they are really powerful messages in this age of people stepping forward about sexual harassment.,Neutral
100,It is all about there is no wrong way to be a woman.,Neutral
100," Yes, ans inequality among races and gender. I like Serena.",Neutral
100,I really think she is a great driving force and a good role model to girls.,Neutral
100," Yes, definitely! I agree. She is happy to have such a powerful platform to try and pave the way for upcoming generations. ",Neutral
100,Very true.  Did you now polo shirts were initially invented be a famous tennis player?,Neutral
100,That is interesting! Did you know in Tennis years ago you were allowed to use any object as your racket? Haha,Happy
100," Really, like a shoe?",Neutral
100,Any object! So yes lol....must have been interesting!! As funny as if you grunt...before a shot...it is by some considered to be cheating!,Happy
100," Really, there is so much grunting in tennis.  The longest match was 11 hours long over 3 days!",Neutral
100," Wow, I could never last that long! Speaking of Serena Williams, I didn't know she went pro at age 13! That is amazing....and she is co owner of the Miami Dolphins...wow!",Happy
100," She co-owns the dolphins and was a pro at 13!  Wow, she is really incredible.",Surprised
100,I think she is! Speaking of amazing...imagine this...the worlds fastest rapper can rap 14.1 syllables per second!,Surprised
100," That is crazy, can anyone even understand that?",Neutral
100," I am not sure but I would love to hear it! Talk about funny, McDonald's at one time paid rappers 5 bucks every time they said Big Mac in their songs hahahaa....crazy",Surprised
100,I bet they were dropping Big Mac lines like crazy!,Neutral
100," I bet they were too! lol! There is even a rapper who is deaf! he raps in sign language, very interesting!",Surprised
100," Wow, Id like to watch that.  Great Chat!  Have a great night!",Neutral
101,hi how are you doing over there on that side of the internets,Neutral
101,Hi! Hope you're doing well! So are you a fan of The Walt Disney Company? One of my favorite characters is Minnie Mouse and I was surprised to recently find out her name is short for Minerva Mouse!,Surprised
101,i like disney though i havent watched a disney film in a while. i do like minnie. she is cute as the dickens.,Neutral
101," Well there's actually a hidden subculture dedicated to finding hidden Mickey mouse images in all things Disney, you should definitely check out!",Neutral
101," i guess if you find a mickey, you win something? if i find one, i guess i should tell others and not keep it secret.",Neutral
101," That's a good point! Ha! Unless they change the locations up!  Are you also a fan of Bill Nye? He actually served as a science consultant on Flubber, believe it or not!",Neutral
101,i guess he knows a bit about the science of hypothetical substances. he is an entertaining fellow for sure.,Neutral
101," Indeed he is! I also think it's amazing that Big Hero 6 was rendered with a 55,000 core supercomputer. That is amazing!",Surprised
101,that is astonishing. i wonder how many processors theyll need for big hero 7. i dint see the other big hero movies.,Neutral
101," Probably a lot more than 55,000. Ha! Did you ever see Wall-E? If so, the name is actually a tip of the hat to Walter Elias Disney himself!",Neutral
101,that is cute. i wondered why they pickt such a strange name for a robot but now i see. but he dint have a mustache.,Neutral
101," You're right, I don't think he did! Ha! I'd like to see Wall-E with factual hair like Kanye West's. I bet that'd be funny. Speaking of Kanye, you know he believes aids is man made? ",Neutral
101,yes Kanye is an oddball when it comes to science.,Neutral
101,That is true. But he does do cool stuff every now again like the time he gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at one of his concerts. That was nice of him!,Happy
101,i think that he undersatnds entertainment good but he doesnt have the knowledge for science.,Neutral
101,True. I loved how he did an SNL skit where he mocked himself interrupting award shows ironically two years before he interrupted Taylor Swift at an award show. Ha!,Happy
101,he knew the depths of his depravity and told the whole world first. i think that is honest of him,Neutral
101," Agreed. Since we're on the subject of rap, are you a fan of Tupac. I'm so glad his music is in the library of Congress of cultural significance. He was a talented musician!",Happy
101," Tupac is not my cup of tea but the man could rap the street an urban lullaby. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
101,Indeed he could! I also think Eminem can as well. I'm glad he became a rapper instead of becoming a comic book artist as he wanted to do growing up. Oh what might have been!,Happy
101,he could still DO that! the man has got years in front of him and tales of the street to tell. Have a good one!,Neutral
101," So true. And speaking of Eminem, it's hilarious the judge who was trying a suit against Eminem back in 2001 delivered her ruling in the form of a rap. Glad some judges still have a sense of humor. Ha! Well it was great chatting with you! Take care!",Happy
101,You too! have a good night!,Neutral
101,You have a good evening as well. I'm off to watch the Rugrats movie to see if I recognize Busta Rhymes' voice in it as the Reptar wagon. Ha! Take care!,Happy
102,Disney Land & World released officlal Mickey Mouse ears - rainbow colors - for Pride Month recently. Disney??? When did they wake upd & get tolerant??,Curious to dive deeper
102," Yeah that is interesting. I guess they started that in 2018, it sounds like a lot of people on Twitter were upset too",Surprised
102,About Pride Month or something else?,Surprised
102," I think they were mad that one of the rapper's was supporting president Trump, and they were very happy to hear that Disney was making the LGBT ears or something like that, I don't pay attention to Twitter so I'm not a hundred percent sure",Curious to dive deeper
102," Got it. Yeah, the rapper is Kanye West. Another singer, John Legend, asked West to ""reconsider""",Curious to dive deeper
102," Speaking of Disney, what are you like about their movies? Did you know that for instance Minnie Mouse's real name is Minerva LOL",Surprised
102," Nope. Glad they used the nickname, Minnie. What's your favorite Disney film?",Curious to dive deeper
102," I really like The Little Mermaid and I also like The Lion King, what about you? I don't really like Wall-e myself",Curious to dive deeper
102," Lion King was a fav of mine. Loved James Earl Jones, who voiced the father lion character. Little Mermaid had some great music like ""Under the Sea"". Disney is a huge studio today",Curious to dive deeper
102," Yes I agree with you! I also like the movie Big Hero 6, have you seen it? Apparently it was rendered using a 55000 core supercomputer",Curious to dive deeper
102,Haven't seen. Wonder what that computer looks like - Apple makes a lot of computers used by artists & filmmakers.,Curious to dive deeper
102," Yep you're right about that. Back to Kanye West though, what do you think about him giving a mic to one of his fans in a wheelchair at a concert? That was nice of him",Happy
102," Agree, but calling Trump a ""brother"" went too far. Trump is no bro! Kanye is big music celeb, though.",Curious to dive deeper
102," Yeah, he's definitely an interesting guy, his ideas are not always good though, for instance he thinks that aids is a man-made disease",Happy
102," Heard that. Since when did people create viruses like HIV? West has made a lot of big $$$ producing records, fwith influences from soul, to electro to gospel.",Curious to dive deeper
102," Yes that's a really crazy thing. Kind of like when he mocked himself on SNL for interrupting someone at an awards show, and then did it in real life to Taylor Swift, definitely the guy has some issues",Surprised
102," Think so. His main genre, Rap, is huge, though. Has lots of components, like what is said, rhythm or flow, and tone. Are you a fan of Rap?",Curious to dive deeper
102," Yes I do like rap. I mostly like Tupac Shakur stuff, apparently some of his music is in the Library of Congress actually",Surprised
102,bout time. Some folks say Rap/hip-hop definitely has West African roots - and is based on religious worship.,Curious to dive deeper
102," Yeah I can see that. I would like to see a compliment battle actually, those are really popular in Korea, I think it's a much more positive thing than a diss battle that I usually see",Surprised
102," Great idea. Some rap lyrics don't seem to have anything to do w/praise, do they?",Curious to dive deeper
102," Yes, mostly they are meant to make fun of other people LOL but I think a compliment battle is actually a very smart thing and would promote positivity",Happy
103," Humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago. Do you know ?",Happy
103," That is fascinating, also like the evidence scientists discovered in New Mexico, ancient humans against giant sloths.",Curious to dive deeper
103,Scientists recently found a human print inside a ground sloth's paw marks.,Happy
103," It must be really popular as each year about 500,000 people visit the museum, humans dont stop to amaze me!",Curious to dive deeper
103," NIce! Animals and plants synthesize their own vitamin c, But humans cannot.",Happy
103," That sure is an interesting fact, you know humans can regrow ribs and they will be as strong as before in about 2-3 months",Curious to dive deeper
103," Yes, But there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans.",Happy
103,I bet that frequency is used a lot in horror films.,Curious to dive deeper
103,Yes. Both human and animals are live together. I make our eco-system. The special branch of science to study animals is called zoology.,Happy
103,Its amazing how there are more than 7 million species of animals and there are more to discover.,Curious to dive deeper
103,There are about 20 quintillion animals on planet earth.,Happy
103," Wow, that is a lof animals for sure, you know that animals have constitutional rights in Germany?",Surprised
103," In 1912 Scottish protection of animals act, the loch ness monster is a protected species.",Happy
103," Really? I though the Loch Ness monster was a myth, or maybe its a  safety measure in case they actually discover the monster.",Curious to dive deeper
103,Alaska has had a cat named stubbs as its mayor since 1997.,Happy
103," I wonder how mayor Stubbs makes all the decisions lol, did you watch the movie The Godfather?",Curious to dive deeper
103,There are cat cafes in Japan and Taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks.,Happy
103," Not sure if I would pay for that lol, do you have a cat?",Curious to dive deeper
103," Yes, Its very naughty and its one of family memebers.",Happy
103," I also have a cat, Ive always wondered what breed it is since there are over 70 breeds registered.",Happy
103,Amazing! Its very nice to hear this.,Happy
103," You know the cat in The Godfather, well it was actually a stray cat that happened to be around the set, I bet its life change forever as it is now a movie star.",Curious to dive deeper
104,do you know much about humans?,Curious to dive deeper
104,I know that we lost the body hair only quarter of a million years ago,Curious to dive deeper
104,pretty recent. Do you know why we are good persistence runners?,Curious to dive deeper
104,that is because we used to be hunters and that came in handy,Curious to dive deeper
104,yeah. Did you know we are the only ones that cannot synthesize vitamin c ourselves?,Curious to dive deeper
104,yeah we are missing the enzyme that helps with that,Curious to dive deeper
104,Yeah. Did you know there is a sound frequency that scares us?,Curious to dive deeper
104,I really want to know what that sounds like,Curious to dive deeper
104,Me too. ANd we can regrow ribs if they are surgically removed,Curious to dive deeper
104,yes and in only 2-3 months and just as strong as before,Curious to dive deeper
104,Yeah. Do you know how many individual animals are there?,Curious to dive deeper
104,About 20 quintillion but I have no idea how many zeroes it has,Curious to dive deeper
104,Haha true. Do you have a pet?,Curious to dive deeper
104," I have a dog and two cats, and you?",Curious to dive deeper
104,I have just a dog. Do your pets have white patches in the forehead?,Curious to dive deeper
104," they do not but I hear domesticated animals develop them, weird",Curious to dive deeper
104," Yeah I know  mine do not have them either, confusing a bit",Curious to dive deeper
104,Agreed. DO you know why we have hiccups?,Curious to dive deeper
104,that us from back in the day when animals had gills and lungs,Curious to dive deeper
104,Yeah. Do you know what the Loch Ness Monster is?,Curious to dive deeper
104,Yes that is the believed to be monster in Scotland,Curious to dive deeper
105,Do you like Tennis?,Happy
105," I do not, but I am a fan of Serena Williams, ever since she voiced a character in Avatar; The Last Airbender.",Neutral
105,I didn't know she did that.  She speaks fluent French and Italian.,Happy
105," She's great. There is a rapper who is deaf, and rhymes in sign language.",Curious to dive deeper
105," That is interesting.  Tupac Shakur's music is in the library of congress of ""cultural significance""",Happy
105,Did you know that Serena Williams co-owns the Miami Dolphins?,Curious to dive deeper
105,I didn't know that.  In 2007 she was ranked 95th in the world.,Happy
105," It's hilarious that McDonalds pays rappers $5 for each time they mention big macs in songs. I'm surprised one hasn't just said ""big mac' the entire time.",Surprised
105,lol true!  Big Mac sounds like it would be a good rapper name.  Eminem's true dream was to become a comic book artist before he was a rapper.,Happy
105," Donald Glover's name came from a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. I would have loved to have seen how many he rejected, before settling on ""Childish Gambino"".",Surprised
105," I know right?  Korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle rap called ""compliment battle""  Never heard of that before.",Happy
105," It's fascinating to know that the term ""hip hop"" comes from the 16th century, and means ""to converse"".",Neutral
105,I didn't know that.  In 2001 a Michigan judge delivered a ruling in the form of a rap when judging over a suit filed against Eminem.  I bet that was funny to hear in the court room.,Happy
105,That is funny. It is asinine that grunting can be considered cheating in tennis. How insane is that?,Curious to dive deeper
105,I agree.  It's always so quiet during tennis matches.,Happy
105,I would have liked to have seen the matches when they were permitted to use anything as a racket. I think they ended that in the 70's.,Curious to dive deeper
105,That would have been interesting.  Polo shirts were originally invented bor tennis and later adopted for polo players.,Happy
105," I just admire Serena for speaking up for women's rights, even though it comes at a great personal cost to her. She truly is a warrior for women.",Happy
105,I agree.  In 1998 she shaid that both she and her sister Venus could beat any man ranked 200 or worse.,Happy
105,I have zero ideas how rankings work in tennis. I think it is appalling for a little girl to be told she was too black for tennis whites. That is the epitome of racism right there.,Disgusted
105,You know it!,Happy
106,Hi Do you know that disney has a new line of Mickey ears,Curious to dive deeper
106," AWWW, really? How cute and I would love to get some for my kids. I love Minnie her actually name is Minerva. Cute.",Curious to dive deeper
106,Wall e was given that name to remember walter disney,Surprised
106," How adorable. I never knew that. We are really into the subcultural of finding the hidden mickey mouse image in all things disney, its a fun hobby. ",Curious to dive deeper
106,yeah had seen few videos of the easter eggs of mickey in every production,Happy
106," Oh wow, thats cool. I never heard about that one either. I know Bill Nye was involved with disney, he is a funny scientist. ",Curious to dive deeper
106,for flubber well pretty rare to involve a scientist for a fictional movie. . good move by the team,Surprised
106," Yea, good point. It was a great movie and well done. I havent watched it in a really long time though. Disney changed its name in 1986. They make bold moves.",Curious to dive deeper
106,bold moves  may be a  album with Kanye west would be boldest and unimaginable,Surprised
106," Oh boy, yeah. Kayne West I heard that he believes AIDS is a man made disease. huh?",Curious to dive deeper
106,really ? I think something is wrong with that man,Disgusted
106," Yeah, odd thinking. He also did a skit about interrupting on awards show 2 years prior to really doing it. The skit was on SNL and he was mocking himself.  ",Curious to dive deeper
106,still could not to resist to do it with taylor . Oh boy he truly know about his future may be he was feeling dejavu,Surprised
106," Yeah, good point. Out of the top 10 most successful songs of all time is one of his actually.",Curious to dive deeper
106,pretty much unbelievable may be he should save his talent only for music and avoid talk shows,Neutral
106,Thats some sound advice! His Gold Digger song was really fun to listen to but thats about it.,Happy
106,Do you know that eminem's dream is to become a comic book artist,Curious to dive deeper
106," No way, really? I like him but never knew that. I heard that Tupac has music in the library of congress as cultural significance,. That is pretty cool, I think.",Curious to dive deeper
106,Once a judge gave her ruling in form of Rap where eminem is charged,Surprised
106," HA, thats pretty clever! I guess that Eminem had a favorite character and it was Spiderman. Good thing he stayed with music and rapping.",Curious to dive deeper
106,good chatting with you,Neutral
107,Are you a fan of Disney?,Curious to dive deeper
107," I am, my favorite movie is probably Lion King. What about you?",Curious to dive deeper
107,Lion King rocks! I think they are making a new one really soon. I liked Beauty and the Beast and even Moana was great,Curious to dive deeper
107,I really enjoyed the soundtrack of Moana. Beauty and the Beast also had a pretty good one.,Happy
107,For sure! Did you ever watch Big Hero 6?,Curious to dive deeper
107," I have, it was an excellent movie. What about you?",Happy
107," I liked it a lot, I never knew it was Disney too much while watching it, apparently it was rendered with a 55,000 core supercomputer",Curious to dive deeper
107,Talk about high tech! Bill Nye was a scientist consultant for Disney's flubber!,Surprised
107," no way! That is awesome, I never knew that. lol. Bill Nye is the man!",Curious to dive deeper
107,Pixar also named wall-e after walter elais disney.,Surprised
107," that is a nice shout out to walter disney. I like the other shout outs too, there is a subculture dedicated to finding hidden mickey mouse images in disney things",Curious to dive deeper
107," Speaking of mickey mouse, Minnie mouse was short for Minerva mouse.",Surprised
107," no way, all these short names, I never knew that! I wonder where the name Minerva went",Curious to dive deeper
107,Do you listen to rap music?,Curious to dive deeper
107," I used to love listening to Rap music, not so much anymore, but still enjoy it. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
107,I do not listen to them too much as I prefer other types of music.,Neutral
107," I like Korean Rap, they have compliment rap battles lol",Curious to dive deeper
107," Ah, the infamous k-pop. I have listened to some of that here and there.",Happy
107," Me too, even North Korea has a form of kpop. It was so nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
107,It was nice chatting with you too! Thank you for you time!,Happy
107," Thank you also, enjoy your night!",Curious to dive deeper
108,Hello. Do you like the Star Wars movies?,Neutral
108,I love them! some of my favorites. how about you?,Happy
108,I love them too.  I've even read some of the books and played a few star wars video games.,Neutral
108,oh what games have you played? I used to play a lot of them but the more recent ones havent been great,Curious to dive deeper
108," Some of the older ones. I can't remember the names off the top of my head but one was a race game, where you raced in ships on different planets/tracks.",Neutral
108,oh probably the Episode 1 podracer game. that was a goood one. I cant believe how successful its become after George Lucas made that one movie way back in the 70s,Happy
108," I know.  Hey, did you know that his wife worked on the movie too?  She even won an academy award.",Neutral
108,she did?? what for?,Curious to dive deeper
108," She did some editing work on some scenes.  She worked on obi wan's death, leia's good luck kiss, and the trench run.",Neutral
108,thats awesome. Did you know Ewan McGregors brother goes by Obi-Two?,Happy
108," No I didn't but that's neat!  I don't think I asked, but what games do you or did you play?",Neutral
108," I played the old Super Star Wars games on the SNES, and Knights of the Old Republic on Xbox. Those games were awesome",Happy
108," Those sound familiar.  Yeah, the older games and movies were better.  Speaking of older, i heard that James Earl Jones only spent a little over two hours recording his Darth Vadar lines and he was paid $7500.  I imagine he'd make a lot more if he were doing that today.",Neutral
108,he probably would make no less than 100k a day! that voice is so iconic,Surprised
108,It really is.  The Force Awakens movie just didn't do him or Vader justice in my opinion.,Neutral
108,you see I liked Force Awakens a lot. I like Kylo Ren. its a different spin because he conflicted and not just all big bad and evil,Neutral
108," Okay, I got my new movies mixed up. I liked kylo ren too. What I didn't like is seeing Hans Solo die if that's the right movie. The one  I meant about vadar was the new movie about a young darth vadar.",Neutral
108,oh yea Han died in Force Awakens. did you know Star Wars is technically responsible for Titanic and Avatar existing?,Surprised
108,No I didn't. How is that?,Neutral
108," James Cameron decided to join the film industry after watching star wars, he drected those 2 films",Happy
108,I guess Star Wars is inspiring in more ways than one!,Neutral
109,Hey there what do you think about planet Earth? It's amazing that Earth has only one natural satellite aka the Moon,Curious to dive deeper
109," Oh, really? That is really interesting.",Happy
109," It is interesting, but something that's sad is that four-fifths of the world's natural forests have been destroyed. We need to do better with the planet I think",Sad
109," I think so too. I can't believe when the earth was first formed, one day was 5.5 hours long!",Surprised
109,I know right! do you think that days are getting longer overtime? Like will we have a 40 hour day at some point in the future,Curious to dive deeper
109," I'm not sure, but I hope not, that is way too long!",Happy
109," What do you think about the United Nations appointing an ambassador to extraterrestrials? I wonder what he does all day, sounds like the most boring job in the world because obviously we haven't had contact yet",Curious to dive deeper
109," It must be very boring. If we ever do have contact, I wonder if they would tell us?",Happy
109," That's a good point! Scary thing about our current trajectory is that Earth will be out of helium by the year 2100, I know that you love him very important for manufacturing things so I don't know what we'll do",Fearful
109," It's very scary to think about, hopefully we don't.",Happy
109," What other interesting fact, is that if all of history was 24 hours, humans would only take up about 1 minute worth of the 24 hours, isn't that wild to think about?",Surprised
109,It's very interesting. It's amazing how long the earth has sustained life.,Happy
109,Yes Earth has been around for a long time for sure. So interesting to me is that Earth is about 71% covered with water. The other 29% is land and various Islands.,Surprised
109," Yeah, I found that out a few years ago, there is so much ocean that hasn't been explored. Can you imagine what is in there?",Happy
109,I know right! I always wanted to go treasure hunting and get some gold from like sunken ships or something haha. Do you like science fiction by the way?,Curious to dive deeper
109,I think it's great to learn about.,Happy
109," Yes I think it's interesting, one cool thing to is that NASA has a list of space technology words that writers can use so that they are making accurate statements in the movie",Surprised
109,That is awesome! I seen something about starship troopers is the only science fiction novel that is used by three of the five branches in the us military.,Happy
109," Yep you're right! Have you seen the movie? The movie is really violent but I liked it, it's from the director of Robocop. I can't believe it's on the military reading list though",Surprised
109," Yeah me either! A judge in 1950's tried to ban science fiction comics. Get this, because there was a black character! ",Happy
109," Yeah that's horrible! interesting that the term ""robotic"" was created by a science fiction author, you'd think that it would have been an actual science term, and this happened back in 1941 haha",Surprised
109," I know right! haha, well it was nice talking to you, I've got to fix dinner now. Bye! :)",Happy
110," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
110," Great! Did you know that Oscar Isaac requested that his character in The Force Awakens be from Yavin 4, because he's from Guatemala and that's where the Yavin 4 scenes were shot in the original trilogy?",Happy
110,I did not know that! I was also shocked to learn that George Lucas's wife won an emmy while he did not.,Surprised
110," Huh, he didn't win an Emmy for the Star War Christmas special? Haha. In 2013 Star Wars was the first film to be dubbed into a Native American language -- Navajo. ",Happy
110,I find it sad that this was not done until 2013. Don't you think it should have been earlier than that?,Surprised
110," You would think. It is sad. For the original Star Wars movie, James Earl jones only got paid $7500 and recorded all of his lines in just 2 and a half hours. Talk about a bargain. ",Happy
110,Yeah! That does work out to a great hourly rate though. The total value of the star wars franchise is $65B!,Surprised
110," And that's after they studio thought it was going to flop, so Lucas gave up his $500k directing fee in return for licensing and merchandising rights. Maybe one of the best business decisions ever made!",Happy
110,Yeah! Do you know what he sold to Disney for? How much???,Curious to dive deeper
110," Seems like it was over a billion. Back to Lucas's wife -- she had a lot of the best ideas for the original movie, like Obi Wan's death. ",Happy
110,I cried when I saw that part. Still makes me sad. She also suggested Leia's good luck kiss...,Happy
110,And re-edited the trench run scene to make it more suspenseful. Those are some big contributions. Much deserving of the editing Oscar.,Happy
110," I agree. I think star wars is getting too watered down, with average movies like Solo and New Hope. They were ok movies but not up to the quality we have come to know about the franchise.",Sad
110,Totally agree. I did LOVE the spin-off Rogue One though from 2016. That one felt like a true Star Wars movie from back i the day.,Happy
110,I did like that one. I thought that had a good story and nice acting. There's a reason why they are the most successful film merchandising franchise!,Happy
110,Definitely. I also like the diversity of the films. Did you know in the 1950's a judge tried to ban a sci-fi comic because one of the characters was black? Crazy.,Happy
110,Very unfair. Isn't (s)he supposed to be just? Weighing the decisions of the land so that everyone is treated fairly?,Disgusted
110," The 50's were a different time, unfortunately. One of the first sci-fi stories is thought to be from ancient Greece, over 1800 years ago, about plant-based aliens living on the moon.",Happy
110,Who thinks of these stories? I guess it is more of a commentary on my lack of creativity.,Surprised
110,Haha. Isaac Asimov coined the term Robots in 1941. I'd have thought it was much older than that.,Happy
110,Yeah. That seems young. Nice chatting with you!,Happy
111," hi, did you watch the movie titanic?",Curious to dive deeper
111," Yes, I watched the movie several times and for me it was touching.",Curious to dive deeper
111,Yes it always is. did you know the founder of Hershey was going to be in the ship but had to cancel due to work,Curious to dive deeper
111," No, I didn't know that, are you aware if or not the titanic was found in real life?",Curious to dive deeper
111,Yeah and there are even picture of the iceberg that sunk the titanic,Curious to dive deeper
111," Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorite actor, do you have a favorite actor?",Curious to dive deeper
111,I do not think I have a favorite one but he was soo good in the titanic,Curious to dive deeper
111," If you had to bucket list, what will be number on your bucket list?",Curious to dive deeper
111,travel the world and explore as many countries as possible . and you?,Happy
111," About the same travel the world, visit places that I have never visit before, no matter how far.",Surprised
111,yeah that would be incredible. d o you like dogs?,Curious to dive deeper
111," Yes, I like dogs, I have a german shepard, but I also will like to have a husky if I live in the mountains.",Curious to dive deeper
111,That is really nice. they can have one of the 12 types of blood,Curious to dive deeper
111," Do you have a dog, If yes what breed of dog and his name?",Curious to dive deeper
111,I do not unfortunately for now. Maybe later. Dogs can also donate blood that is so cool,Curious to dive deeper
111," Wow, that is cool, do you know any of your personal friend's dog that donated blood?",Surprised
111," No, none that I know. In Istanbul they have vendin machines that dispense food and water for dogs",Curious to dive deeper
111," Ok, do you like horse, If you do, have you rode a horse before?",Curious to dive deeper
111,I have ridden a horse before and they are my favorite animals. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
111," Yes, I rod a once, I was raised on a farm and all my friends had a horse except me.",Happy
111,THey are such gentle creatures. Nice chatting with you.,Happy
112,Do you watch the Red Sox?,Curious to dive deeper
112," I do, what do you think about Prices injury?",Curious to dive deeper
112," It sucks that he is injured, a friend of mine had the same problem from typing on the computer.",Curious to dive deeper
112," Yeah I guess carpal tunnel is a pretty common injury, it seems like his problem is related to gaming",Curious to dive deeper
112," Yeah, I guess that is better than Tommy John problems. ",Curious to dive deeper
112," Well the team manager must be really mad, after all David is one of the key pieces of the team, he said his been playing for a while now, since he was 12 so I wonder if playing games is really the cause",Curious to dive deeper
112," Yeah, he is a great player. Did you know video games were orignally used by the military? ",Curious to dive deeper
112," No I didnt, I always thought they were used for entertainment although I know the millitary use them currently",Curious to dive deeper
112," I know, it was probably for some type of war game. ",Curious to dive deeper
112,What are your thoughts on the name ''Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Devices'' ?,Curious to dive deeper
112,I play them every now and then. LOL,Curious to dive deeper
112," I think its a really long and boring name lol, I do like to play video games as well do you have a PlayStation system?",Curious to dive deeper
112," No, I used to though. I didn't like the games that were coming out on it. ",Curious to dive deeper
112," I see well I bought one and used to play fifa 14, that was the last game that came our for the PlayStation 2 model.",Curious to dive deeper
112,I used to play that too. Did you Tom Hanks brother does woody's voice in video games?,Curious to dive deeper
112," I didnt, he has a great voice! you know that Stephen Fry is also a game narrator, he narrater the voice for some games",Curious to dive deeper
112," Yeah, I heard that. Apparently playstation 3s are being used to research blackholes. ",Curious to dive deeper
112," Wow it sounds like the consol has a lot of power, it must be cheaper than building a computer capable of doing that, the department of defense also used them to build a supercomputer, in fact 1760 units",Curious to dive deeper
112," yeah, apparently they used them to build a super computer, I wonder if they were actually playing grand theft auto!",Curious to dive deeper
112," I dont about that but something funny happened to the company, they issued and unlock code for the ps3 by accident, they were prosecuting people that did the same things before them.",Curious to dive deeper
112," Wow, did you ever try any of the baseball games on playstation?",Curious to dive deeper
112," I did, but I rather watch the games than to play them on a video game console, do you like baseball?",Curious to dive deeper
112," Yeah, me too. I like baseball a lot, I played when I was younger. ",Curious to dive deeper
113,Hello! How are you today?,Curious to dive deeper
113," Hello, I'm great thanks for asking. Do you like video games?",Curious to dive deeper
113," I do! I've been playing for over 20 years now, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
113,I have been playing for about 25 years now. I saw video games were originally called cathode ray tube amusement devices.,Surprised
113,Say that ten times fast haha. Did you know it is illegal for kids 16 and under to play video games past midnight?,Curious to dive deeper
113," Haha. I did not know that, but maybe that's a good idea. ",Surprised
113,I agree. Do you have a playstation or xbox?,Curious to dive deeper
113,I have a PS4. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
113,I have an xbox. I wonder when the playstation came out?,Curious to dive deeper
113,I love Sony so I've always stuck with Playstation.,Neutral
113,I had the playstation and playstation 2 but then jumped to xbox. I think it's cool the military uses playstation 3's to build a supercomputer.,Curious to dive deeper
113,That is very cool. They are super powerful devices so it makes sense to me.,Surprised
113,Do you like to watch baseball at all?,Surprised
113,I love baseball. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
113,Same here. I didn't know it was more popular in Japan than it is here!,Curious to dive deeper
113,Me either. It's a huge past time here in America. I'm excited for opening day.,Surprised
113,Who do you like to watch?,Curious to dive deeper
113,I love the Cincinnati Reds. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
113," I'm not a fan of a team but like watching it in general! Anyways, Great chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
113,I think the same. It was good talking to you too!,Happy
113,Have a great day!,Curious to dive deeper
114,Hello. Do you play any video games?,Happy
114,I do play games.  I enjoy the call of duty game series.,Neutral
114,I also enjoy that game. Did you know video games were initially called cathode ray tube amusement devices and were used by the military?,Neutral
114," Yes, cathode ray tubes have come and gone and the game plays on.  I have a Playstation 3, but no plans to upgrade.  ",Happy
114,I have a ps3 as well. I dont see the point to buying a ps4. This one is all I need as well.,Neutral
114," The game Destiny turned me off gaming.  It was fun to play, but it demands network connectivity.  Sometimes the old games are just fun.  Donkey Kong and Mario are still OK.  I see Fifa 14 works on PS2, PS3 and PS4.",Neutral
114,I was never into soccer games. I liked Madden though. Did you know that ps3s are being used to research black holes.,Surprised
114," Yes, people let them run and they network together.  Sort of like the 1760 PS3's used by the department of defense to make a super computer.  Never tried Madden.",Happy
114,Never played madden. You will have to try it. How about grand theft auto. Have you played that one?,Happy
114,I do indeed love GTA.  I want to say that I played early rev levels on a PC.  It was a different game back then. FUDGE RIPPLE!  I will search for a disk and see if it is audio.,Happy
114,THe original game when played in a cd player would play the soundtrack to the game.,Happy
114,Interesting.  Have you ever had carpel tunnel syndrome brought on by playing games?,Neutral
114,Actually I have. I dont know if that is why I got it though. I was typing a lot for work when I got it.,Happy
114," Yes, it can be a big deal.  Imagine a Major League Baseball player missing games because of carpel tunnel.  LOL.",Happy
114,I can imagine it. It really is painful. Did you know that baseball managers wear a uniform because they are allowed to play if needed?,Happy
114," Haha.  Imagine if your boss could sit in for you at work.  He would be steamed if you said, ""I have a Fortnite related injury and must sit this out."" ",Neutral
114,He would be steamed and I would be totally embarrassed. Lol. Did you ever play soccer baseball. That's what Canadians call kickball.,Happy
114,Kickball on the playground. What fun.  David Price is the MLB player with a 217 million dollar seven year contract.  Cant play ball games.  Perhaps because of video games. He might try kick ball.,Neutral
114,Maybe he should. What did you think about that guy findin 3 million dollars worth of old baseball cards in his grandpas attic.,Happy
114,Finding 3 million dollars worth is like finding an unlock code for life.,Neutral
114,It wouldn't guarantee you win the game but it would sure make it a lot easier. Lol. Have a great day.,Neutral
114,Have a good day.,Neutral
115,hey there do you watch any shows on Netflix,Curious to dive deeper
115," Yes I have a subscription, been watching The Office.  They have come out with their own originals too called Netflix Original.  What about you?",Curious to dive deeper
115," oh ya I love stranger things and other shows they have, I do the digital though not with dvds",Curious to dive deeper
115," Oh no I don't do DVDs either just the streaming service.  It's too bad it doesn't have Game of Thrones though, that show has gotten 37 emmy awards.",Neutral
115,I do like GOT! George RR Martin is the author and a genius!,Happy
115,It is such a hit parents are naming their kids Arya.  Only a couple more months until the last season starts.,Neutral
115," ya I can't wait, weird that charlie Chaplins granddaughter is in the show too!",Surprised
115," Wonder if they ever offered Tom Cruise a part, he has won so many awards for best actor, they probably can't afford him.",Surprised
115," ya, he is a great actor though, so many classic roles like Maverick in Top gun and Ron Kovic in Born on the Fourth of July",Happy
115,Yeah I really like him in The Last Samurai.  He spend time learning Japanese and swordplay on this own to prepare for the role.  Good on him.,Happy
115," yup I like that movie, I never realized samurai was plural and refers to the whole group and not just Tom Cruise haha",Surprised
115," I liked him in Rainman too, that movie won Best Picture.  I think one of my favorites is when he plays a hitman in Collateral with Jamie Foxx.",Happy
115," oh ya that is a really good movie, he is kind of looney though he spent 10 million dollars to build a bunker to protect himself from aliens",Surprised
115,Yeah I think he is into Scientology. Did you know he was married to Nicole Kidman? They have since divorced.  Though they did so Eyes Wide Shut together.,Sad
115," lol, that is a weird movie though, Seinfeld is super rich though, richer than Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise combined apparently ",Surprised
115,Well I am just glad I do not have any stock in MoviePass.  It fell to under a dollar after people found out Christopher Robin was not being shown last summer.,Surprised
115," oh wow ya I'm glad I didn't get that, I just use Netflix and thats enough for me",Happy
115," Netflix is piling up debt to fund all these new series and shows, 21.9 billion at last count.  But they have made 125+ shows and series of new content.",Surprised
115," ah I didn't know that, they sure take up a lot of bandwidth, about 1/3 of all internet traffic",Surprised
115,I bet Blockbuster regrets not buying them for 50 million.  Now they are out of business or pretty close.,Surprised
115," ya, with Netflix now worth about 2 billion, that was definitely a mistake!",Surprised
116," Hello, are you a big Netflix person?",Curious to dive deeper
116,I am!  I have been a subscriber for years and especially love the original content!,Happy
116,I do as well! Were you a subscriber even back when their whole business model was about DVD rental by mail and not an online platform?,Curious to dive deeper
116,I was! I think it was in 2007 when they started adding streaming features.,Happy
116," It's interesting to think how differently the company could have been if decisions played out differently. Like Blockbuster declining to buy them many times, and now they're worth many times over.",Neutral
116,Exactly! A purchase of $50 million that is now worth $2 billion. That is just CRAZY!,Neutral
116,And I feel like that doesn't even big to desribe how huge Netflix is still. Netflix accounts for a third of ALL bandwith in North America from 9pm to 12 am!,Surprised
116," Which is honestly just nuts. And when you combine Netflix and youtube, it's half of the peak internet traffic in North America alone!",Surprised
116," I was surprised to learn recently though, that despite how huge their online platform is, they still do DVD rentals! And spend 20 times more on postage than their bandwith.",Surprised
116,True - but I think they might need to start paying more attention to what they are spending - they racked up $21.9 billion in debt as of Sept 2017 trying to get content!,Surprised
116," That's certainly a lot of money! Although at least it's an investment and will come back to them. On the other hand, I remember a decade ago, Tom Cruise spent $10 million on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens, what a nut.",Neutral
116," I stopped liking him when he went all about Scientology. I much prefer other actors now, like Peter Dinklage.",Neutral
116," I've never heard of him, does he do a lot of action movies? I like Tom Cruise because of movies like Top Gun and Cocktail but I'm always interested in expanding my preferences.",Curious to dive deeper
116," Actually, Peter Dinklage plays Tyrion Lannister on Game of Thrones! ",Happy
116," Oh wow! That's a beautiful show I've been meaning to watch, it's filmed in Ireland I think! And from the limited parts I've seen the scenery is gorgeous.",Happy
116,Yes. It is my most favorite show - which it definitely has earned with all of its Emmys - 47 to be exact!,Happy
116," That's a whole lot! They're certainly influential, I read somewhere that Arya is the fastest rising baby name for girls in the US, due to a character from the Game of Thrones.",Neutral
116," My daughter is named Arya. So we definitely fell into the trend! I am sad it is going to end this year, with the last season starting in April.",Sad
116," Oh wow that's very cool! Hey at least if you ever want to pick up a new show after, Nat Geo Wild has a show that parodies Game of Thrones but follows lions!",Happy
116,I heard about that! I think that would be awesome - following them like the characters in the show!,Surprised
116," Yeah absolutely, regardless it will be cool to see if Netflix can makea similar show themselves after Game of Thrones ends. Anyways it was nice chatting with you, have a good day!",Curious to dive deeper
117," Hello, do you watch Netflix?",Curious to dive deeper
117," Hi there, I do sometimes, but don't have an account myself.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
117," I do have an account. Did you know from 9pm-12am, Netflix accounts for 33% of all the bandwidth in North America?",Surprised
117," Holy cow, that is so much bandwidth during those peak hours. ",Curious to dive deeper
117,I agree. Netflix and YouTube make up half of the peak internet traffic in North America.,Surprised
117," That is crazy, and I think it will even continue to grow in the future. ",Curious to dive deeper
117,Netflix is worth $2 billion right now.,Surprised
117," Wow, I think back in 2000, they proposed to Blockbuster that it should use Netflix as it's online service, they laughed at the offer. ",Curious to dive deeper
117,I bet lol. Netflix was started due to a $40 late fee incurred by Reed Hastings.,Surprised
117," Yeah old Reed didn't like those late fees, look what happened since then. ",Curious to dive deeper
117,Do you like Tom Cruise?,Curious to dive deeper
117," Yeah I do, I really like 80's Tom Cruise movies.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
117,Me too. I love Top Gun.,Happy
117," Yeah Top Gun was one of his best for sure, I always like risky business. ",Curious to dive deeper
117,Tom Cruise once threatened Tom Kruse who is the inventory of the hoverboard.,Surprised
117,I heard that!  I think he should have just endorsed it and gone along with it.,Curious to dive deeper
117,I agree. Tom Cruise spent two years learning Japanese and swordplay in preparation for a film.,Surprised
117," That is dedication, I have always admired him for his acting skills. ",Curious to dive deeper
117,Me too. He has a $10 million dollar underground bunker to protect himself from aliens.,Surprised
117," That is the weird side of him, I remember when he went kind of nuts on the Ellen show years back. ",Curious to dive deeper
117,It was great chatting.,Happy
118,Did you know the china wall was very large and famous in the world.,Happy
118,I did know that. I think I saw a movie about that on Netflix actually. Do you have Netflix,Curious to dive deeper
118," Yes, i have Netflix. Netflix was founded in 1997.",Curious to dive deeper
118,Yep it's crazy that they're going to spend it 2 billion dollars this year to make more new content. I do like their shows though,Surprised
118,Netflix tv shows are awesome. And Netflix founder was reed hastings and marc.,Curious to dive deeper
118,Yep he started it because he was mad about the late fee for his movie Apollo 13 haha that is actually really good movie have you ever seen it,Curious to dive deeper
118,I saw that movie. I think the movie was released in 1970.,Curious to dive deeper
118,I think it was actually in the nineties I think you're thinking of the wrong one haha. Apollo 13 head Tom Hanks in it. What do you think about Tom Cruise though,Curious to dive deeper
118,I love tom cruise and his movies. It was awesome. mission impossible movie was so great.,Happy
118,Yep I like Mission Impossible II. I also like The Color of Money in the movie Cocktail. Eyes Wide Shut was pretty weird though haha,Happy
118,tom cruise edge of tomorrow movie was awesome. edge of tomorrow directer has a great mind.,Happy
118,It's crazy that Tom Cruise spent two years learning Japanese and how to use a samurai sword to prepare for the movie The Last Samurai. Personally I didn't really like that movie what did you think,Curious to dive deeper
118,Tom cruise was great actor and hard worker. He spend a lot of to learn a japanese language.,Happy
118," Yeah for sure. I also never knew that in the movie, The Last Samurai, Samurai is actually plural and refers to Tom Cruise and the whole clan",Surprised
118,I think the movie was released in 2003 and the movie was successfully crossed 45-68 crores usd.,Curious to dive deeper
118," I always think the Tom Cruise is super rich, but Seinfeld has a net worth that is more than Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks combined which is insane",Surprised
118,Tom hanks also great actor and his net work is $390 million.,Curious to dive deeper
118,He has a great actor. Tom Cruise is kind of a weird guy though. He spent $10 on a bunker to protect himself from outer space aliens,Surprised
118,It's great but i don't know.,Surprised
118," Do you ever watch Game of Thrones? I love that show, it has won a bunch of awards",Curious to dive deeper
118,I watch all 7 seasons. it's all are good.,Happy
118,Yeah I love them. And I didn't know that Arya is the fastest growing baby girl name in the United States period that is definitely due to Game of Thrones,Surprised
119,good morning to you,Happy
119,Good morning! Are a fan of The Simpsons? Fox News once tried to sue to get the show to stop parodying them.,Happy
119," I love the Simpsons! not so much Fox news though, they deserve to parodied",Neutral
119," They practically ARE a parody! Do you remember their version of the Daily show from 2007? Man, it was terrible. Really, really terrible. It was canceled after 13 episodes. ",Happy
119,with Jon Stewart? the one on Comedy Central?,Curious to dive deeper
119," Yeah, fox tried to copy it with their own show called the Half Hour News Hour. ",Happy
119,oh I thought you were saying The Daily Show was bad and got cancelled! yea Fox should not have copied that show. Did you know Fox News and IGN are owned by the same company?,Neutral
119,I did not know that. But I'm sure Rupert Murdoch owns dozens of companies I don't know about. Another thing I didn't know -- Hillary Clinton was the president of the You ng Republicans in college.,Happy
119," wow! her views sure have shifted a lot since then, huh/",Neutral
119," I'd say. Nixon actually proposed a guaranteed minimum wage, the only president to ever do so. ",Happy
119," which surprises me , I always thought that that was something that pretty much everyone had touched upon in their time in office at least a little bit",Surprised
119," Yeah, I was surprised too. Another surprising fact: Tea Party/GOP poster child Ayn Rand was on Social Security and Medicare. ",Surprised
119," wow. I never cared for her books, did you?",Surprised
119,No. Couldn't even finish the one I started. Canada's first official currency was playing cards! Now that's cool.,Happy
119,sometimes i wish they still used stuff like that! id be rich! haha,Neutral
119," Haha. Hawaii passed single payer healthcare in 2009, but the governor wouldn't sign it into law. If only the rest of the country would follow suit - and then pass it into law. ",Happy
119," yea I wish we had single payer, my health insurance is so complicated sometimes. people shouldnt go broke over a doctor visit",Neutral
119," Totally agree. It's ridiculous that we don't haver it in this country. Someday, I think. Hopefully. ",Angry
119,Some candidates are pushing for it! sadly those guys dont win office,Neutral
119," Yeah. In Kentucky, you can't take office if you've ever participated in a duel. Maybe that's what we need more of in politics today -- duels. ",Happy
119,imagine that? haha duels in court would be hilarious,Neutral
120,Do you like Taylor Swift?,Curious to dive deeper
120,I liked her country stuff and some of her earlier pop. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
120," I do like her, specially her performance of the Reputation tour she had in Glendale. AZ",Curious to dive deeper
120,It seems like she and Kanye West have perpetual conflicts of one sort or the other.  First he crashed her award acceptance.  Then she is accused of stealing his music.  Social media was not kind to her over that accusation!,Curious to dive deeper
120," I think they were a bit unfair to her, it must be hard to be a celebrity, specially a really famous one like her",Curious to dive deeper
120," Well, they called her a ""snake"".  I like the way she turned it into a positive in her concert with imagery, a snake microphone, and a snake platform.  Snakes in general have an unwarranted bad reputation.  Do you have any experience with snakes?",Curious to dive deeper
120," No not really, but I love them many people are scared of them but I think they are interesting animals",Happy
120," I live in a rural area, so snakes are not uncommon.  I have a 4-5 foot common garter snake nesting at the base of my fig trees.  I like there because she eats the field mice and other critters who want my figs.  Too many people automatically assume snakes are poisonous.  Did you know that only in Australia do venomous snakes outnumber non-venomous ones?",Curious to dive deeper
120," I didnt know that about Australia, are you afraid of snakes? with what you told me previously I bet you are not afraid of them",Curious to dive deeper
120," No.  I let them go on their way and I go one mine.  While we do have coral snakes, water moccasins, rattle snakes, I have never been bitten.  Did you know that one man has been bitten so often that the antigens in his blood allow it to be used an anti-venom?",Curious to dive deeper
120," Really? I guess he made a valuable contribution to science and also to medicine, did you hear of that species of flying snakes",Curious to dive deeper
120," I had not, but I could see it possible to approximate flying.  I know they can climb trees because I see the garter snake in my fig trees.  I guess if she wanted to, she could coil and spring, flinging herself from one tree to another.  Down here, Mardi Gras ended last night.   My ears are still ringing from the concerts put on by local bands.  Did you know that a Fighter Concert was so loud that it was picked up on New Zealand seismic (earthquake) monitors?",Curious to dive deeper
120," I didnt know that, do you have any favorite bands? used to like Linking Park",Curious to dive deeper
120," When I lived in Viginia, I liked Dave Matthews when he was starting out in Charlottesville.  Did you know that a woman driving to a Dave Matthews concert picked up a stranded bicyclist who was Dave Matthews himself!",Curious to dive deeper
120," Wow, that is amazing, I mean what are the ods, that woman is really lucky, I bet she went crazy in that moment.",Surprised
120," I would think so.  I have not been to an major act indoor concert since my high school and college days in the 1970s and the 1980s.  Back then Deep Purple broke the record for the loudest concert ever that rendered 3 people unconscious.  While rendering 3 people unconscious is alarming, I wonder how many people had lifelong hearing damage after that one?",Surprised
120," I bet at least a few of them did, a really bad concert was the one the band Creed gave in 2002, the concert was so bad the band even got sued by some of the concert goers",Curious to dive deeper
120," Well, Creed survived that one to become a major rock act in the early 2000s.  Do you know if Taylor Swift is still on the ""Reputation"" concert tour or has that wrapped up?",Curious to dive deeper
120," I guess its all wrapped up by now, I think this article is a bit old, I think that tour happened around 2016 so yeah.",Curious to dive deeper
120," I glad her reputation survived from the Kanye West feud.  While I not much of a fan of her current music, she is a talented artist.  She also is quite a philanthropist.  Did you know she donated all proceeds from ""Wildest Dream"" song to African wildlife conservation?",Curious to dive deeper
120," No, I didn't know about that, seems like she has a great great, I will follow her example from now on, anyways it's been cool to chat, thanks for all the facts and knowledge",Curious to dive deeper
120," Well, its time to start cycling to work.  Nice chatting with you.",Neutral
120," That will do some favors to the enviroment for sure, nice chatting, have a nice day. ",Curious to dive deeper
121,Do you like snakes?,Curious to dive deeper
121," they are kind of gross to me, but do you like them?",Curious to dive deeper
121," Yeah there history is strange. Apparently there is a lizard with no legs and i always though that was what a snake was, lol. ",Curious to dive deeper
121," really? I wonder what separates the two from each other then, i have to imagine they look very similar",Curious to dive deeper
121," You would think but that's not what they pay me for, ha. Maybe we should move to new zealand they don't have snakes there.",Curious to dive deeper
121," i agree, snakes are so creepy, they are a very lucky country in my opinion",Curious to dive deeper
121,Mine too. Apparently fear of snakes is hard wired into our brains and monkeys.,Curious to dive deeper
121,maybe it is because of the way that they move or the noises that they make? I cannot think of why that may be the case,Curious to dive deeper
121,Me either. Do you know who Taylor Swift is?,Curious to dive deeper
121," I do, I am a big fan of her music!",Curious to dive deeper
121,she was born on December 13 1989. one of her albums won 4 grammy's.,Curious to dive deeper
121," she is very successful, she also owns a private jet, she is doing very well for herself",Curious to dive deeper
121,Yes she is and to be so young it's great! that jet is a Falcon 900 and cost 40 million right? Those are really nice.,Curious to dive deeper
121," yes, that is more than I will see in my lifetime, but I am glad she was able to make so much in her career before she loses popularity",Curious to dive deeper
121,Well hopefully she did well with the money she made so far because fame don't last forever.,Curious to dive deeper
121," that is true, she knows her stuff, she took her music off spotify so it was not free, she is kind of money minded",Curious to dive deeper
121," Well that's good. Apparently she accidentally released 8 seconds of white noise and topped Canadian itunes charts, lol.",Curious to dive deeper
121," that is insane, just imagine being that popular, most people never even see that much success",Curious to dive deeper
121,Right! Her walking backward to avoid picture taking is a ;little weird though.,Curious to dive deeper
121," i guess i sort of get that, it must be annoying being public so often",Curious to dive deeper
121,I can't even imagine. Nice chatting with you!,Curious to dive deeper
122," Where do you source your news? Fox, Cnn, other?",Neutral
122,Mostly other. Certainly not Fox.,Curious to dive deeper
122,Did you know that CNN recently raised concern about Fox & Friends?,Neutral
122,I had heard something about it. Weren't they concerned about their interviews with Republicans?,Curious to dive deeper
122," Yes you are correct. Despite the students mourning due to a mass shooting a day earlier, Republicans appeared only a fox where they wouldn't be pressed about gun control",Neutral
122,That's terrible. All of our press should be able to question our representatives. I think some of the people they interviewed were Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz if I remember correctly.,Curious to dive deeper
122,All they mentioned was that it was a truly heart breaking horror and that evil is sadly always present.,Angry
122,We should have known it's bias since it was created by a Republican media strategist and Richard Nixon.,Curious to dive deeper
122,I feel that most news are bias in some way or another. Too bad fox is watched more than cnn and msnbc combined.,Sad
122,That's sad. Apparently they even threatened to sue the Simpsons for making fun of them for their anti-democratic agenda. They wanted to stop them from continuing that.,Curious to dive deeper
122,I mean usually its kind of funny how they threatened to sue the Simpsons over a fact which is true. I guess their perspective is a given since they were created by Richard ailes and president Richard nixon.,Neutral
122,I agree. They would never win because of parody laws anyway. Did you know that every US president with a beard has been a Republican?! How odd.,Surprised
122,It seems like a strange coincidence?,Happy
122," Ha ha. Maybe. Unsurprisingly, there has not been a president that was not a democrat or republican since 1853. ",Curious to dive deeper
122,Well I believe either Roosevelt or JFK came very close as a uncorrelated 3rd party.,Neutral
122,You may be correct. I was floored to learn that the last time until very recently that a Republican president was elected without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was 1928!,Surprised
122," Wow! I didn't know the extent to which the Nixons and Bushs were so influential. I also recently found out that the colors of red and blue associated with republicans and democrats was a recent change, only starting in 2000. I wonder if they used any other colors before then?",Curious to dive deeper
122,That is a good question. I would have thought it had been that way for a longer time period than that. Did you know that Truman visited Disneyland and would not be photographed on the Dumbo ride so he wasn't associated with Republicans.,Curious to dive deeper
122," Well for politicians image is everything. At least at some level of politics, the US has been quite progressive. For instance, Texas' first elected female governor came into office even before some states ratified the 19th amendment",Neutral
122," Wow, I would not have thought that, especially with it being such a conservative state. I was sad when I learned that only one governor was against the internment of Japanese citizens during WWII. ",Sad
122," I understand the difficulties of a country given it is a melting pot and it can't let spies cause problems in WWII due to conflicting loyalties, but they didn't execute this process well and treated Americans of Japanese heritage unfairly. It is too bad only 1 governor was against their imprisonment. ",Sad
122,I agree. What a horrible blight on our history.,Sad
123,Did you know that the Beatles song Come Together was written for Timothy Leary?,Curious to dive deeper
123," No I did not, but it wouldn't surprise me since Leary's research was about the use of psychedelic drugs.",Curious to dive deeper
123," Yeah, I remember that, he was pretty out there, right? ",Curious to dive deeper
123," Yeah, he wrote about every drug under the sun haha. Although, a lot of recent evidence has proven some of his theories correct",Neutral
123,Like which ones? I'm not familiar with a lot of them.,Curious to dive deeper
123," I think like ecstasy, mushrooms, and LSD, pretty much a lot of the stuff that the government bans.",Neutral
123," OMG, I read about that. Did you know that in 1934 North Dakota's governor declared martial law? ",Curious to dive deeper
123," That's crazy, do you know for what exactly?",Curious to dive deeper
123,I'm not sure. But I know that texas elected their first female governor before some states even ratified the 19th amendment.,Curious to dive deeper
123," Yeah, and it's crazy that Texas used to be a blue state until the 1980s, then it turned very red haha",Curious to dive deeper
123," Interesting, like the ground turned red? Or you mean politics? ",Curious to dive deeper
123," No, like in politics. It used to be mostly democratic. More interestingly, the ""blue"" and ""red"" colors tow denote the two parties weren't legitimately used until 2000. ",Surprised
123," Oh, so like a long time ago Democrats were pro slavery I think. Wasn't Honest Abe a republican? ",Curious to dive deeper
123," Yeah, he was. The parties have flip flopped so much throughout US history. But on a lighter note, every president who has had a beard has been Republican, which is really crazy.",Surprised
123," I'm not sure if that is true, sadly I don't know a lot about politics, so I can't call that out if it is wrong. ",Curious to dive deeper
123,I'm somewhat interested in politics but they just make me depressed.,Sad
123," Nah, I think it is at its best now. Most entertainment in years. ",Curious to dive deeper
123,Haha that's so true,Neutral
123," You know there hasn't been a US president who hasn't been a republican or democrat since 1853, who was it? ",Curious to dive deeper
123,I think they were in the Whig Party. But I don't the president. Tyler maybe?,Neutral
124,Do you own a pet snake?,Curious to dive deeper
124,No but there are some snakes outside around where I live at.,Curious to dive deeper
124,They are considered legless lizards. I like lizards but not snakes,Neutral
124,What is your favorite type of lizard?,Neutral
124,Iguana by far. I almost bought a baby one yesterday. I was looking at Chameleons too,Neutral
124,Would you ever consider owning a larger one like a crocodile?,Neutral
124," Heck no. They are illegal too, aren't they?",Neutral
124,Oh I didn't realize they were illegal to own.,Neutral
124," They are more closely related to birds and I only like parrots for birds, and the bald eagle of course",Neutral
124,Do you like Taylor Swift?,Neutral
124," I do, kinda. I like her as a person. She seems humble and very likeable",Neutral
124," Yea, she also walks backwards around paparazzi.",Happy
124,She was born and raised close to where I grew up in Pennslyvania too,Neutral
124,Do you know about the Tennessee state?,Neutral
124,Not too much. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
124," Yes, I know more than most would about the state. There are some big snakes there.",Neutral
124,What kind of snakes are common to Tennessee? Rattlers? Bull snakes?,Curious to dive deeper
124,I think it's them rattlers!,Neutral
124," I had a bull snake in my yard last year, a big one too.",Neutral
124,What happened?,Neutral
124,I let him be and just watched him slither through my backyard,Neutral
124,Was it a big one?,Neutral
124,It appeared as so to me. I stayed far away from him because of how big he was.,Neutral
124,Did you ever about them snake whistling people?,Neutral
124,I don't understand the question.,Curious to dive deeper
125,Hi!  Do you watch the news?,Neutral
125,Yes I love watching the news. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
125," I love the information, but everything these days is so slanted from both sides sometimes it is hard to get.",Neutral
125," Right there is not one source out there that you can trust. I hate the news outlets, but still need to see what's going on.",Angry
125,Much agreed.  I find that the truth lies somewhere in the middle.  The media tries to create outrage for their ratings.,Neutral
125,Exactly. That's why I watch both CNN and Fox. It kind of helps me to sort through the muck.,Curious to dive deeper
125,Fox is watched more than Cnn and MSNBC combined.  Kinda crazy to think that.,Neutral
125,I think Fox is slightly more honest than the other two.,Neutral
125,Fox news threatened to sue the simpsons over their constant parody.,Neutral
125,I didn't know that. I don't watch the Simpsons. I know CNN is whining because they can't get any conservative guests. Why would you want to go on their show and be abused.,Curious to dive deeper
125,Why would a liberal news network want a conservative guest?,Curious to dive deeper
125,I think so that they can attempt to make them look like a liar or a fool or whatever negative thing they can think of.,Angry
125,That is true. Did you hear about that time in 1957 when Truman refused to be photographed with Dumbo,Neutral
125,No I didn't. That's funny. Maybe Dumbo wasn't crazy about the idea either.,Surprised
125,Yeah.  Maybe they should have brought Eeyore out,Neutral
125," Okay you've got me there, who's Eeyore.",Curious to dive deeper
125,He is the Donkey from winnie the pooh.,Neutral
125,Okay now I understand. He'd make a good mascot for the Demos.,Happy
125,Definitely.  Did you know the red and blue colors started being used in 2000?,Neutral
125,No I had no idea. Did you know that every president with a beard has been a Republican?,Curious to dive deeper
125," I heard that.  I wonder how many presidents had beards, I know lincoln, but who else?",Neutral
125,I can't think of any. I can't imagine someone getting elected today who even has a mustache.,Curious to dive deeper
125,Very true.  Haha.  Great chat!,Neutral
126,Good morning! Do you know anything about snakes? I saw a huge one on reddit the other day!,Surprised
126," I know that they are elongated and legless reptiles covered in scales. Furthermore, they have highly mobile jaws and usually fangs for venom.",Neutral
126,That's true. My husband pulled one out of my garden. I had never seen it before. It's a rat snake. I guess they are good for killing pests.,Curious to dive deeper
126,I think rat snakes aren't poisonous? Did you know that the fear of snakes are wired into human brains? I guess people who hate snakes should live in new Zealand since there aren't any there.,Neutral
126," Nope, rat snakes aren't poisonous. They are actually a good kind. I have always believed no snakes should exist, so I believe we are wired for it!",Curious to dive deeper
126,I wonder what differentiates snakes from legless lizards?,Curious to dive deeper
126,That is a good question. Maybe that lizards have eyelids and some snakes dont.,Curious to dive deeper
126," That makes sense. Personally, I don't mind snakes, although I am wary since venom can be quite potent and dangerous. As long as they aren't flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey are around my area and I can spot them well a head of time, I'm okay.",Neutral
126,flying snakes? My worst nightmare!!,Curious to dive deeper
126," I guess New Zealand would be ideal for you, with no snakes and all",Neutral
126,True! Do you ever Listen to Taylor Swift?,Happy
126," I have heard bits hear and there and recently read some articles, but I am not completely familiar.",Neutral
126,She writes a lot of her music about herself. Very popular singer. Who do you listen to?,Happy
126," Well I do know Kanye did a self mocking skit 2 years before the infamous Taylor swift incident. Other than that, she is among the worlds contemporary artists.",Neutral
126,And she owns a private jet!,Happy
126,I recently learn she once accidentally released several seconds of white noise and it somehow topped the Canadian itunes chart.,Surprised
126,That is funny! But she also thinks music should not be free. I disagree there. I should be able to listen to it all I want.,Curious to dive deeper
126," Well for artists, royalties are a lot part of their revenue, even for moderate artists.",Neutral
126,Thats true I suppose. Do you know Swift walks backwards so she wont have her pic taken?,Curious to dive deeper
126,Wouldn't walking backwards make her stick out more?,Neutral
126,I would think. Do you listen to Linkin park at all? they played 324 concerts in 2001.,Curious to dive deeper
126," Unfortunately, I have never listened to Linkin park. However, I have listened to The Ramones and they played a total of 2,263 concerts.",Neutral
126,Wow! I was always a big Pink Floyd fan myself. They played in an empty roman amphitheater once.,Curious to dive deeper
126,Were they recording a music video? Or did they just do it for fun? A ancient roman amphitheater sounds amazing,Curious to dive deeper
126,I think they did a video there. Thats why there was no audience! The ramones did a lot of concerts. How long did they tour?,Curious to dive deeper
126,I believe they toured for 20 years!. Anyway I think I will check out Linkin park. Thank you for the chat.,Curious to dive deeper
127,Do you watch the news?,Curious to dive deeper
127,A few times a day.,Curious to dive deeper
127," Me too, what do you think about Fox news? Apparently they are watched more than msnbc and cnn combined.",Curious to dive deeper
127,They are biased and pro republicans. It is okay though.  Free speech is always good.,Curious to dive deeper
127,Yeah your right. Fox was created by republican media strategist and a former president.,Curious to dive deeper
127,Richard Allies and former President Nixon created the fox news.,Curious to dive deeper
127,The Two Richards that's right..haha!,Curious to dive deeper
127," Yes,it was funny.  Do you know that Foxnews tried to sue the Simpsons?",Happy
127,I heard they were trying to silence a parody of anti-democratic party agenda.,Curious to dive deeper
127," Yes, you are right.  They want it to stop the Simpsons from parodying its anti democratic party agenda.",Curious to dive deeper
127,They also discussed creating a channel that would only play the Simpsons.,Curious to dive deeper
127," Yes, I heard about it.",Curious to dive deeper
127,Not sure what they hoped to accomplish since the Simpson's were never going to stop clowning them.,Curious to dive deeper
127," They own the Simpsons, right?  Why were they against them since the simpsons have been generating money for them for years?",Curious to dive deeper
127,Good question! They also owe IGN the gaming website. Do you game?,Curious to dive deeper
127,No I do not but I'm aware of the fact.,Neutral
127,Ok. On a different note did you know that when Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor he did not live in Sacramento but instead commuted everyday by jet for three hours?,Curious to dive deeper
127,I did not know that.  Do you know that the republican party is also referred to as GOP.  Arnold is a republican.,Curious to dive deeper
127," Yup! Speaking of governors, did you know that Ralph Lawrence Carr was the only one to opposed Japanese American interment camps during WW2.",Curious to dive deeper
127,I heard about it.  Good for him.  Those Japanese people were American.,Curious to dive deeper
127," They were, so sad. Texas elected it's first female governor. ",Curious to dive deeper
127,She was the second female governor in the US.,Curious to dive deeper
127," Your right, nice chatting with you. ",Curious to dive deeper
128," Hello, do you ever watch Fox News?",Curious to dive deeper
128,I usually don't watch it. I understand that it's popular.,Neutral
128,Fox discussed the possibility of creating a cable channel that would only air the Simpsons.,Surprised
128," That is an idea that might work, but now I figure people are on the Internet. Maybe a YouTube channel?",Neutral
128,Possibly...The gaming website IGN is actually owned by Fox News.,Surprised
128," Oh, I didn't know that. I guess Fox owns a lot of things out there. A gaming site? Hm.",Neutral
128,Yea very interesting. Fox News is watched more than CNN and MSNBC combined.,Surprised
128," I believe it. CNN has its own bias, as does MSNBC. People watch what they want to believe.",Neutral
128," Yep, not a huge fan of CNN because they post so much fake news and are very biased.",Neutral
128,I don't watch CNN. What kind of fake news?,Neutral
128,They just report things that are fake or swayed to the liberal spectrum of politics. Fox News was created by Richard Ailes and Richard Nixon.,Surprised
128," The viewership of Fox skews pretty old. In 2015, the median viewer age was 68 years old. Older people tend to be more conservative.",Neutral
128,That is very old. Did you know there hasn't been a president who wasn't a rep or dem since 1853?,Surprised
128," The two party system is frustrating because the choices are limited. The money backs certainly candidates, and there is little possibility for outsiders to get in.",Neutral
128,I agree. Every president with a beard has always been a republican.,Surprised
128,I guess that imparts a look of sage wisdom and manliness.,Neutral
128,I guess so lol. The last time a republican was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was back in 1928.,Surprised
128,That's quite a while. I guess Trump might be starting a new dynasty. Will his daughter run? Who knows.,Neutral
128,Haha possibly. Who knows what will happen next.,Curious to dive deeper
128," I would like to see some change in gov't. Sometimes old ideas have value. The only president to propose a guaranteed minimum income was a republican, Nixon.. I think that people are worried now and would like some security.",Neutral
128,Me too. It was good talking to you.,Happy
129,Are you familiar with Native American books?,Curious to dive deeper
129,I read a few in school.  I was raised in Oklahoma and many of my friends were of the Cherokee and Choctaw tribes.  I have heard of Tommy Orange's fiction novel about Native Americans.,Neutral
129,That's interesting!  He is a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes.  I don't know much about those two tribes.  His book is about a boy?,Happy
129,Yes.  It is fiction however.  It provides insight into the challenges that the boy has in grappling with his identity.  We have a national history where many atrocities and slurs dot the history.,Neutral
129,True!  I went to an indian reservation this past summer in New York.  It was the Seneca nation and I went through one of their museums.  They pretty much got kicked out of their land just like all the other tribes in the nation.,Happy
129," A people divided into tribes cannot stand against a unified enemy.  But, my wife's best friend has a Ph.D. and the government paid for all of her education because she is Cherokee.  But if one knows the facts, a lot of interesting history can be written.",Neutral
129,Wow.  That's really interesting.  Hopefully Tommy Orange's book does well.,Curious to dive deeper
129,Books can be fiction with a lot of facts or not so many.  Wiki has an article where they rank fictional characters according to their powers.,Neutral
129,Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction in his youth.  Never knew that he did that before.,Curious to dive deeper
129,I wonder how one would find a copy of it.  Imagine Edgar Allen Poe wrote about a cyborg a long time ago,Neutral
129,Interesting!  A judget ried to ban a science fiction comic in the 1950's because it featured a black character.,Happy
129," Wow!  We have come a long way, thank goodness.  The FDA also burned 6 tons of literature in an act of censorship.",Neutral
129,I think I remember reading about that before.  Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952.  I would like to see one of those gold medals.,Happy
129," I would like to understand the scoring.  I bet it was somewhat like Jeopardy.  I would also like to read the ""best"" of the ""worst opening sentences"" that people used to enter into a contest.",Neutral
129,lol  That would be interesting.  Didn't Sir Winston Churchill win a nobel prize for literature?,Curious to dive deeper
129," That would not be my first guess, but I think you are right!   Based on literature, kissing is a fairly recent development.",Neutral
129,You would think that would have been written about a long time ago.  Switching gears ... id you know that Apple had a clothing line in 1986?,Curious to dive deeper
129,People did not wear brands on clothing so prominently as they do today back in 1986.  So that was Apple being innovative in another field.,Neutral
129," Surprisingly, the Pilgrims wore clothing that was full of color and they only wore black for special occasions.  I'm so used to seeing them stereotyped wearing black and white.",Happy
129,Me too.  You know that every human society has worn clothes.,Neutral
129," I would hope so.  lol  I guess it depends on your body type, etc.",Happy
129," I suppose if the weather is perfect, a grass skirt might be enough, but it is still clothing.  Clothing is often gender specific.  Nice talking.",Neutral
130," Are you a fan of books?  I personally read a lot, mostly non-fiction though.",Neutral
130,I don't really have time to read but when I do I like to read fiction. I find it funny that Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Greek mythology.,Surprised
130," That is sort of odd.  There is even a wiki that ranks fictional characters by their powers, that would be an interesting read.",Neutral
130,And in Greek literature there wasn't much kissing. Romantic kissing is actually a recent development.,Surprised
130," That surprises me, I  guess I always associated it with all love stories.  Even Shakespeare.",Curious to dive deeper
130,Yeah I think there was a lot of romance just kissing wasn't part of it.,Surprised
130," I see.  Winston Churchill won a Nobel Prize, for literature.  I always though it was for peace",Neutral
130,Interesting! Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952. I always associate the olympics with sports!,Surprised
130," Same here, I always thought it was part of the ancient games but never made its way to the modern games.  How do you even judge that?",Curious to dive deeper
130," Yeah, pretty subjective. Speaking of literature contests, there isone that challenges writers to come up with the worst opening sentence for a novel.",Surprised
130," I heard there was, I wonder what the winners were, those would be fun to read.",Curious to dive deeper
130,Do you think that literature should be censored?,Curious to dive deeper
130,Absolutely not!  That is why I hated to hear that the FDA burned 6 tons of literature,Curious to dive deeper
130,But should fan fiction be allowed? George RR Martin says it is copyright infringement and isn't useful for aspiring writers.,Curious to dive deeper
130,i think so.  I think it is a great creative outlet for pepole.,Neutral
130," Have you heard of Tommy Orange's debut novel, There There?",Curious to dive deeper
130," i havenr, whats is it like?",Neutral
130,It is about Native Americans in modern history but seems to also touch on how they were treated in the past. It's a fictional story with elements of truth.,Curious to dive deeper
130,I think that might be an interesting read.,Neutral
130," The story follows around different members of a large cast of Native Americans who live in Oakland, CA. I'm not sure if I would like it because I like books that focus on one character.",Curious to dive deeper
130,I can take several focuses as long as I can put together what is going on.,Neutral
130," That's good! Some of the people speak directly to us and others use the third person, so there are diverse approaches. ",Surprised
130," It has been good chatting tonight, but my dinner is ready, and I must go.  I have a great night.",Neutral
130,Have a good night.,Happy
131,I've been reading a lot of interesting stories these past few days.,Curious to dive deeper
131,Really? what have you been reading lately?,Curious to dive deeper
131," A few different fiction stories, very interesting. One was Tommy Orange's debut novel.",Curious to dive deeper
131," I heard about that one, its the one with the little native american boy right?",Curious to dive deeper
131,Yes! It was quite an emotional read. It made me really think about how life is like for them.,Sad
131," Native Americans suffered for a lot of years, its a story that involves a lot of blood and tears and not an easy story to tell",Sad
131," Definitely! Orange did a great job w how he shared their history... It was quite diff from the 2nd book I read. A Visit From The Goon Squad, familiar?",Curious to dive deeper
131," I heard that book was pretty good as well, kind of dark though, ",Curious to dive deeper
131," For sure, there were some powerful tales. I found the sory about the man born with fetal alcohol syndrome the darkest. You?",Sad
131," I felt sorry about him as well, his mother is in jail so what kind of life can he even have, did you hear about the overweight joung man, ",Curious to dive deeper
131," Yeah, that one was crazy, he had a lot against him. Kinda sad. It all stayed w me for awhile. Had to take a break from the book.",Sad
131," I agree, so do you like fiction? ",Curious to dive deeper
131," I enjoy both fiction and non, however, I espcially like fiction books that have fact along with some imagination sprinkled in.",Happy
131,I see well did you ever play the Super Smash Bros video game? there is actaully a long fiction piece about the game,Curious to dive deeper
131," Yeah, I've played that before, I'm more of a reader though lol. I actually read two of Tommy Orange's books, he had a lot of characters!",Curious to dive deeper
131," I guess thats a great book, I heard good things about it havent really read it, ",Curious to dive deeper
131," What are you more in to - literature, clothing or gaming?",Neutral
131," I like all three of them lol, clothing is also one of my favorite subjects and I also like technology",Curious to dive deeper
131," I hear ya, I'm really into clothing too. Switching it up w textiles and materials. Did you know Apple had a clothing line in 1986?",Neutral
131," I didnt, I would buy an Apple tshirt for sure, I wonder why they dont have that clothing line anymore",Curious to dive deeper
131," Yeah same. Also, this was interesting, from 1912 to 1952 architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture were olympic events. How cool",Surprised
131," Really cool indeed, they should be events even now, I wonder why they took them out!",Curious to dive deeper
132,Are you a fan of fictions?,Curious to dive deeper
132,I am a fan somewhat!  I know that Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fictino.,Happy
132,I'm not a huge fan to be honest.,Curious to dive deeper
132,Hhaha I was when I was little more than I am now.  In the 1950's a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it featured a black character.  What a sad sign of the times back then.,Happy
132,Did you know the FDA burned 6 tons of literature in an act of censorship.,Curious to dive deeper
132,I didn't know that.  There's a wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities.,Happy
132,Interesting. Who is the best?,Curious to dive deeper
132,I don't know.  We'll have to go look on wikipedia.  lol  I know someone who was the best one year though in literature and that was in 1953 when Winston Churchill won a nobel prize for literature.,Happy
132,That's pretty cool. It wasn't for peace?,Curious to dive deeper
132,Nope.  Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952.  I wonder how they judged that?,Happy
132," LOL, by who could read the fastest? I have no idea. ",Curious to dive deeper
132,Hmmm.....that I don't know.  I think it was some girl named ...Anne?,Happy
132,Did you know that Apple had a clothing line in 1986?,Curious to dive deeper
132,I didn't know that.  I wonder if any of the pieces are worth money now as collectibles?,Happy
132,I'm not sure. It sounds like a horrible idea though. They should stick to phones.,Curious to dive deeper
132,lol  Yes.  Did you know that pilgrim clothing was full of color and they only wore black and white for special occasions?,Curious to dive deeper
132,I can believe it. A lot of those photos I thought were for Sundays.,Curious to dive deeper
132,I always seem to remember school portraying them to wear black and white.  Rip Curl makes clothes in North Korea yet the label says Made in China.  I'm not familiar with that brand.  They sound shady to me.,Happy
132," Yeah, that doesn't seem legit. Well, nice chatting with you. ",Curious to dive deeper
132,It was fun and nice chatting with you as well!,Happy
132,Take it easy!,Curious to dive deeper
133,Dogs or cats!?,Curious to dive deeper
133,Dogs!  100%,Curious to dive deeper
133,I KNEW I LIKED YOU! Google likes dogs too!,Curious to dive deeper
133," Hahaha.  yes,  definitely,  I know a few people who work there and they get to bring their dogs to work!!!!  I wish I could do that. ",Curious to dive deeper
133," what, me too. I wouldn't get anything done but it would be amazing lol! Did you know dogs have 12 different blood types?",Curious to dive deeper
133,I did.  I guess I should get my dog checked for her blood type next time I see the vet.  Do you have a dog?,Curious to dive deeper
133," I will have to, yes, his name is rocky, he is my favorite pet of all time, what is your dogs name?",Curious to dive deeper
133," her name is Yuki, it means snow in Japanese,  she is a white dog lol She is a rescue so we dont know the breed,  shes a mutt. ",Curious to dive deeper
133," aww that is cute, rescue dogs tend to be the best! I want to clone my dog when he passes he is that good. They have cloned cats before, but no thanks to a cat",Curious to dive deeper
133," lol that would be cool if you can clone your dog after they pass!  Ive had a few dogs and its heartbreaking.  I even took like 5 years break in between getting another one because I didnt know if I was ready.  Im not a cat person at all,  they are cute. ",Curious to dive deeper
133," ha i agree with that. In japan there are more pets that kids under 15, that is a lot of pets!",Curious to dive deeper
133,Oh wow.  I hope they aren't neglected in any way!,Curious to dive deeper
133,I hope not! Otherwise I am going there to stop it! They should do what boulder does and make it so you don't own pets but are their guardian,Curious to dive deeper
133,Yessssss!  I think they whole world should do that!  Did you know dogs can learn over a thousand words!,Curious to dive deeper
133," I did not know that! I know that only dogs and elephants respond to pointing, out of thousands of animals",Curious to dive deeper
133," Also,  if you actually can stop countries from eating dog,  South Korea actually sells dog meat in their street markets!  I saw it when I visited there =( it was horrifying.  Yes,  I did know that elephants and dogs are so smart. ",Curious to dive deeper
133," that is so sad and so wrong. I think I remember there was a US person at the olympics that took dogs to save from being killed, it made me feel happy",Curious to dive deeper
133," Thats amazing!  Did you know dogs have "" eureka"" moments where they feel happy solving a problem to get a reward?",Curious to dive deeper
133," What can't dogs do! I know they aren't color blind like we were taught when young. It was so nice chatting with you, tell yuki hi!",Curious to dive deeper
133,Lol Same to Rocky!  Have a good one.,Curious to dive deeper
133,will do! bye!,Curious to dive deeper
134,That sure is an interesting way to send off a family member. I guess they didn't want to falsely memorialize her.,Surprised
134," I know, I couldnt ever imagine writing something like that about my family.  I guess I am lucky.  ",Surprised
134,I feel the same way. I would rather just keep it brief and impersonal if I had hard feelings rather than publicly attack them.,Sad
134,It is said that you shouldn't speak ill of the dead.  I wouldn't feel like I needed to have the last word.,Curious to dive deeper
134," On a more enjoyable and lighter topic, do you have any pets? I have a dog.",Curious to dive deeper
134,I don't.  I am not home very much.  But I do love animals.  I would think of myself as a cat person.,Curious to dive deeper
134," Unfortunately I am allergic to cats so while I enjoy them in small doses, I don't think I could ever own one.",Sad
134," I always think it would be cool to own an exotic pet, although Id never want a bear like Roosevelt had.  ",Curious to dive deeper
134,I think he might be one of the few people who could pull off owning a bear. I would love to have one of the big cats as a pet but those are extremely dangerous as well.,Curious to dive deeper
134,There are actually more tigers living as pets in Asia than in the wild.  I never though people would seriously own them in masses.,Neutral
134,I wonder if some of those are rescues and they are technically classified as pets. It would seem like there should be strict regulations to own one.,Curious to dive deeper
134," I agree.  I would be too scared to own something that could seriously eat me in my sleep, or any other time it pleased.",Curious to dive deeper
134," It's scary enough to think that my own dog probably is strong enough to harm me, let alone one of the top predators in the world.",Fearful
134," Dogs do understand pointing, along with elephants.  They are the only two animals who have that instinct.  Id love a baby elephant, but they can get kinda big.",Curious to dive deeper
134,I've seen videos online where baby elephants interact with humans in a similar style to puppies. It's a definite bucket list experience for me!,Happy
134," Same here.  My girlfriend loves baby elephants, Ive tried to find a place we can go to have that experience.  I think it would be so cool, and a great surprise.",Curious to dive deeper
134,In looking some of those places up you want to find a place that is a rescue type facility. Unfortunately there are places that exploit the elephants and do not treat them well.,Sad
134," Definitely, not looking for somewhere they abuse the animals.  We're both big animal lovers.  I kind of like the philosophy in Boulder, CO where you can't own pets, but you are their guardian.",Neutral
134,For me my pets have always been family. I care for them more than I do some people I know.,Happy
134,Definitely a lot more loyal and loving than people,Neutral
134," She's also a lot more straightforward. She wants food, to be pet, more food, and to play with her ball. No guess work needed there.",Neutral
134,Very true.  Pets are pretty easy to please.,Neutral
134,That's probably why they're so popular worldwide!,Happy
135,Do you own a dog?,Curious to dive deeper
135," I do, did you know that dogs were the first species to be domesticated?",Curious to dive deeper
135," No, I didn't. I bet that is why they call them man's best friend. ",Curious to dive deeper
135," I guess so. They perform so many roles for humans, like hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, and companionship. I guess there's a reason why they are called that. They do a lot for humans.",Curious to dive deeper
135,Yeah. Apparently there are 12 different types of blood that a dog may have.,Curious to dive deeper
135,I didn't know that. I wonder if they get good prizes at blood drives?,Curious to dive deeper
135," LOL, good question. Google prefers dogs to cats, did you know that? ",Curious to dive deeper
135,I did not know that. Did you know that Istanbul has vending machines with food and water for stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles. I think that's such a neat idea.,Curious to dive deeper
135," No, I've never been to turkey. Have you been? ",Curious to dive deeper
135,I have many years ago.,Neutral
135,Interesting. How was it? Did you know that dogs and elephants are the only animals that understand pointing?,Curious to dive deeper
135," It was a beautiful place. I was stationed there for a few months so I didn't get to see too much. I didn't know that. I always thought that dogs were color blind, but they're not they just can't see as many different colors as humans. ",Curious to dive deeper
135," Yeah, that's what I've heard. The first cloned pet was a cat, did you know that? ",Curious to dive deeper
135," I didn't know that, would you call that a ""copy cat?"" haha",Surprised
135," Hilarious, well there are more tigers living as pets in the US than living in the wild in Asia. ",Curious to dive deeper
135," That's crazy, I heard that Theodore Roosevelt had over 20 pets, including a bear and a hyena. ",Curious to dive deeper
135," Yeah, he was a big conservationist. What number president was he?",Curious to dive deeper
135,I believe he was the 26th. Did you know that in Japan there's more pets than there are children under 15?,Curious to dive deeper
135," No, I didn't know that. They have a population growth problem it appears. ",Curious to dive deeper
135," It seems that way. I've heard that it's illegal to ""own"" pets in Boulder, Colorado, but you can be their ""guardian."" Does that mean you can claim them on your taxes?",Curious to dive deeper
135," Interesting. I know people in Boulder, I'll have to ask them that. Well nice chatting with you. ",Curious to dive deeper
136,Did you know that dogs have 12 different blood types?,Surprised
136," Hello, wow no I didn't. Istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for the city's stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles.",Neutral
136,Good idea!  Dogs and elephants are the only animals instinctively understanding pointing.  I wonder where that leaves monkeys?,Surprised
136," Good question.  Dogs are not colour blind, but cannot see as many different colours as humans",Happy
136," When they first cloned a cat, they named it copy cat.  Haha",Happy
136," Haha, that's good stuff there.  It is not legal to ""own"" pets in boulder, colorado, but you may be their ""guardian.""",Happy
136," I wonder what the difference is?  Teddy Roosevelt had over 20 pets.  I didn't know this, but he had a bear (teddy bear).",Surprised
136," Wow, that's an interesting fact.  Check this out. In japan, there are more pets than there are children under 15",Happy
136," wow, that's a lot of pets. Do they have 1 child laws too?",Curious to dive deeper
136,I've heard that.  Are pets also used in their meals?,Sad
136,I don't know.  The emperor of Japan is a scientist and publishes papers.  He must have a lot of influence in various realms.,Surprised
136," Interesting, Harrison schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon.",Curious to dive deeper
136," And scientist john von neumann could by the age of 6, divide two 8 digit numbers in his head and converse in ancient greek. I wonder how that happens.",Surprised
136," Good gracious, what a brainiac.  The world wide web was invented in 1989 by an english scientist working in switzerland for the cern, a european state-funded research organization.",Curious to dive deeper
136," I don't know how they did it, but scientists at Harvard stored a gif animation of a galloping horse in the dna of bacteria",Curious to dive deeper
136," That's nuts.  Many scientists have advanced degrees in an area of science and pursue careers in various sectors of the economy such as academia, industry, government, and nonprofit environments.",Surprised
136,Scientist wasn't a term until the 19th century,Surprised
136," Really?  On another note, Google prefers dogs to cats. their code of conduct specifically states that they are a dog company.",Curious to dive deeper
136,Does that mean they donate more to dogs?,Curious to dive deeper
136," I'm not sure on that.  Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors. ",Curious to dive deeper
136," I don't know how, but there are more tigers living as pets in the US than living wild in Asia.  I didn't even know you could have one as a pet.  Sounds Dangerous!",Fearful
137,Fiction works comes from the imagination.,Neutral
137,Yes. I like fiction. There is a wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers.,Neutral
137," Fun, Julius caesar actually wrote fan fiction of hercules.",Surprised
137,That is intriguing. Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction. Did you hear that?,Neutral
137," Great, George rr martin doesn't like fan fiction at all.",Surprised
137,I heard that. He thinks it's copyright infingement.,Neutral
137," Yes he does, Snakes are legless and carnivores.",Neutral
137," Ah. Yeah, There is a genus of flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey.",Neutral
137," Scary, New zealand doesn't have any snakes.",Surprised
137,That sounds great. There are legless lizards... almost as frightening as snakes.,Neutral
137," Yes, some of them have eyelids and ears!",Surprised
137,That's creepy. Makes me want to listen to music. Do you like rap?,Disgusted
137," Yes, Tupac's music is in the library of congress.",Surprised
137," Wow. You know, Korean rappers invented ""compliment battle""? ",Surprised
137," Interesting, rap is normally delivered over a beat.",Neutral
137," Yes. It's original meaning was ""to lightly strike"".  Now it describes quick speech.",Neutral
137," Yes, eminem wanted to be a comic book artist.",Surprised
137,Intriguing. Did you hear about the judge in Michigan who delivered a ruling againt him? She delivered it by rapping when she ruled.,Neutral
137," Funny, the earliest rap was in the west african tradiation.",Neutral
137,Oh. Seems reasonable I guess. Did you know that flow is a component of rap?,Neutral
137," Yes, flow and delivery.",Happy
138,Good morning.  Do you like snakes?,Neutral
138,Not really!  lol  I guess I do as long as they leave me alone.,Happy
138,Same here.  Personally I'd like to live in New Zealand. I hear they don't have any snakes there.,Neutral
138,Nice!  I didn't know that.  Only 70 percent of the worlds snakes lay eggs.,Happy
138,Seriously?  Then I guess the rest do live births?,Neutral
138,Yes.  Boas and some others give live birth.,Happy
138,Well that's creepy.  It's as creepy as knowing there are some snakes that can fly.,Neutral
138," Yikes!  I don't want to see those.  Not even in a zoo.  lol  When snakes are born with 2 heads, they fight each other food.  That's creepy too.  Is that a common thing with snakes?????",Happy
138,i don't know. That does seem really weird to picture a snake fighting itself.,Neutral
138,I know right?  I'm going to have to google it.  A man has been bitten so many times by snakes that his blood is able to be used as antivenom.  I wouldn't want to be him.,Happy
138,Me either.  They say that our brains are naturally hard wired to be afraid of snakes.,Neutral
138,I believe it.  I jump and shout when I see one. lol  Australia is the only continent where ven9omous snakes outnumber the non-venomous ones.,Happy
138,I totally believe that. i've seen things about that country on tv.  They seem to have a lot of scary creatures over there.,Neutral
138," Those salt water crocs. I wouldn't want to cross paths with either from there. lol  Some owls keep blind snakes in their nests as helpful associates, reducing the abundance of nest parasites.  How interesting is that?  ...and how do they know they are blind? lol",Happy
138," Wow, that is actually a good question! I don't know. I do know that oddly enough, crocodiles are more closely related to birds than snakes and lizards.",Neutral
138,That's interesting!  Do you happen to read any fiction at all?,Happy
138," I used to.  I like the older fiction.  Speaking of, cyborgs are a lot older than we think.  Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of one in one of his works.",Neutral
138,I didn't know that.  The term robotics was accidentally coined by science fiction author Isaac Asimov in 1941.,Happy
138,I didn't know that!  So he just accidentally made it up?,Neutral
138,I guess so.  lol  Do you know what a drabble is?,Curious to dive deeper
138,i honestly have no idea.,Neutral
139," Hi, how are you?",Happy
139," Hi, I'm Good. Have you heard of the book Strange objects? It is going to be a HBO miniseries. Many critics think it it the author's break through.",Neutral
139,I have not heard of the book or the miniseries. I do have HBO and will look for it when it comes out.,Happy
139,That is good. It focuses on how the female characters negatively treat one another. It is unusual because it gives it's female characters permission to be bad.,Neutral
139," Nice. I think I do remember that one now. It's with Amy Adams I think... I did see Gone Girl, did you see that one?",Happy
139," I didn't, but I know it is by the same author, Gillian Flynn. The author wrote Sharp Objects because she wanted to explore how women aren't innately good and was sick of literature's tendency to portray women as spunky girls or bad girls like tramps and vamps.",Neutral
139," lynn's novels are feminist precisely because they aim a megawatt beam, bright as prison lights, into the dark corners of women's minds and lives",Happy
139," I think you can really see this in the first line of Sharp Objects, where she write that ""I was never a good little girl."" Amy Dunne in Gone Girl was the same way.",Neutral
139,There's a wiki which ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities.,Happy
139," That is interesting. I wonder if Camille's (from Sharp Objects) beauty could be considered a power or ability. The novel manages to put an interesting spotlight on it. But, it doesn't reduce her or her beauty to an archetype.",Neutral
139,Couldn't it be both? Couldn't her looks be a power and a liability when she uses them inappropriately?,Happy
139," Yes, that is a good point. I bet the author would like that give her attempts to avoid the archetypes surrounding beauty in fiction. Camille is neither an angel or a temptress.",Neutral
139,Her beauty is part of her underlying charatcher which allows her to have so many more dimensions than just beauty.,Happy
139," True, of course some people think that the author goes to far by making all her female characters unlikable. They think that this undermines women by portraying them this way.",Neutral
139,I always question how the author should portray the protaginist in her own books... What's appropriate for the author is not for the reader.,Happy
139,So true that the author and reader can differ on interpretations. I am glad that the author doesn't fetishize violence though. Many authors do that. She likes to show how it can be deadly to be male too.,Neutral
139,That's a really good point and a nuance most miss. I believe great authors can use sexism and sex as a great distinguisher yet subtle at the same time.,Curious to dive deeper
139," True, it is interesting how Flynn tries to be psychologically accurate above all. ",Neutral
139," Going inside the mind of a ficticious person, created in your mind, must be difficult.",Curious to dive deeper
139,It's true. Have you ever read drabbles? they are only 100 words long. It is interesting to think how you could go into someone's mind in 100 words. It must be different then a long novel like sharp objects.,Curious to dive deeper
139,Nice chatting with you.,Happy
140," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
140," Great! Hope you're doing well! Are you a fan of fiction by chance? If so, there's a wiki you should check out that ranks characters in fiction by their powers and abilities!",Neutral
140,I do like comics. I fell in love with it when Edgar allen poe wrote about it.,Happy
140," He wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg, correct? That is awesome! Fiction is derived from the imagination and Poe had a great imagination!",Happy
140,Yeah. I liked Poe. Tell Tale Heart scared the heck out of me!,Fearful
140,So true! I would like to read some of Julius Caesar's Hercules fan fiction sometimes. Or even Oedipus. I bet it's amazing.,Neutral
140,Just don't show George martin any... He's not a fan of fan fiction...,Sad
140," Ha! Yeah I heard he claimed it's copyright infringement and also bad exercises for aspiring writers. I mean, he's not wrong, but a little over the top I'd say!",Neutral
140,I think fan fiction is good. I bet he also complains that people do not write enough or how it is  lonely experience and then also complains about flattery... Seems like an inconsistent thought process.,Sad
140,Agreed! It's almost as ignorant as the judge who tried to ban a science fiction  comic all because it featured a black character back in 1950! The audacity of some people!,Angry
140,And in 2001 a judge delivered her ruling in the form of a rap. Stay in your lane your honor!,Happy
140," Ha! While trying a suit filed against Eminem! I heard about that. Speaking of Eminem, crazy he wanted to be a comic book artist growing up. What might have been had he pursued that instead if rap!",Surprised
140,yeah. I think he chose wisely. I am not sure how successful he would have been at compliment rap though.,Curious to dive deeper
140,Ha! Can't believe That's even a thing. But I suppose it's popular enough in Korea so it must be at least intriguing to see!,Curious to dive deeper
140," Intriguing, like Busta Rhymes voicing the reptar wagon in Rugrats?",Curious to dive deeper
140,Did he really? I'll have to go back and watch that movie now just to see if I recognize his voice! Ha! Reptar was a lizard right? Better that than a snake - or even a flying snake which there happens to be a genus of that can actually launch themselves at their prey. Imagine coming across one of those. Yikes!,Fearful
140,Nope! I would run so fast! I am not a snake fan and then throw in a flying snake.... NOPE!,Fearful
140,Same here. It's crazy that the fear of snakes is hard wired in both the brains of humans and monkeys!,Surprised
140," I know. Poor monkeys have no idea, they just run. My 7 year old asked about getting a snake and I shut that down quickly!",Fearful
140," I don't blame you. I wouldn't want a snake or even one of those legless lizards that look like snakes even though they basically aren't. If it looks like a snake, I don't want it!",Fearful
140,Nice chatting with you!,Happy
141," Hello, do you like movies?",Curious to dive deeper
141,I do. Do you like movies?,Curious to dive deeper
141,I do quite a bit. DO you know who hold the record for the most box hits?,Curious to dive deeper
141,Denzel Washington?,Curious to dive deeper
141,It id actually Tom Hanks with $8.5 billion worldwide,Curious to dive deeper
141,WOW! I did love him as the voice of Woody in toy story but I just love pixar.,Happy
141,I love Pixar too. Did you know Disney wanted to shut down their studio because sleeping beauty was a bust,Curious to dive deeper
141,That would have been short sighted. Can you imagine making only $309? I would be so sad...,Sad
141," I know, but good thing they did not shut down the studio",Curious to dive deeper
141,Can you imagine taking your valentines to silence of the lambs?,Curious to dive deeper
141," No, that would be horrible. Do you know which was one of the most expensive office flops?",Curious to dive deeper
141," No, which one?",Curious to dive deeper
141,It was Treasure Planet,Curious to dive deeper
141,I had no clue?,Curious to dive deeper
141," Yeah, too bad for them. Do you like comedy?",Curious to dive deeper
141," yes, I do. Do you?",Curious to dive deeper
141,Yes me too. Do you know which movie Bill Murray thinks is the best comedy?,Curious to dive deeper
141,stripes?,Curious to dive deeper
141,Actually Kung Fu Hustle,Curious to dive deeper
141,WOW! I would have thought it would have been a good movie and not that one. I wonder if he was being sarcastic.,Curious to dive deeper
141,I am wondering about it too. He called it the supreme achievement of the modern age in comedy. Nice chat :),Happy
142,Hello do you like movies?,Curious to dive deeper
142," Yes, I do.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
142,awesome!  Yes I love movies. Tom hanks is the highest box office star!,Curious to dive deeper
142," I love him, he's such a versatile actor and has played in some of my favorite movies.  Did you know Disney thought about shutting down their studio after Sleeping beauty flopped at the box office?",Curious to dive deeper
142," Yikes, was it that bad?  I have only seen it like once or twice lol.  Glad they didnt, they have come out with some really good stuff",Curious to dive deeper
142," I know right?  I loved it as a kid, I didn't think it was that bad.  You know I knew Silence of The Lambs made lots of money at the box office, but I didn't realize it came out on Valentine's day in 1991.  Did you?",Curious to dive deeper
142," Yeah, so romantic right!  lol that was a great movie,  kinda ironic about the valentines day thing lol",Curious to dive deeper
142,Did you watch the Avengers: Infinity Wars movie ?,Curious to dive deeper
142," Yes, I did,  great movie as well,  I hear it was filmed in all imax cameras! ",Curious to dive deeper
142," I loved it too!  Can't wait for the next one, I'll probably cry all over again, when I see who all died at the end of the movie.",Sad
142,Yeah coming out next month I think.  It was pretty sad at the end.  Bring tissue this time!,Curious to dive deeper
142," Thanos sucks!  Anyway, I haven't seen RBG, have you?",Curious to dive deeper
142,What is that?,Curious to dive deeper
142," Movie about the life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  It sounded too dry and I'm not much of a feminist, so I passed on that one.",Neutral
142," Oh that one,  no I didnt watch it lol I did read about it. Do you like comedy?",Curious to dive deeper
142," Yes, I do.  Mostly old stuff with Bill Murray, though!",Happy
142," Hes amazing,  real funny!  He thinks kung fu hustle is the supreme acchievement of modern age in terms of comedy.  I dont know about that,  it was a great movie,  but not amazing lol what do you think?",Curious to dive deeper
142," Me either, he must have had a few when he said that!  What I found astonishing was that 3rd rock from the sun beat out Seinfeld, Fraser,and Friends for the 1997 Golden Globe.",Surprised
142," Yeah 3rd rock was funny,  but I dont think its better than seinfeld or friends. lol ",Curious to dive deeper
142," I agree, Seinfeld and Friends are classics.  I smell a bribe!",Surprised
142,Right!  lol Its weird that comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows.,Curious to dive deeper
142," Yeah, that is kind of odd!  Well, it's been nice chatting with you, I need to go walk my dog, now.  ",Surprised
142," Great chatting, thanks. ",Neutral
143,Did know Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star?,Curious to dive deeper
143," I didnt know that, I love him as an actor, he is so talented I guess that makes sense",Curious to dive deeper
143," Disney should have used Tom in ""treasure planet"" it was the most expensive box office flop of all time. HAHA",Neutral
143," I bet the movie would have had a bigger box office with him in the movie, did you watch Trojan Wars?",Curious to dive deeper
143," No, I didn't. I read that it earned over $309,000,000 in box office. Someone is rich.",Surprised
143," No, only $309 dollars, it was a failure in fact, it was one of the most expensive box office flops all time",Curious to dive deeper
143,Oh! Thanks for that. I read it wrong.,Surprised
143," Yeah, the budget was of $15 million dollars, did you ever watch the movie The Silence of the Lambs?",Curious to dive deeper
143," Yes, that is a very scary movie.",Curious to dive deeper
143,It came out on Valentines day and it had a good box office. That was in the year 1991,Curious to dive deeper
143," Yes, I think I read $270 million in box office.",Neutral
143," Yeah, that was a total success so do you like comedy films as well",Curious to dive deeper
143,I love comedy. It's my favorite.,Happy
143,Do you like Bill Murray? he seems to like Kung Fu hustle a lot.,Curious to dive deeper
143,I do like him but I don't know kung fu hustle.,Curious to dive deeper
143," He says is the supreme achievement of modern comedy, well I dont agree with that, I didnt like that movie really",Curious to dive deeper
143,I totally agree with you.,Neutral
143,Do you like the channel Comedy Central?,Curious to dive deeper
143,I have watched a few shows on there. My son loves it.,Neutral
143,I love it as well but it makes me mad that they've cancelled over 100 shows since its creation,Curious to dive deeper
143,I would think that what is funny changes over time.,Neutral
143,Yeah I guess so but many of those shows were good! anyways its been nice chatting with you today,Curious to dive deeper
143,Nice chatting with you too.,Neutral
144,good morning.,Happy
144,Hi there!  Do you like comedies?,Curious to dive deeper
144,Yeah I love a good comedy.,Happy
144,Me too!  Did you see Bill Murray's Kung Fu Hustle?,Happy
144,I think I may have seen it. I dont see it as the supreme achievement in comedy like he does though.,Happy
144,I was going to ask what you thought about it.  Jack Black was going to star in the Green Lantern which was originally supposed to be a comedy.,Happy
144,I think it would have been better as a comedy. I like Jack Black movies.,Happy
144,I love them!  He cracks me up.  I like corny goofball comedy.  I used to like watching 3rd Rock from the Sun when it was on tv for that same reason.,Happy
144,Yeah I liked the goofy brother. Dont remember his name. I thought he was funny.,Happy
144," Yes.  I can picture his face, but can't remember his name either.  That show won a golden globe for best comedy series in 1997.",Happy
144,considering the other shows that were on at the time that is surprising.,Happy
144," Yes.  It beat out Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier.",Happy
144,Well me personally. I would rather watch third rock any day. Those other shows were quite popular in their day though.,Happy
144,Yes.  I agree.  Do you know who the highest all time box office star is?,Happy
144,Yeah its Tom hanks. Over 8.5 billion in the Box office. Thats a lot of money.,Happy
144," Holy smokes!  You're not kidding!  Did you know Disney's animation studios almost shut down after ""Sleeping Beauty"" was a box office failure?",Happy
144," It may have flopped in the box office, but it became pretty popular after that. I would say they made a good bit of money off sleeping beauty.",Happy
144," I would think so too.  However it wasn't their biggest flop.  That would have been ""Treasure Planet"" which was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time!",Happy
144,I dont think I even saw that one.,Happy
144," I remember it, but don't remember seeing it either.  Silence of the Lambs had a box office of over $270 million and came out on Valentines Day 1991.",Happy
144,That was a good movie. Still a classic. Have  a good one.,Happy
145," Hey how is it going, you ever cook a turkey during Thanksgiving?",Curious to dive deeper
145," No, the only bird I ever cook is chicken; I'm looking to expand my skillset, though! They're the most numerically successful class of tetrapods.",Neutral
145," Ah I gotcha, I was going to say there are some tips to maximize space in the oven during Thanksgiving, but that might just bore both of us haha. That's pretty cool about chickens, there are over 10000 birds that classify as tetrapods.",Curious to dive deeper
145," I'm sure that some like hummingbirds don't lend themselves to eating, but I know that ostrich steaks are a thing; I wonder how to cook those! I guess they can be so big because they don't fly.",Neutral
145," True, I'm surprised they still have wings. I cannot believe how small hummingbirds are, only 2 inches!",Surprised
145,I guess they're still evolving to the point where the wings disappear. Some birds don't get that chance--the famously extinct dodo bird is actually a sub-family a pigeon that I guess didn't evolve as much as it needed to!,Neutral
145," Interesting, it's funny that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. That is really cool to me.",Surprised
145," That's very resourceful. Some wild birds in Australia are resourceful in mimicking the human world sounds of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaw, although I'm not sure exactly what purpose that would serve.",Neutral
145," I've heard that, they're pretty resourceful. I didn't know how light birds were, their skeleton is hollow and weighs less than the feathers.",Curious to dive deeper
145,Maybe that's why some birds are able to migrate from Alaska to northern Mexico without sleeping; the light weight must keep them from getting too exhausted.,Neutral
145," That is some cardio! They all have feathers, beaked jaws, lay eggs and have a four chambered heart, I wonder how far they are from dinosaurs.",Curious to dive deeper
145," Even if they are distantly related, I bet dinosaurs didn't dance the way some birds do to impress their potential mates. They're more closely related to humans in that way.",Neutral
145,I bet not. At least they don't have to worry about having 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week to go through like professional ballet dancers.,Curious to dive deeper
145," That's a lot, but I guess that kind of dancing is stressful on shoes that are supporting the weight on such as small surface. Did you know that Tupac danced ballet in high school and was even the mouse king in a production of the Nutcracker?",Neutral
145," I never knew that, I did know Bruce Lee was a great dancer that won a dancing championship in 1958.",Surprised
145," That kind of makes sense, since there's so much coordinated movement in both martial arts and dance. It would be more odd if a dancer ended up being a video game pro.",Neutral
145," True, especially if they became a professional Tetris player lol.",Curious to dive deeper
145," Yes, it is actually one of the three best-selling video games of all time, along with Minecraft and Wii Sports,",Neutral
145," I can't believe it was made in 1984 by Alexy Pajitnov, the government owned the rights to it too.",Curious to dive deeper
145," I guess that's a consequence of working for the Soviets. Meanwhile, the NHS in the UK actually advocates using the game for people suffering from PTSD.",Neutral
145," I could see that, it helps you escape what you are feeling and what not. Could help those suffering from trauma too.",Surprised
145," Yes, and research suggests that playing Tetris provides a quick fix for people struggling to stick to diets or quit smoking or drinking.",Neutral
145," For sure, a lot of stimulation. I am going to get going though, good talking with you, have a great weekend!",Curious to dive deeper
146,Hi there. Do you like to play video games?,Curious to dive deeper
146,I used to play them when I was younger. I was never good at Tetris though even though it is one of three best selling video games of all.,Happy
146,I was into Tetris for a while. My mom got addicted to it and stole my Gameboy a lot. I wonder if she started seeing tetris blocks in her sleep. That happens to some people who play tetris for an extended period of time.,Curious to dive deeper
146,That is so weird! As an adult I wish i was good at Tetris when I quit smoking or trying to diet because it can offer a quick fix when people are struggling to stick to working on either.,Curious to dive deeper
146," Yeah, and they also will regularly identify tetromino shapes in real life like in patterns on buldings or in layouts of boxes. Haha, hilarous.",Surprised
146," Okay, well then maybe I'm not so sad that I am not good at it. I would not want to deal with that.",Happy
146,Right? Haha. I didn't know that Tetris was actually from the Soviet Union. I thought it was just part of the Tetris design where there were Russian buildings.,Surprised
146," Yes, Alexey Pajitinov was the original designer and programmer.",Curious to dive deeper
146,You mentioned that Tetris can help with addictions. Well it can also help with PTSD. So if you can deal with seeing Tetris shapes everywhere it might be a good option for PTSD.,Sad
146," Oh! I'm glad you're still here. I thought you were gone. Well, that is great for PTSD sufferers. ",Happy
146," No, it just takes me a while to think of what to say. Do you ever play dance video games?",Curious to dive deeper
146," No, but I enjoy dance performances. Did you know Tupac was a ballet dancer?",Curious to dive deeper
146," That is neat. Speaking of ballet dancers, they can go through four pairs of pointe shoes a week. Sounds painful and expensive!",Curious to dive deeper
146," Yes, that does, I agree! I think its cute that babies hear music and spontaneously dance.",Happy
146," When they hit the beat! So babies can hit the beat but it seems like a lot of us adult forget how to, haha.",Surprised
146,I know I have a hard time! When babies hit the beat it makes them smile.,Happy
146,One thing that makes me smileis Michael Jackson's dance. I didn't know that to achieve lean he used a device which he patented.,Surprised
146," That was smart. those moves were pretty extreme, so that explains a lot of how it was done.",Happy
146,Right. Bruce Lee was another great dancer. He won a Cha Cha championship.,Surprised
146,Did he really? Where did he do that? In the USA? Sounds like he is a multi-talented guy.,Curious to dive deeper
146,That was in Hong Kong.Now I want to see if there is any footage of him dancing. Have a good day!,Happy
147,Do you like birds?  I love watching them!,Curious to dive deeper
147," I do, too! So many of them are beautiful, and even the ones that aren't are still incredibly unique. They can be anywhere between 2 inches or 9 feet!",Neutral
147,I think it's incredible how easily they can fly.  It's probably because their bones are so hollow that the entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers!,Happy
147," Probably! Did you know one of the smallest birds, a hummingbird, will actually steal spider webs construct and repair their nests?",Neutral
147," That's funny!  There are wild birds in Australia that can mimic the sound of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws. That could get noisey!",Happy
147,Wow. I wonder if they're in the parrot family or if other birds outside of the parrot family can mimic sounds like that?,Neutral
147,That's a good possibility!  The extinct dodo bird is actually a sub family of pigeon.  Interesting.,Happy
147,That is interesting! Can you believe there are some birds that will migrate all the way from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping?,Neutral
147,That's pretty incredible!  Do you like to dance?,Curious to dive deeper
147," Only if I've had a couple of drinks, but I respect the art form absolutely. How about you?",Neutral
147,I can't dance but wish I could.  Tupac danced ballet in high school and ended up portraying the mouse king in the Nutcracker!,Happy
147,That's pretty impressive! Bruce Lee was also evidently a pretty good dancer. He won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha Championship in 1958!,Neutral
147,Wow.  I had no idea he danced but I can see that going hand in hand with the karate moves.,Happy
147,Most definitely. Did you know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music? I guess we as humans appreciate rhythm regardless of age!,Neutral
147,I didn't know that.  Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.  That could get expensive!,Happy
147," Definitely! Though I can imagine why, standing on your tip-toes so frequently with all of your body weight must be extremely taxing on shoes!",Neutral
147,Ouch!  That's all I'll say.  I would have broken toes.  Michael Jackson has a patent on a device that was used to help him achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves.,Happy
147," Hey, have you ever played Tetris?",Neutral
147," I did back in the day.  The 3 best selling videogames of all time are Tetris, Minecraft, and Wii sports.  I had fun chatting with you!",Happy
147," You, too! I may go play some tetris, but that whole phenomenon of blocks falling in my sleep if I play too long freaks me out!",Neutral
147,LOL Have a great night!,Happy
148,Hello! What do you enjoy doing for entertainment?,Surprised
148,I really love to cook. Thanksgiving in my favorite holiday to cook for. Planning the meal and making everything fit on my oven is like tetris.,Curious to dive deeper
148," Yes, so do I! and I agree, Thanksgiving and Chsitmas are my favorite Holidays. and you are right especially if you only have one oven to work with like susan westmoreland says ""it's a bit like an acrobatic dance"" lol",Curious to dive deeper
148," Great way to make a word picture, yes! I would totally agree. Planning backwards are what some experts say to do, like Susan Gage Caterers.",Curious to dive deeper
148," haha, true! Another of my all time fav things to do would be dance! although my back doesnt like it so much. I love watching dance videos...",Curious to dive deeper
148," Oh yeah, me too!Dancing while I bake pies for Thanksgiving is an exacta. I have a guilty pleasure of dancing to ballet musicals. I read that those ballerinas go through four pairs of pointe shoes per week.!",Curious to dive deeper
148," That is a daily, cooking and dancing! and ouch! 4 pairs! Oh my word, that beats my once every year. Another great dance was Michael Jackson, he had a patent on a device, I didnt know you could achieve lean in dance moves",Curious to dive deeper
148," Really, that is a cool fact. I liked his music even though the person is in question.",Curious to dive deeper
148," True, its hard to know truth from lies in the media unfortunately, Bruce lee was also a great dancer he even won the hong kong cha-cha championship in 1958! I didnt know there was such a thing.",Curious to dive deeper
148," The Cha Cha winner! How cool is that, Bruce Lee was an amazing athlete all the way around. I think its so sweet how babies can spontaneously dance when they hear music.lol",Curious to dive deeper
148," Yes, I have 2 year old twin boys and they Love to ""shake shake shake, shake your booty"" haha they crack up everytime. They love to dance and watch our birds. Do you have birds?",Curious to dive deeper
148," How precious! lol. Oh yeah, we have many many birds that come fly into our windows, in fact. Hummingbirds steal the spider webs to construct the own nests too, thats a nice bonus for me and less cleaning too.",Curious to dive deeper
148," Wow, yes birds are amazing creatures and so light! their light bones are so hollow sometimes weighing less than their feathers. Love them.",Curious to dive deeper
148," Yes, so delightful and treasured. Mine will mimic things that make me run looking for alarms sometimes.lol",Curious to dive deeper
148," haha, I always wondered what such distances they can fly without resting. Ive learned that some birds can fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping.. I wish I could fly! Vacations would be way cheaper!",Curious to dive deeper
148," Gosh, that's a good point and they would be a lot more affordable. I am addicted to playing tetris when I fly because it takes my mind off of flying. Tetris is proven to be a quick and manageable fix for people who are trying to stick to a diet, quit smoking or drinking. I use it for flying.",Curious to dive deeper
148," Tetris! such a great game, reminds me of my youth, Its been around since ive been around lol well I guess tetris is a few years older 1984 it was created! ",Curious to dive deeper
148," Yes, mine too. It is one of three of the greatest games of all time. Minecraft and Sport Wii are the other two. The tetris game has been used to help people suffering with PTSD,also.",Curious to dive deeper
148,Interesting! Do you know where it was created?,Curious to dive deeper
148," Yes, it was created in Russia by a man who almost never made any money from it but eventually he did in 1996. I must admit I had the tetris effect for a while after I played. I would see everything in blocks and a way to fit.",Curious to dive deeper
148," Wow, It was truly a great invention and it traveled such a far way... from Russia!",Curious to dive deeper
148," Gosh, yes it did. Over every ocean too. The franchise sold more than 495 million copies not counting all the downloads in todays time.",Curious to dive deeper
148," I learned so much today, Thank you. It was fun chatting with you! Hugs and much Love to you! Take care!",Curious to dive deeper
149,Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;),Happy
149,Me too.  Would you believe it if I told you that the Chicago Cubs last won a World Series when the Ottoman Empire was still in existence?,Neutral
149," am... no, I don't think I would believe that... ;) was that in Wikipedia ? ;) lol",Curious to dive deeper
149," Maybe a saved version of wikipedia.  I won't soon forget when the Cubs really did win, back in 2016, over my Indians.",Sad
149,Your ? ;)  at that time You were cheering for Indians ?,Curious to dive deeper
149,Yes.  I'm not the owner of the team ;) ... they're just from my hometown.,Neutral
149,Although I'm Polish - I got that ;) lol. How are they doing these days ?,Curious to dive deeper
149," Pretty good, on top of their division last year, but no where as good as the Red Sox.  They had an amazing start to the year, and then they won the World Series.",Happy
149," Holy crap, nice. Probably fat bonuses for everybody... but hey... if they made their fans happy, why the heck not... they earned it !",Happy
149," They did.  It was almost too easy.  They have great pitchers, good hitters, and a new manager.  Normally, a new manager isn't a help, but he was from the team who won the World Series the year before, The Houston Astros.",Neutral
149,Huh... do You think he knows a secret for winning World Series ? ;)  idk... I think it's just a well paid team ;),Curious to dive deeper
149," Money and chemistry build winning teams, if you ask me.  Baseball is popular in the US, Japan, and a few other places.  Is it played much in Poland?",Curious to dive deeper
149," Not really, but we do buy baseball bats :) to go watch soccer games on a stadium :)",Curious to dive deeper
149," You buy bats?  Why?  I used to collect baseball cards, which can be quite valuable!",Curious to dive deeper
149,well... when one soccer team meets other soccer team and those two towns/teams are not friendly... You need to take whatever You can smuggle to the stadium to fight off the hooligans from the other team ;) lol - baseball bats are selling good in Poland but nobody plays the game ;) lol,Happy
149," ah ... that's a little scary.  I suppose without a baseball bat, my simple weapon of choice would be  ...  something else I can't think of.  Fascinating.  I do like soccer.  I'm a Croat (half really), so the World Cup was exciting this year.  Unfortunately, only the women's world cup is more popular in the US than the baseball world series.",Sad
149,Croatia won out hearts this Worldcup - seriously - great job guys   ! It was a pleasure to watch Your matches !,Surprised
149,Do you think Modric was really the best player in the tournament?,Curious to dive deeper
149," In the entire tournament? Maybe not the actual best, but he showed a lot of passion for sure !",Curious to dive deeper
149," Fair enough.  Do you think soccer coaches are important to the winning of a team, like they are in baseball?",Curious to dive deeper
149," they sure are, but these days with so much primadonnas in the team, I think they have a tough job to do...",Curious to dive deeper
149," Yes, I get the impression that soccer players are paid very much.  Baseball has some of those, but only a few total and maybe one or two on each team.",Sad
149,Yeah.... that among some other reasons doomed our Polish team in World Cup... sad really...,Curious to dive deeper
149," Well, I would root for the Polish team.  I have great respect for your country.",Neutral
149," as my for Yours brother ;)  what a kind thing to say, thank You ! :)",Curious to dive deeper
149,Thank you.  It was nice to talk with you.,Happy
150,Would you much of a baseball fan?,Curious to dive deeper
150,A little.  I just read something about the Boston Red Sox.  They has some hard core fans.,Neutral
150,I guess they are doing well at the moment.  they went so long without winning anything and now they can't stop.,Happy
150,Yeah. Mookie Betts seems to really be getting some distance on his hits.,Surprised
150," That's a new name to me, seems like a name from a Star Wars movie.  I wonder if they are the best team in baseball right now?",Happy
150,I really don't know.  They have a picture named Porcello that is really good.  It sounds like they have a good balance between pitching and hitting.,Neutral
150,I'm originally from a different country but my wife is from Cleveland.  She used to get very excited in the late nineties when they had a good team.,Happy
150,That's cool.  I guess FanGraphs estimates that the Red Sox have a 71% chance to win the division.  That's good for your wife.  What country are you from?,Curious to dive deeper
150," England, been here over twenty years.  Have not really got into baseball, went to a few games in the past at Camden Yard and Jacobs Field.",Happy
150," Well, a very belated ""welcome"".  Are you a cricket fan?  I didn't realize that the NYT owned part of the Sox.  ",Surprised
150," I am, used to play to a fairly high level.  Isn't that sacrilege for the NYT to be involved with Boston, or are they just hedging their bets.",Surprised
150," Yes, I had the same thought.  They are such rivals.  It's wild that baseball managers can actually play in the game.  I have never seen that.",Surprised
150," I guess it's in the rules, that's why they wear the uniform.  I'd love to see one of those really old managers walk up to bat one day.",Happy
150,Yeah.  It would be even better if that old manager knocked it out of the park.  Babe Ruth didn't look like an athlete so why not?,Happy
150,So who did win the world series this year?  Was it Boston or another team?,Curious to dive deeper
150," The Sox.  They played the LA Dodgers.  I'm actually a Royals fan and it was a bad year.  As an aside, I had no idea Babe Ruth blew a World Series by getting caught stealing in 1926.  Say it ain't so Babe!",Surprised
150," He was an exceptional player, but he doesn't strike me as someone who was quick on his feet.  New York should be able to forgive him",Happy
150,I'm sure they have.  It's also hard to believe that the Cubs won back-to-back World Series games.  They have been mediocre for years.,Surprised
150," Guess all the curses are going away, there must be a statute of limitations on them.",Happy
150," Ha!  Yes, the ""Curse of the Bambino"" apparently was rescinded.  The Sox won last...",Happy
150," Nice talking with you, Go Royals!",Happy
151,Do you watch baseball much?,Curious to dive deeper
151,Yea I watch it during the world series when the AL champion faces off against the NL champion,Neutral
151," Nice I enjoy watching the world series, my favorite team is the Red Sox, they won it this year!",Curious to dive deeper
151," Yea, they've been pretty good, kinda crazy the NY Giants refused to play them in the 1904 world series",Surprised
151," wow, I did not know that. Did you know the red sox have lost every game on ben afflecks birthday since 1997",Curious to dive deeper
151," No, I guess Ben Afflecks birthday is bad luck for the Red Sox",Neutral
151,I guess so lol! Do you ever collect baseball cards?,Curious to dive deeper
151,Yea but I never found 3 million dollars worth of cards in an attic before,Neutral
151," Me too lol, talk about retiring early, wow! I wonder what cards he found in there. Maybe a babe ruth?",Curious to dive deeper
151,Possibly. It's crazy Ruth ended game 7 trying to steal home in the 1926 World Series,Surprised
151," wow, talk about ruining it for your team! Was he a yankee at the time or a red sox, I can't remember",Curious to dive deeper
151,Had to be a yankee since Ruth was playing in the 1926 world series,Neutral
151," true, lol duh! Do you know why baseball managers wear uniforms?",Curious to dive deeper
151," Because the manager can technically play in the game, I know Pete Rose did a few times as manager",Neutral
151," wow, that makes sense! I played semi pro and my manager jumped in a couple times, he was like 50 at the time!",Curious to dive deeper
151,That's pretty crazy. Do you know up until 2005 the MLB schedules were done by a married couple?,Curious to dive deeper
151," What do you mean, they went to the games until then or they created the schedules?",Curious to dive deeper
151,They would make the schedule for all 2430 mlb games,Neutral
151,wow that would be so crazy and intense. I would like to be part of that though some day. I wonder who makes  them now. Good chatting with you!,Curious to dive deeper
151," Nice chatting with you too, I think I'm gonna try to look for old baseball cards in my attic",Neutral
151," Me too lol, or my grandpas, bye!",Curious to dive deeper
152,Do you like dogs?,Curious to dive deeper
152," Yes, I do.  What's your favorite breed?",Surprised
152,I'm more of a cat person. I was surprised to read there are 12 different dog blood types and that they can donate blood to eachother. Pretty cool.,Surprised
152," That is cool. Dogs are not colour blind, but cannot see as many different colours as humans",Curious to dive deeper
152,That's interesting. Google's code of conduct mentions that they are a dog company!,Surprised
152," Haha, yeah.  Me too!",Curious to dive deeper
152,Dogs and elephants are the only animals that seem to instinctively understand pointing.,Surprised
152,That's neat.  Istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for the city's stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles.,Curious to dive deeper
152," Wow, that's awesome. The dog was the first species to be domesticated.",Neutral
152,A critical step in creation of wi-fi was a byproduct of research into improving astronomy imaging,Surprised
152,Interesting! Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena.,Neutral
152," Bill nye the science guy is the executive director of the planetary society, an astronomy organization founded by the great carl sagan.",Neutral
152,That's neat! Saadat shahr is a small rural community in iran nicknamed 'Astronomy Town' because of the residents' passion for stargazing.,Surprised
152,That's cool.  Didn't realize that.,Curious to dive deeper
152," Yeah, the town clubbed together to pay for an observatory and on special occasions all the lights are cut to improve the view of the night sky.",Surprised
152,The fda burned six tons of literature in an act of us censorship,Surprised
152,That's a shame. There is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel.,Surprised
152," In 1953 sir winston churchill won a nobel prize, and it was in literature, not peace.",Curious to dive deeper
152,I didn't know that. Literature was an olympic event from 1912 until 1952!,Surprised
152," Architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture were olympic events from 1912 until 1952.",Neutral
152," I learned a lot, Thanks for chatting! ",Happy
153,Do you like Baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
153," I do, I watch mainly during the world series times though",Neutral
153," Same here, I rooted for LA since I am from Cali.  But Boston is good too.",Curious to dive deeper
153,I always rooted for Atlanta growing up.  They were a lot more dominant then.,Neutral
153,I rooted for the A's.  That was crazy when the A's played the SF Giants and we had the Earthquake here.  We won and got that Commisioners Trophy!,Curious to dive deeper
153," Wow, an earthquake during a game?  ",Surprised
153,Yep.  The big one where a section of the Bay Bridge collapsed and the Marina District caught on fire.  The game was suspended for a few days but I think A's won it 4 of 4 out of 7 games possible.,Curious to dive deeper
153," Wow.  Thats crazy.  Im from Florida, so we have hurricanes, but we have quite a bit more warning.  lol",Neutral
153,Did you know the baseball coaches wear uniforms because they can actually play if needed lol.,Curious to dive deeper
153," Yeah, I wonder if they ever needed to step in, or it is just a tradition.",Neutral
153,I think it is in the rule book.  It is called America's pastime but I dont know....seems like there are more NFL and NBA fans at least out here.,Curious to dive deeper
153,It does seem that way around here too.  Baseball is actually really popular in Japan.,Neutral
153,I heard that often...what is weird is why Kickball is called Soccer-Baseball in canada?,Surprised
153," It kinda makes since you kick it and operate like baseball, but seems clunky as a name, in my opinion",Neutral
153,I guess a leg subs for the bat lol.,Surprised
153,Yeah.  Did you know that the albuquerque isotopes are named after the team in the Simpsons?,Neutral
153," Smart, use a team already branded by one of the longest running shows in history.  ",Surprised
153,It would help sell merch.  people would want some because of the show.,Neutral
153," I don't think anyone will copy the Red Sox name, they have had it since 1901!",Curious to dive deeper
153,Thats a long time.  I heard they started wearing red socks after the team the red stockings dropped red from their uniform.,Neutral
153,I might have to watch a little baseball this season now lol.. take care,Happy
153,You too!  Good chat!,Neutral
154," Hi! Are you a fan of baseball, got any favorite sports teams?",Curious to dive deeper
154," I like baseball, but I don't really have a favorite team. Do you?",Neutral
154," Don't have a favorite team either but my friends are huge Red Sox fans not sure if it's because they have gone on to win nine world series championships or what but with those stats, seems like a great accomplishment.",Surprised
154,Well they have an amazing performance. Did you know Lebron James partly own the boston red sox?,Neutral
154," Oh really? I didn't know that, that must be a great investment! Lots of fans have superstitions surrounding games, do you have any? ",Curious to dive deeper
154,Indeed. Do you like the mlb?,Neutral
154," Not really, the only player I'm familiar with is Babe Ruth who was caught stealing to end the game and lose the world series in 1926.",Surprised
154," Well it has its pros and cons. After a 17yr old female pitcher struck out babe ruth and lou gehrig, she was banned from pro baseball",Neutral
154," I wonder how that banning action would fare in today's world and society, you think it would receive negative press?",Curious to dive deeper
154,I think it would. Most men sports leagues don't outright ban females. They usually just have very difficult requirement to meet for females like the nfl,Neutral
154," Oh yeah, I heard about that. I wonder if thee were collectible cards and females did make it to play on the male dominant teams, would the cards be as valuable as other cards or extra valuable, like a man found three million dollars worth of cards in his grandfathers attic!",Surprised
154,I guess attics are treasure troves,Neutral
154," For some, unless its the attic of a hoarder. I wonder whether other sports team have requirements like baseball managers where they have to wear the uniforms because they have to play if the need arises.",Curious to dive deeper
154,I still haven't seen the manager ever play. Are managers bench players?,Neutral
154," Don't think so, but some of those managers aren't in great shape to be playing on the fields, if anything, they should just forfeit the game to save the managers from embarrassment. ",Surprised
154," True. i was surprised that if a player catches a ball in their hat, the opposing team gets 3 bases",Neutral
154," Yeah, I have yet to see that happen on tv nor have seen anyone attempt to do that. In Japan, baseball is also considered one of its national past time by how popular it is there.",Surprised
154,I personally don't find watching baseball games to be entertaining although I do enjoy baseball. Games here are fundamental different in atmosphere as asia,Neutral
154," Yeah, when you have much more physical games like football and basketball, baseball and even golf can be quite boring. Even the broadcasting of the World Series is boring to me unless the marine corps did something like they did in 1992 world series where they carried the Canada Flag into the stadium and it was upside down!",Surprised
154,I wonder if it would be more exciting if the dodgers finally win a world series champion. they have more losses than any other team,Neutral
154,It sure has been a while since the Dodgers won. Have a good day,Neutral
155," Hi, how are you?",Happy
155,Hi! Good!,Happy
155,Do you enjoy baseball?,Happy
155," I do like baseball, but I don't really follow it. How about you?",Happy
155,I love it. Watch a lot of games every year and can't wait until spring training... Babe ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 world series with his team down by one run.,Happy
155," Wow, that's awesome! Who is your favorite Baseball team? I like my Az team lol",Happy
155,Chicago Cubs. I'm from Chicago so... Love going to Wrigley!,Happy
155," O wow, that must be fantastic! I also like the Boston Red Sox, did you know the new york times has partial ownership?",Happy
155,I did. Baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises,Surprised
155,Cool and smart! The Red Sox have won 9 world series games!,Surprised
155," That's a lot! Up until 2005, a married couple, for 24 years, scheduled all 2430 major league baseball games played each year",Happy
155," Really! That is a lot, crazy! I didn't know that in Canada kickball is also called soccer-baseball, interesting!",Surprised
155,A man found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic- hidden since the 1940s.,Happy
155," Whoa, what a lucky find that was! Did you know the Chicago Cubs were the 1st to win back to back world series....but haven't won since....but I bet you know that!",Surprised
155,I did. And they won in 2016 so that/s inaccurate. But it's not your fault... You've been great!,Happy
155," Ohh, haha sorry....So in 1992 world series the US Marine corps color guard carried the Canada flag into the stadium upside down! nuts!",Surprised
155,WHAT? That's a lot disrespectful. Crazy...,Surprised
155,Right! I don't know if that was a mistake or not....,Surprised
155,I hope it was... At least it wasn't on national TV...,Happy
155,I hope not too! Gotta love the world series!,Surprised
155,Nice chatting with you.,Happy
155,Great chatting with you too! Have a good one!,Happy
155,You too,Happy
156," Hey, you a fan of any sports involving hitting balls with sticks?",Curious to dive deeper
156,Many such games fit that description.   Golf is one I enjoy.,Happy
156," I like golf a lot. It's a real shame how much water is wasted per day on each course, though. It's over 300,000 gallons a day a course!",Happy
156," True, but consider that golf courses in America combined are larger than the size of two small US states!",Surprised
156," Yeah, golf must be pretty popular in that case. Did you know there exists a golf course in Dubai that uses around 4 million gallons a day? That must cost a lot of money.",Neutral
156,I suppose that comes with games that cannot and do not utilize a standardized playing area,Happy
156,You know what games do utilize a standardized playing area? Baseball and softball. The fields are pretty similar.,Neutral
156,Interesting.    Babe Ruth was both a famous golfer and baseball player!,Surprised
156," Speaking of famous people who play sports, Samuel L. Jackson actually plays golf twice a week during filming of whatever he's in.",Curious to dive deeper
156,Cool.    Did you know Jose canseco claims to hold the record for longest softball homerun at 622 feet,Surprised
156," Woah, that's really far! Softball players don't make a lot of money. It's usually between $5,000 and $6,000.",Surprised
156," Well, what do you expect with a game invented at the YMCA?",Happy
156," Softball may have been invented at the YMCA, but it's pretty much a lesser baseball, which is America's national pastime. ",Neutral
156," Someone asked me about points in baseball, and I had to explain they are runs!",Surprised
156," Yeah, golf uses points called strokes though. Unlike baseball, less is more in golf.",Neutral
156," Funny how things get named - like golf uses clubs, but baseball uses a bat.",Happy
156,Softball uses a bat as well.,Neutral
156,True.    I wonder if they called it that when they used an actual soft ball.,Surprised
156,I wonder if the fact that the game used to use a soft ball but now uses a hard ball has any influence on the records.,Curious to dive deeper
156," It probably does, although more important is that softball started as an indoor sport.",Surprised
156," That is pretty important, but it's usually played outside nowadays. Baseball started outdoor and remained outdoor.",Neutral
156," Probably for the best, although I wouldn't want to be outside for a 31 inning game!     Thanks for the chat!",Surprised
157,How's it going? Do you like sports?,Curious to dive deeper
157,Pretty good.  You?  I do like sports.  I'm glad baseball season is about to start back up!,Neutral
157,Did you know there is a golf course in Dubai that requires 4 million gallons of water a day? Seems like such a needless waste.,Curious to dive deeper
157,No I didn't but I totally agree with you.  I guess Dubai is in a desert region so they need a lot of water to keep the grass green but it still seems wrong just to play golf on it.,Neutral
157," Even the ones in the US only use 312k gallons a day, which is no small amount, but is much less than that one single course.",Curious to dive deeper
157,Isn't Dubai mostly for the wealthy?  That could explain the excess.,Neutral
157,It actually is not even as wealthy as New York or London. It is only marketed to seem very wealthy when in reality it isn't all that much. Abu Dhabi is actually the most wealthy city in the world.,Curious to dive deeper
157," I didn't know that! I always thought it was Dubai. It looks like I've believed the hype.  Speaking of hype, did you know that Babe Ruth was one our most famous golfers?",Neutral
157,He must have been much better than Micheal Jordan haha. Did you know Samuel L Jackson puts a golf clause in his contracts that allows him to play golf twice a week during production of a movie? He must really love golf.,Curious to dive deeper
157,He really must and people must love him to allow it in his contracts!,Neutral
157,Did you know kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada? That's kind of weird.,Curious to dive deeper
157,It does sound weird.   Did you know that the ymca invented softball?,Neutral
157," They also invented volleyball,softball and basketball. I find it hard to believe the basketball one though, pretty sure it was around before the YMCA, I could be wrong though.",Curious to dive deeper
157,I don't know. I heard somewhere that James Naismith invented basketball.  I'm not sure if he was with the ymca or not.,Neutral
157," A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in his grandfathers attic, talk about a stroke of luck!",Curious to dive deeper
157," That is lucky!  You know, I've heard that baseball is super popular in Japan.  Over there they are surprised to learn it's our national pastime.",Neutral
157," Man as of 2014 the average salary for a pro softball player was between 5,000 and 6,000, does not sound like a good sport to become a pro in.",Curious to dive deeper
157,No it really doesn't.  It's odd that's it's so low considering softball was the first sport shown on espn.,Neutral
157," Well i would say soccer is probably the best sport to go pro in because they make more money than basketball,football,and golf combined.",Curious to dive deeper
157," I agree.  speaking of softball though, did you know that the longest game in college history lasted 31 innings?",Neutral
157,Wow that is crazy long. Well it was nice chatting with you. Have a good day.,Happy
158,Good morning!  Do you watch baseball?  It can be a lucrative thing to be a fan of the game.  A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards once.,Neutral
158,I am a baseball fan. I used to collect cards but I really doubt mine are worth 3 million dollars.,Surprised
158,After hearing about that man I wish I had collected them.  The ones he found though were from the 1900s.  They had been stashed away since the 1940s.,Neutral
158," I could only imagine how exciting that was. My cards were from the late 1980s and 1990s, there were a lot of sets made then. I bet there were a lot less made in the 1900s.",Surprised
158,I don't know actually.  The weird thing about baseball is that it's america's national pastime but it is super popular in Japan of all places.,Neutral
158,I know that a few countries in Asia have really taken up baseball. A lot of former MLB players play in Korea as well.,Neutral
158,I've heard that before.  Japan likes it so much that they are actually shocked to learn that it comes from america.,Neutral
158,That surprises me because after World War 2 they have become a lot more open to Western culture and adopting some of our styles and customs.,Surprised
158," It is surprising.  Speaking of surprising, did you know that the reason the managers wear uniforms is so they can go in the game if needed?",Neutral
158,In previous years some players played a dual role as a manager as well. Now I don't think most managers would be able to last in the game.,Curious to dive deeper
158," True, some of them look a bit out of practice.  What do you think of softball?  I didn't know it was invented by the ymca.",Neutral
158," I did not know that either. I enjoy playing softball, it is a lot more fun to play recreationally than baseball.",Happy
158,i like playing too.  What i learned recently was that it was originally invented as an indoor game though. I never knew that before!,Neutral
158," I can't imagine it as an indoor game, that seems more like wiffleball to me.",Surprised
158," It does seem odd.  You know, it's supposed to be a faster game than regular baseball and yet the longest softball game in history went for 31 innings.  That is a long game!",Neutral
158," Any league I've played in always had rules to prevent that from happening! I couldn't imagine being involved for 31 innings, that's almost 3 baseball games.",Surprised
158,I imagine it was pretty tiring for everyone.  Softball really doesn't get as much respect as baseball even with that super long game.  Professional players only make around 5 or 6 thousand dollars a year.,Neutral
158," It's really hard to turn your sport into a major force in the US. With the popularity of the NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL, they dominate the sports scene.",Neutral
158,They definitely do at that.  It's sad to think about it though because the game has been around since 1887.,Neutral
158,At least the YMCA created basketball and therefore one of the major sports leagues around today. Not bad for a recreational game they thought up.,Happy
158,True. They invented volleyball too.,Neutral
159,hi how are you? do you like sports?,Neutral
159," I'm doing very well, thanks. I love sports",Happy
159,do you like golf? i have never played golf.,Neutral
159,I love golf. Its a great sport where individual players hit balls with clubs into a series of holes on a golf course in as few strokes as possible.,Curious to dive deeper
159,I never played because it looked expensive. How long have you played?,Neutral
159,I have been playing for about 10 years now and another thing I wanted to mention that the golf course consists of 18 holes but if you play the game for fun its usually 9 holes.,Curious to dive deeper
159," Ok, but doesnt it cost a lot for the equipment and the greens fees and stuff?",Neutral
159,Well that depends on the equipment you buy and also where you play.,Neutral
159,I guess i would want the cheapest stuff. i played sports with minimal equipment growing up.,Neutral
159," The gold course requires a lot of water to maintain about 312,000 gallons in fact per day.",Curious to dive deeper
159," That sounds like quite a bit. it is ok in some places, but maybe where water is scarce, it is not ideal.",Neutral
159," This is just the average for American golf courses. I read somewhere that a golf course in Dubai requires 4,000,000 gallons of water per day to maintain.",Curious to dive deeper
159," That is insane. in a desert country? it seems excessive, but i guess that the rich have the money for that kind of hobby.",Neutral
159,I agree. Do you know any famous baseball player that is also a very famous golfer?,Neutral
159,Is this a recent player? i know that a lot of them play gofl.,Neutral
159,No this baseball player was back in the 1920s.,Neutral
159,The babe? Did he play golf? He could hit a ball pretty fall.,Neutral
159," You guessed it correctly. Babe Ruth, he was a fantastic baseball player and at one point America's most famous golfer.",Happy
159," That is amazing. he was a big fellow though. i bet he could drive it pretty far. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
159,Yes he was. It was nice chatting with you as well. Have a nice night!!!,Happy
159,You too! Have a nice weekend!,Neutral
159,you have a nice weekend as well.,Happy
159,Thanks!,Neutral
159,Bye!!!,Neutral
160,Do you watch the show Fixer Upper?,Curious to dive deeper
160," Hello, I do. What about you?",Curious to dive deeper
160,I have yes. They are having another baby,Surprised
160,That's pretty cool. Do you like attending concerts?,Curious to dive deeper
160,I do. I would love to go to a show at an old roman amphitheater,Neutral
160,That would be very cool to see. Did you know Linkin Park played 324 concerts back in 2001?,Surprised
160,Thats a lot of shows. They were very popular when they first hit the scene,Surprised
160,I agree. I love Linkin Park. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
160,I do as well. Sad about chester,Sad
160,I agree. Such a waste of talent to go out like that.,Sad
160,Just like the waste during a 2002 concert. Creed was sued because it was so bad,Neutral
160,That's funny they were sued. I bet it was very bad.,Surprised
160,Are there any artist that you would like to see live?,Curious to dive deeper
160,I would love to see Pink Floyd. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
160,Eminem is on my bucket list. He made kanye rewrite his part in a song after hearing eminems verse,Neutral
160,It would be very cool to see Eminem. The Ramones played 2263 concerts in 20 years.,Surprised
160,That must of taken a toll on them. 20 years non stop,Curious to dive deeper
160,I bet. Do you like Drake?,Curious to dive deeper
160,He is ok. Makes good club music,Neutral
160,I agree. Not music I would listen to on a daily basis.,Neutral
160,Did you know he didnt graduate high school until 25?,Surprised
160," I did not know that. Very interesting. Well, it was good chatting with you.",Happy
161," Hello, do you like Drake as a singer?",Curious to dive deeper
161," Hey there, yes he is okay. Do you know his real name?",Curious to dive deeper
161,Yes it is Aubrey Drake Graham and he is a Canadian,Curious to dive deeper
161,Yes he is. He graduate high school at 25,Curious to dive deeper
161,Better late than never I guess. He also seems to be a lot into kids books like winnie the phooh and charlotte's web,Curious to dive deeper
161,Yeah I wonder who it was for though. Did you know the beat from hotline bling is sampled?,Curious to dive deeper
161,Oh yeah heard that it was sampled from Why we can't live together of TImmy THomas,Curious to dive deeper
161," Yeah pretty cool, that song was out before Drake was born back in 1972",Curious to dive deeper
161,Yeah exactly. Once he visited Drake University in the middle of the night when the students did not expect it,Curious to dive deeper
161,Wow that must have been awesome for them. Do you go to concerts much?,Curious to dive deeper
161," I do from time to time. In 2001 Linkin Park played 324 concerts alone, mind blowing",Curious to dive deeper
161,When did they rest? Wow that is pretty amazing. THe Ramon toured for 20 years too,Curious to dive deeper
161," Right, and they played a staggering 2263 concerts during that time",Curious to dive deeper
161," WOw, those guys honestly. In Craotia there is an ancient theater that is still used for concerts",Curious to dive deeper
161,Hmm sounds like the one PInk FLoyd used in Pompeii for a concert without an audience,Curious to dive deeper
161," What a waste, I would have liked to be there for sure. Creed concerts was really bad though that they got sued",Curious to dive deeper
161,Wow must have been really bad then. DO you ever shop at target?,Curious to dive deeper
161,Yes quite a bit. They will match Amazon prices so it makes it a good place to shop,Curious to dive deeper
161,Nice I did not know that. There is no Target in Vermont though,Curious to dive deeper
161,SO I guess they have to stick with Amazon. And they do not carry tobacco products since 19,Curious to dive deeper
161,Hmm so I guess not a good spot for smokers either,Happy
162,do you go to concerts?,Curious to dive deeper
162," I go when I can, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
162,Me too. Did you know Linkin Park played 324 concerts in 2001?,Curious to dive deeper
162,Wow that is amazing. How did they have time to rest?,Curious to dive deeper
162,Exactly. The ramones also toured for 20 years straight,Curious to dive deeper
162,WOw that is amazing. Did you know ABBA turned down an offer to have a reunion?,Curious to dive deeper
162," Yeah they played 2263 concerts during that time. They did, why?",Curious to dive deeper
162," Wow amazing. Yes, they turned down a $1 billion offer",Curious to dive deeper
162,WOw. A Creed concert was really bad that people sued them once,Curious to dive deeper
162,That is too bad. DO you like Drake?,Curious to dive deeper
162,I like him somewhat. Do you know when he graduated high school?,Curious to dive deeper
162," Hmm I am not sure actually, was it recent?",Curious to dive deeper
162," Yes pretty recent, it was in 2012 when he was 25",Curious to dive deeper
162," Yeah better late than never I guess for him, he was busy otherwise",Curious to dive deeper
162,True . DO you know his real name or full name?,Curious to dive deeper
162,Yes his name is Aubrey Drake Graham and he is Canadian,Curious to dive deeper
162,Yeah. Did you know the beat for Hotline Bling is sampled?,Curious to dive deeper
162," Did not know that, from which song?",Curious to dive deeper
162,It is the song WHy can;t we live together?,Curious to dive deeper
162,Nice. Did you know he was in Degrassi?,Curious to dive deeper
162," Did not know that, pretty cool an actor as well. Nice chatting with you",Curious to dive deeper
162," Same here, have a good one.",Happy
163," Hello there, do you attend many concerts these days?",Curious to dive deeper
163," Nope. More of a TV watcher. But know a little about the fabulously successful rapper, Drake Graham, or Drake, from Canada. Heard of him?",Curious to dive deeper
163," Yeah I have heard of him, he has made some good songs.  Do you know what age he graduated high school?",Curious to dive deeper
163," They say age 25. I'm guessing that he may have received a GED.  He's been in show business, first, a TV series called Degrassi: The Next Generation, ever since Drake was a 14 year old. Maybe dropped out of school in about 9th grade?",Curious to dive deeper
163," Yeah what I think is that he started so young he didn't have time to finish, but eventually did a GED type program.  I'm sure he is more than smart enough. ",Curious to dive deeper
163," Absolutely. I'd say the guy found his calling in the music industry, especially rap. He's also written songs, produced albums and become a savvy entrepreneur, they say. Not just your average Next Generation kid!",Curious to dive deeper
163," No, he is not, I know he has won multiple grammys as well!",Curious to dive deeper
163," Yes, earned his 2st Grammy in 2011, and has earned more for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Album.",Neutral
163,That is very impressive.  Did you know he once sampled a Timmy Thomas hit?,Curious to dive deeper
163," No. As I mentioned, I'm more of a TV watcher. Although I'm not into reality TV much, one show I'll miss that's recently concluded after 5 seasons on HGTV is Fixer Upper. Ever see it?",Curious to dive deeper
163," No thats not one that I have seen before, is it pretty good?",Curious to dive deeper
163," It was, actually. Chip and Joanna Gaines, a conservative evangelical couple from Texas, who did not impose their religious beliefs on TV audiences, but were clearly sincere down-home folks, took houses needed fixing and turned them into dream homes for clients. It was heartwarming, and the couple were fun-loving.",Curious to dive deeper
163," That sounds pretty entertaining, I might have to check it out when I can. ",Curious to dive deeper
163," You'll have to catch back episodes from their 5 seasons (2013 to 2018). Recently they welcomed their 5th child, and ended the show, they said, to put their family 1st again. There's a whole genre of fix-up shows, PBS, on TV today. Who knew?",Curious to dive deeper
163," Well I can respect them making that decision, I'm sure it's best for their family. ",Curious to dive deeper
163," Agreed. Sorry, I meant to say that there's a whole genre of fix-it shows, all of which stem from This Old House, now on PBS, on several networks, including HGTV, today.",Curious to dive deeper
163," Oh ok, yeah I think I have heard of some of those shows before as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
163," If you want to see more of the Gaines couples work, they're written best-selling books and have a home goods line featured at Target stores. Have a Target reasonably close to you? Do you shop there?",Curious to dive deeper
163," Yeah we do have a Target in town, I think I will check that out, thanks!",Curious to dive deeper
163," I know Target well because I witnessed their growth from one location in the Roseville Shopping Center in the suburban Twin Cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, MN to Target becoming the 8th-largest US retail department store today. Ever heard about Target's history?",Neutral
163," No, I can't say I know a whole lot about that.  But, it's been nice chatting with you today, I hope you have a good day!",Happy
164," I am sure that you know that Black Panther is a Marvel Comics character, right?",Curious to dive deeper
164,The richest superhero. Worth $500 billion.,Fearful
164,That's the one!  The origins of the script for the movie date back to the 4th century.,Neutral
164,The character was not named after the black panther party.,Sad
164,No.  LOL.  Caught me off guard with that.  The old script was written in Nigeria.,Neutral
164,Chadwick Boseman played the character Black Panther.,Happy
164,The film was sure a block buster.  Apparently Denzel Washington helped him get his education.,Neutral
164,Supporting his training at Oxford.,Fearful
164," I see.  To change the subject, did you know that over 80 of the earth's forest have been destroyed in the history of our planet?",Neutral
164,I believe it. We need the land for farming and people want the lumber.,Disgusted
164," Yes.  I heard that when the Europeans discovered North America, a squirrel could go from coast to coast without touching the ground. Now we expect to have no helium left on earth is less than 82 years.",Neutral
164,I wonder if the aliens will need the helium when they finally settle on our planet. The UN now has an ambassador for extraterrestrials.,Disgusted
164," Unless there really is ""warp speed"" I think it will take aliens too long to get here.  I did hear about that ambassador being appointed in 2010.",Neutral
164,The earth covered mostly with water in the form of oceans. I think that the aliens might want our planet for the water.,Sad
164," Could be.  But if they don't have any they won't know that they find it useful.  Fortunately for sea levels, both of our poles are covered with ice.",Neutral
164,Do you read non-fiction? It's fascinating stuff.,Surprised
164," I have read quite a bit.  I like Grisham and Clancy.  But I also like the best selling non-fiction book, the Bible.",Neutral
164," Jack London lived as a poor person in London, and wrote a book about it.",Fearful
164,It is hard to write about things one has not experienced.  That is why Grisham's books are about the law.  George W Bush reading 14 biographies of Lincoln is a person trying hard to do well.,Neutral
164,He also read a lot of nonfiction. Good way to get an education. No need for school.,Happy
164,I agree.  Education should continue through one's life.  Who would have thought that one of only 8 people to have both a fiction and non-fiction best seller would be a country singer?,Neutral
164," A man of many talents! Well, I enjoyed chatting!",Happy
164," Me too, nice chat.",Neutral
165," Hello there, did you see the Black Panther film that was recently in theaters?",Curious to dive deeper
165," Yea, I think Chawick Boseman did a great job as T'Challa",Neutral
165,I have yet to see the movie but I heard that he did a really good job as well.,Curious to dive deeper
165,Ryan Coogler did an awesome job directing Black Panther and Michael B Jordan was good too,Neutral
165,I heard the same thing.  I guess the black panther is the richest superhero there is as well.,Curious to dive deeper
165," Yea, apparently Black Panther is worth more than Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne combined",Neutral
165,That is crazy! I never knew there was one that had more money than those guys.,Curious to dive deeper
165," Yea, in the comics Black Panther is worth 500 billion dollars",Neutral
165,Did you know that some of the symbols and written scripts used in the movie were based on actual script dating back to the 4th century?,Curious to dive deeper
165," Yea, based on Nsibdi from the Nigeria region",Neutral
165," I think that is very cool, I always like it when those types of movies use actual history references. ",Curious to dive deeper
165," Yea but it's unfortunate that they censored the phrase ""praise hanuman"" from the indian release of Black Panther",Neutral
165," That sounds really stupid to me, that overly pc stuff has gotten a bit too much for me. ",Curious to dive deeper
165,The Indians weren't happy they censored it either and thought it was empowering rather than insulting,Neutral
165,Yeah and I don't blame them for feeling that way to be honest.,Curious to dive deeper
165," Yea people can be sensitive over trivial stuff instead of important things, like 80% of natural forests being destroyed",Neutral
165," Exactly, that is so alarming and people are more concerned with silly stuff. ",Curious to dive deeper
165,Yea like the UN appointing an official ambassador to extraterrestrials,Angry
165," That too, I wonder how much the salary is for that job?",Curious to dive deeper
165," Too much, I'm pretty worried the earth will be helium free by the end of the century",Fearful
165," Yeah I wonder what all the party balloon companies will do to survive.  Anyways, it's been nice talking with you, I hope you have a good day!",Happy
166,Hello. Its pretty cold today. It makes me wonder whether more of the earth's polar regions are covered with ice today.,Curious to dive deeper
166,I know it is freezing... in Chicago it is near -24. So cold!,Curious to dive deeper
166," Wow!! Its definitely a good day to stay in and catch some movies. Speaking of movies, Black Panther has the richest superhero out there, worth $500 billion!",Curious to dive deeper
166,That's a lot of money. They are re-releasing th emovie for free from February 1 - 7 for african american month...,Happy
166,Wow!! Thats amzinzing. I know there was a lot of confusion when the movie was first released...many people confused it with the black panther party.,Curious to dive deeper
166," Yeah, they are a lot different. T'challa is the richest superhero/",Curious to dive deeper
166," That's interesting! You know, there's a lot that we can do with this extra day off with the cold and all...we have the whole day to indulge. Did you know that when the Earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long?",Curious to dive deeper
166,I had no idea. I do know that I am working on this cold day and worked out this morning. It has been a cold day!,Curious to dive deeper
166," Yes it has. The weather and the earth's atmosphere is forever changing. By the 21st century, we anticipate running out of Helium. That's going to significantly impact human life...scary!!",Surprised
166,How is it going to impact humans> I am curious to know more!,Curious to dive deeper
166," Well, for one, Helium makes up a large portion of our atmosphere. I do know that. And Helium helps to keep things floating so I can only imagine the impact will be negative!",Fearful
166,Thanks for the insight. I had no idea!,Curious to dive deeper
166," I'm just thinking about how our atmosphere works... I', no expert but I think its safe to say that the absence of Helium could come at a high cost.",Fearful
166,I agree. I had no idea that it was that precious.,Curious to dive deeper
166,Yessss!! I guess we could gain more insight about what the future holds for humanity by reading the bible. Did you know that the bible is the biggest selling non-fiction book ever printed? That's pretty impressive!,Curious to dive deeper
166,I did. George W bush read 41 biographies of lincoln. That's crazy! I do not think Lincoln knew that much about himself.,Curious to dive deeper
166,That's funny!! And probably true!! He also read 186 historical nonfiction books!! That's a lot of knowledge!,Curious to dive deeper
166," Yeah, I can barely read and here he is showing off reading that much@",Happy
166,I hear ya!! Jack London lived as a poor down and out pauper and still managed to write a book about exposing the gap between the rich and the poor. So there's always hope!! Keep at your reading... and you'll get better!,Curious to dive deeper
166,I hope! I have written a lot so I hope it all comes together!,Curious to dive deeper
166," I do too!!! Well, its been good talking to you. I have to get going. Have a great day. Goodbye!",Happy
166,You too!,Happy
167," Hello, what kind of genre do you prefer in books?",Curious to dive deeper
167," I prefer non fiction.  Although in fiction, I like mystery and drama.  What authors do you like?",Neutral
167,I do not have a favorite author but I love the Harry Potter series.,Curious to dive deeper
167," I enjoyed the movie, Black Panther which was based on a Marvel Comics character.",Neutral
167,I love all the movies of Harry Potter too! I love Black Panther. WAKANDA FOREVER!,Curious to dive deeper
167,The director of Black Panther also co-wrote it.  He must have earned some bucks.,Neutral
167,I bet he earns a lot of money! That was a popular movie.,Curious to dive deeper
167,His name is Ryan Coogler.,Neutral
167,Ryan Coogler? It made me think of cougar,Curious to dive deeper
167,One woman got a role in the movie and began her acting career at age 88. That's old,Neutral
167,I agree. Unless she has that energy.,Curious to dive deeper
167," Marvel started a studio to do the film.  They borrowed money and put their other characters up as collateral.  If the studio had failed, Merril Lynch would have owned Captain America and others.",Neutral
167,I started liking Marvel after Spider Verse. That is crazy.,Curious to dive deeper
167," I grew up on DC comics, but Marvel has cut their own niche.  Denzel Washington helped Chadwick Boseman financially to study at Oxford 20 years ago.  That produced a great result.",Neutral
167,What is your favorite DC comic?,Curious to dive deeper
167,I prefer Superman but Justice League is a close second.  He can turn back time by circling the earth.  The earth is the densest of the 4 terrestrial planets.,Neutral
167,Have you watched Bumblebee?,Curious to dive deeper
167,I don't know what that is.  Enlighten me.,Curious to dive deeper
167,Have you heard of Transformers?,Curious to dive deeper
167,Of course.  They would certainly be in the genre of Sci-fi if they were in a book.,Neutral
167,Bumble bee is that one yellow robot. That movie is all about him.,Curious to dive deeper
167,I see.  Guess I will go now.,Neutral

168,good morning. I am a little bit of a fan. Are you a fan?,Neutral

168,I have watched a few episodes but I didn't follow it closely? How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
168," I've seen a few. I heard it beat out Seinfeld, Friends, and even Frasier for the best comedy award in 1997.",Neutral
168," That was a lot of great shows nominated at once. I watch a lot of Brooklyn Nine Nine now, I think that's one of the best shows on TV.",Happy
168,I've never seen it but I have seen the commercials and it looks funny.  You are right about all those great shows.  Sounds like there was a lot of good comedy back in 1997.,Neutral
168,It's definitely not the same these days as it was back then. I think the rise of cable prices has hurt how many people are watching TV.,Sad
168,Speaking of cable tv. What do you think of comedy central?,Neutral
168," I like Comedy Central, I haven't watched it as much lately because I have been watching Netflix and Amazon Prime more.",Neutral
168,Comedy Central may be very particular on how they do comedy.  I've heard they've canceled over 100 shows since they started back in 1989.,Neutral
168,That's a lot of shows to cancel. I know from watching Daniel Tosh's show he would reference a show they canceled quickly each week.,Surprised
168,Really?  I guess they are selective then.  i've never watched the channel. Do they do different types of comedy or just one?,Neutral
168,They have a lot of original programming so they broadcast a wide variety of comedy. They also air original stand up comedy specials as well.,Neutral
168,So have you ever seen ken jeong perform?,Neutral
168,I have not seen him perform his stand up yet. He just released a new special on Netflix. I have only seen him in movies and on TV.,Neutral
168," Yeah, i haven't seen him either.  I heard he used to be a doctor of some kind.",Neutral
168," Yes he was, it's a pretty interesting career transition from being a doctor to being an actor.",Surprised
168,Especially to a stand up comedian/actor.  I wonder what made him do it.,Neutral
168," He must have really felt the calling to it. It was fun chatting about comedy with you, have a great day!",Happy
169,Have you ever had a seizure? I can't believe that someone had a seizure at Ken Jeong's comedy show!,Surprised
169,I have never had one but i have seen people have them and yeah he thought it was a heckler thats pretty insane,Neutral
169,I know! Crazy! I would have probably though the same. They said he ran right over to the person!,Surprised
169,Yeah he was an internal medicine practitioner before he turned to comedy so he attended to the woman until medics arrived,Neutral
169,That is great. I heard that the audience members didn't even record this. Amazing!,Surprised
169,That is suprising considering how glued people are to their phones,Neutral
169,I agree. I just hope most people are happy with how he reacted. That can be crazy!,Neutral
169,I agree the audience met him with a round of applause when he returned to the stage.,Neutral
169," So, Did you even realize that Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989??",Curious to dive deeper
169,no I did not realize that why are they cancelling so many shows?,Neutral
169,Personally it feels like it because so many people are so sensitive now.,Neutral
169,I agree with that I think people are way too sensitive now.. I liked all the shows that used to be on like 3rd Rock form the Sun it won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997,Neutral
169,I loved 3rd rock!  Are you into comics at all? I am not but my boys are.,Curious to dive deeper
169,I am a huge super hero nerd lol... I love the avengers marvel or dc comics idc I like it all lol,Neutral
169,I don't know know that much about it. Have you heard about the generic comic book?,Curious to dive deeper
169,Yeah Marvel published it in order to trademark the names of the heroes and villians,Neutral
169,I had no idea what dc comics stands for?,Neutral
169,the dc stands for detective comics,Neutral
169,Oh! I get that. Did you know that the Michigan State U library has the largest publicly available comic book collection!?,Surprised
169,I did not know that... I know that there are some that sell for a pretty penny,Neutral
169,So good talking to you tonight!!,Neutral
170,Hi! Do you watch any comedy?,Curious to dive deeper
170,Sometimes. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
170," Yeah, though I have never seen any one perform live. Ken Jeong, the comedian is actually a licensed physician and even saved someone who had a seizure during his shows!",Surprised
170,Oh wow he is a real doctor? I thought that was just a bit for tv.,Surprised
170," He actually went to medical school and did residency to become licensed, but I'm guessing he makes way more as a famous comedian than as a physician, what do you think?",Curious to dive deeper
170,That is crazy to think we live in a society where being famous can pay more than people whos job it is to save lives.,Surprised
170," Yeah, like I remember reading that the actor who plays Dr. House gets paid more than $700K per episode! I'm thinking doctor's make about that in a year or something.",Surprised
170,Wow that is just crazy amounts of money. But look at the budget for movies like avengers. Billions of dollars.,Disgusted
170," Considering that Infinity War was the first film to ever be shot entirely with digital imax cameras, they probably needed that billion dollars.",Surprised
170,Probably. Have to admit it though it made for one heck of a movie.,Neutral
170," Yeah! Was it because of the script or the all-star cast which included Robert Downey, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Benedict Cumberbatch, Christ Pratt?",Curious to dive deeper
170,I think the script. They have taken actors that were only sort of known and really put them on the map with these amazing scripts.,Neutral
170," Yeah, I agree but what I'm wondering is what the movie has to do with increase in shawarma sales, do you have any idea, did I miss something from the movie?",Curious to dive deeper
170,It has caused that? That is awesome! There is a scene at the end of the battle in new york where they all go for shawarma and are chilling around this table. It is iconic in the avengers universe.,Surprised
170," Oh! I really did miss it, thanks for clarifying! Crazy to think how the voice actor who plays Jarvis has never seen any of the films! Wouldn't he be invited to the screening and stuff?",Curious to dive deeper
170,You would think. Isn't he the guy that plays vision now?,Curious to dive deeper
170," Oh really? I don't know, I'd have to read up on the books to know. Did you have read the comic books before watching the movies?",Curious to dive deeper
170,No I've never been much of a comic book reader. It sounds like there are some interesting storylines that could be turned into movies though.,Curious to dive deeper
170," Yeah, me neither but it sure opens your mind to endless creativity like the universe takes place in earth 199999 years ago and there's a multiverse too!",Surprised
170,Stan lee was a visionary. He will be so missed. I can't imagine not seeing his cameos in the coming movies.,Sad
170," Yeah exactly and who's going to end phone conversations with ""excelsior"" like he did.",Happy
171," Hello, are you a comedy fan?  Are you familiar with Ken Jeong's",Happy
171,Not really but I have heard of the show The Hangover. Some comics are really brutal and I don't like humor that hurts people.,Neutral
171,He is actually a Dr.  He studied at Duke University.,Happy
171,That is interesting. I wonder why he went from medicine to humor? It's a good thing because he saved the woman in the story.,Neutral
171," Yes, I heard about this awhile back.  A women was having a seizure.  He first thought she was a heckler.",Happy
171," Hecklers are not funny at all. I went to a comedy show where there were several and they ruined the whole performance. I don't think I could be a comedian you have to have a tough skin. He is good, though.",Happy
171," It is said that once he realized what was going on, he jumped off stage and into action.",Surprised
171,I suspect that the training never leaves you. I would rather be a doctor but I guess he does really well acting. Comedy is a lot of fun if you don't hurt other people with jokes.,Neutral
171,I'm sure he makes more as a comedian and actor.  After his actions he told the crowd that he checked her vitals and reassured the crowd.  They applaued him.,Happy
171," I like The Three Stooges type of humor. Or Mr. Bean. I just watched one of his movies and I laughed all the way through. He makes fun of himself, mostly. And it hurts no one. ",Neutral
171,Ken got his break in a comedy contest.  He then moved to LA and performed sets after long days in a HMO clinic.,Curious to dive deeper
171,That must have been difficult so he must have a real gift for comedy. I will have to check it out.'The empire strikes back'  was a comedy and I did not even know that. I need to keep up these movies.,Neutral
171," YOU SHOULD DO THAT.  DID YOU KNOW THAT BILL MURRAY THINKS ""KUNG FU HUSTLE"" IS THE SUPREME ACHIVEMENT IN COMEDY?",Surprised
171," I don't know Kung Foo Hustle. Bill Murray is funny, though. I remember him on Saturday Night Live. Now that was funny. Especially Gilda Radner and Chevy Chase.",Neutral
171,Bill Murray is an all time great.  I also saw that the Green Lantern movie was originally going to be a comedy with Jack Black.,Surprised
171,The Greeks invented comedy as part of a dramatic performance. I would like to go back and see how funny they were compared to today's comedians.,Neutral
171," I didn't know that.  Speaking of comedy and movies, The Avengers movie ""Infinity War"" was the first movie shot completely with digital imax cameras ",Curious to dive deeper
171," That's another one I haven't seen. That's is interesting, though. I like the raven's names Hugin and Munin.",Neutral
171," I am a huge comic book fan.  Lou Ferrifno, who played the Hulk in the original 1670's tv show has voiced him dor everything up until Avengers Age of Ultron",Surprised
171,There were a lot of big starts doing the voices in the Avengers.  I like the Hulk. I always felt sorry for his character.,Neutral
171," Yes, he is kind of sad.  Well have a Merry Christmas.",Neutral
172,Good Morning! Have you ever heard of K-Pop?,Curious to dive deeper
172," K-pop is the music which is originated in South Korea, they are more popular in 2000.",Happy
172,I like how South Korea blasted K-Pop across the border to North Korea in 2010.,Happy
172," The north korea sank a south korean warship in 2010, south korea responded by blasting the k-pop song ""hit your heart"" across the border using large military loud speakers.",Happy
172,I bet that was very annoying to listen to all day and night! Did you know even Jackie Chan manages a K-Pop boy band?,Happy
172," Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, to make the movement repeat and well organised.",Happy
172," Speaking of choreography, ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shows a week!",Happy
172,Ballet dance is originated in Italian Renaissance in the 15th century and it become concert dance in France and Russia.,Happy
172," I think it is cool that it's still around to this day. Michael Jackson has some patents on some of his dance moves, crazy!",Happy
172,Dance is also represent the culture and traditional of particular region. Mostly it make our body well control and organised.,Happy
172,Even Tupac dance ballet in high school and performed in the production of the nutcracker.,Surprised
172,Babies are dances immediately when they hear music and make their body very flexible.,Happy
172,I think it's crazy how babies can do that. I can't believe Bruce Lee was a dancer and was even in a dance championship in 1958!,Surprised
172," It is very interesting. Dance is art, sometime other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have dance like quality, including martial arts and physical activity.",Happy
172," That is an awesome type of art! I think birds are a type of art as well, especially hummingbirds that steal spider webs for their own nests.",Surprised
172,Birds are living world wide and there are more than ten thousand spices world wide. Birds have wings which developed more or less according to their species.,Happy
172," That is a lot of species! In most birds, their skeleton weighs less than their feathers!",Surprised
172,So only it make to fly very high and far away. Some times birds travel from one continent to another continent for their breed.,Happy
172,They even go without sleeping during the migration!,Surprised
172,Yeah. They no need of visa and other formalities.,Surprised
172,They really don't huh? Have a good day!,Happy
173," Hi, how are you?",Happy
173,Good. I learned a few fun facts. Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer as well as kung fu star and won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha championship in 1958.,Curious to dive deeper
173," That's cool,never would have pictured him doing the Cha Cha but it takes the same skills probably to perform Kung Fu.",Surprised
173," Other stars you would not expect, Tupac danced ballet and was the Mouse King in his high school production of the Nutcracker.",Surprised
173," Wow, Tupac?  You must be pulling my leg!  Never could he be a ballet dancer.  Wow!",Surprised
173,I know but creative people are drawn to the arts. Just like how babies are drawn to music. They will spontaneously dance when they hear music and smile when they hit the beat.,Happy
173," Speaking of ballet, did you know that ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week?",Surprised
173,That is a lot of shoes. They must need it for all the extreme moves they perform. Kind of like Michael Jackson's extreme lean that he has a patent on.,Surprised
173,You're probably right!,Surprised
173,Some birds are so beautiful it is almost like they are dancing in flight. Hummingbirds are some of my favorites. Did you know they steal spiderwebs to build their nests?,Happy
173," Yes, birds are amazing.  Their bones are so hollow the fearthers weigh more than their skeletons.",Curious to dive deeper
173,That is fascinating. Some birds migrate from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping!,Surprised
173," I wouldn't make a good bird!  Couldn't do that, at all.",Fearful
173,Me either. I sometimes worry I would be like a dodo bird. They are in a sub-family of pigeon.,Neutral
173," Lol, didn't know that!  I read some wild Australian birds can mimic sounds like chainsaws and car alarms!",Curious to dive deeper
173,I find birds fascinating. They evolved wings and yet some lost the ability to fly like penguins. And then there are others that lived near water that became great at swimming.,Curious to dive deeper
173," If I was a bird, I hope I would have enough smarts to evolve to thrive in my environment.  Our poor birds today are struggling.  I've watched Canadian Geese all winter try to figure out when to head back North, only to hit a blizzard and have to turn around and fly back South.  It's sad.",Fearful
173,It is sad. They are such a great indicator species of our environment. Everything from the smallest 2 inch hummingbird to the 9 foot ostrich.,Curious to dive deeper
173," On a different note, have you ever heard of K pop?",Curious to dive deeper
173,I have and I was shocked to find out that Jackie Chan manages a k-pop boy band.,Surprised
173," Wow, didn't know that about Jackie. Well, it's been nice chatting this morning.  Have a good Friday.",Curious to dive deeper
174,Do you like dogs?,Surprised
174," I do, Im a dog person, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
174,I like them though I don't have one. Dogs and elephants are the only animals that can naturally understand pointing.,Surprised
174,They are? I guess both are really smart dogs can also see color so thats something.,Curious to dive deeper
174," Interesting. Always thought they were color blind. Google also prefers dogs to cats, so much that it is in their code of conduct.",Surprised
174," And that's why I love Google, that and also the fact that Google has saved my life many times lol",Curious to dive deeper
174,I feel bad for stray dogs sometimes. Istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for them if you recycle plastic bottles.,Sad
174,I guess those vending machines make a lot of doggies happy and also they help keep the streets clean. Its a win win situation I guess,Curious to dive deeper
174,yeah I think you're right. Another good cause is doggy blood drives. However not sure how the dogs feel about that since they can't consent. Haha.,Surprised
174," There are 12 different types of bloods in dogs, how interesting is that",Curious to dive deeper
174,Interesting! What kind of dogs do you like?,Curious to dive deeper
174," I like small dogs, big dogs are high maintenance and scare others, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
174," Yeah I love a little dog, especially one in a little sweater or a shirt! I've even seen one in a polo shirt. The polo shirt was actually invented for tennis, not polo!",Happy
174," Really always thought it was a polo things, shirts are part of our culture and I guess polo shirts are a classic now",Curious to dive deeper
174," Yeah, they were invented for tennis player Rene ""the crocodile"" Lacoste. Another shirt I like is the Hawaiian shirt. Have yet to see one on a dog. That's the official business attire in Hawaii.",Curious to dive deeper
174," Oh so Lacoste was the inventor, thats really interesting, did you hear about Bill Mays funeral?",Curious to dive deeper
174," No, I haven't hear about it.",Curious to dive deeper
174,Apparently the pallbearers wore Blue shirts in his funeral and also khaki pants.,Curious to dive deeper
174," That is kind of cool. Speaking of cool, do you think Ugg boots are cool? They were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after getting out of the water.",Curious to dive deeper
174,I do wear them specially in the winter or when it rains I like to wear sport shoes better but boots can be comfy.,Curious to dive deeper
174," Yeah, I like them too. I have cozy sweater looking ones for the house. It's getting hot where I am already but we were blessed with another cool day. I'm going to go enjoy the evening, have a good one!",Happy
175," Hello there, are you a dog or a cat person?",Curious to dive deeper
175,I would have to say I am a cat person,Neutral
175," I think I am a dog person, but I don't mind cats.  Did you know dogs have 12 different blood types?",Curious to dive deeper
175,That is cool.  I heard they also have doggie blood drives too.,Neutral
175,Yeah that is super cool!  Did you also know that dogs are not color blind like most people think?,Curious to dive deeper
175," Yeah, I heard that they can see colors, not as well as we do but still in color",Neutral
175," They also, along with elephants, are the only two animals the seem to understand pointing by instincts. ",Curious to dive deeper
175,They are definitely mart animals.  That might by Google prefers them to cats.,Neutral
175," That is so weird, and I guess they came out and declared they were a dog company. ",Curious to dive deeper
175," Yeah.  I dont know why, but that is how they identify.",Neutral
175," Did you know that in Istanbul, they have a vending machine for stray dogs?",Curious to dive deeper
175,Yes!  It is such a cool concepts.  Recycle bottles for  dog food.  How neat!,Happy
175," Yeah I think that is really cool, and I know other countries around the world have big stray dog problems. ",Curious to dive deeper
175,I think even one place in Russia dogs are trained on using the subway.,Curious to dive deeper
175,That is incredible.  Did you know the dog was the first species to be domesticated?,Curious to dive deeper
175," Wow, I didn't know that.  I would have thought it was cats.",Neutral
175,Yeah I thought the same thing!,Curious to dive deeper
175,I wonder why dogs seem to chew on shoes so much.,Curious to dive deeper
175," Same here, I know I have had plenty of shoes torn up in my lifetime by dogs!",Curious to dive deeper
175,Did you know boots are a type of footwear and not a specific shoe?,Curious to dive deeper
175," No, I didn't know that.  It was nice talking to you today, I hope you have a day!",Curious to dive deeper
176,Hello! Do you own any dogs?,Surprised
176,I do!  I have one and have had one all my life since I was a kid.,Happy
176,Oh nice! Me too! Google even prefers dogs to cats lol.,Curious to dive deeper
176,Nice!  Some dogs in Moscow have learned to use the subway!,Happy
176," Well those dogs are definitely smarter than me lol. Dogs aren't color blind either, just don't see the same thing we see!",Happy
176,I wonder why they always have said they are? lol  I always find it amusing how a dog drinks with the underside of their tongue.,Happy
176,That is so cool. Dogs are so smart for sure! Dogs and elephants are the only animals that understand pointing.,Surprised
176,Cool!  Russia has a tomb of the unknown dog as a memorial for canine research subjects.  Kind of sad.,Happy
176,It really is. I just love dogs haha. Did you know in Hawaii the office attire of choice is the aloha shirt? Talk about comfy!,Happy
176,Nice!  Sign me up!  lol  At Billy Mays funeral the pallbearers wore blue shorts and khaki pants.  Kind of casual and different.,Happy
176,RIP Billy Mays! I like how polo shirts were originally invited for tennis players.,Surprised
176,I didn't know that!  I know the tshirt was invented in 1904 and was marketed to bachelors who couldn't sew or replace buttons.,Happy
176,That would be the market I would have been in back then haha. I wish I would have invented the Ugg boots back then too haha.,Happy
176," Yes!  When we're they created?""  I think they have been around since the 1800's?",Curious to dive deeper
176,They were actually invented by surfers to keep their feet warm on the beach after surfing!,Surprised
176,Nice.  I'm thinking of a different boot then.  lol  The late musician Prince was a fantastic bowler and wore knee high furry boots while doing it.,Happy
176,That would have been a sight to see! The first person ever to be photographed was actually getting his boots cleaned.,Surprised
176," I think I've read about that before and have seen the picture.  I think it was in Paris, France.",Happy
176," It was, and took place in 1838.",Surprised
176,You should google it.  It's pretty neat.  They are really tiny and didn't know they were in the picture.,Happy
176,Will do! Have a good one!,Surprised
177,Hi do you like to wear shirts?  I do!  I wear them every day.,Happy
177,I do.  I would be comfortable in Hawaii where the aloha shirt is official business attire.,Neutral
177,Wouldn't that be awesome to go to work like that!  At Billy Mays funeral the pallbearers all wore blue shirts and khaki pants.,Happy
177," Yeah, the ""shirt"" covers such a broad variety of garments that cover the upper body.  A shirt can also be worn as a necktie.",Neutral
177,True.  I've used them over my head to keep the sun off me. lol,Happy
177,Is it proper to wear shirts and boots that match?,Neutral
177,I would guess so? lol  Do you own a pair of Ugg boots?,Happy
177,I use to back when I was stationed in California and took up surfing.  They were actually invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after getting out of the ocean.,Neutral
177,Nice.  I was going to ask if you lived by the ocean. I've never had any even though I live by Lake Michigan.  The Nokia company originally started making rubber boots in the 1800's and they still make them to this day.,Happy
177,I use to live near Lake Michigan.  I have been to both oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. I don't know if my Ugg boots would go well with my Hawaiian shirt.  What do you think?,Happy
177," That's awesome you've been able to see all those places.  The way I see it if you have the chance to where you can wear both at the same time, then go for it.  Life is about have fun right? lol",Happy
177,I suppose.  Talking about having fun.  Did you know that farmers use to put custom boots on their turkeys.  That's just weird! lol,Surprised
177,lol That's funny.  I wonder if they did it so they wouldn't get clawed?  My friend had chickens growing up and they had a rooster that was super mean and would go out of it's way to try to claw you.,Happy
177,Need to see if that rooster could take out a dog!  Some roosters have pretty long spikes on their feet.,Curious to dive deeper
177," Oh yeah.  That sucker was mean let me tell you.  I think I would have a rabid dog chase me, which by the way dogs are not color blind!",Happy
177," We could call the bout a "" Cock-a-Poodle-Do"".  That was bad! lol.  I know dogs aren't color blind but they don't see as many colors as humans do.",Happy
177,LOL That's funny!  Google prefers dogs over cats!  The wrote in their code of conduct that they are a dog company.  It's been fun chatting with you!,Happy
177," Yeah, google is weird that way.  I am a cat person.  Nice talking with you.  Have a nice day!",Neutral
177,Dogs and elephants are the only animals that instinctively understand pointing.  You have a nice day too!  Thanks for the chat!,Happy
177,I read that somewhere once.  lol,Surprised
177,Cool!  Have a good day!,Happy
178," Hello, did you know the dodo bird is actual a sub-family of the pigeon.",Surprised
178," I didn't know that- of course I believe the bird is extinct, isn't it?  This year we recently had a bunch of hummingbirds..that was a first for me and so exciting. SO TINY..",Surprised
178,I also find it interesting that some birds can fly from alaska to north america without sleeping when they migrate.,Curious to dive deeper
178,Birds are very interesting because of a lot of facts.  I think it helps with their flight that their bones are hollow so not weighed down.,Neutral
178," Yes, they are interesting. I did not know that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I find that very interersting.",Curious to dive deeper
178,I have watched them pull some to make them nearby.  The way they flit about is so beautiful to watch.  It is almost elegant like a dance. ..performing art!,Happy
178," Yes, did you know that Jackie Chan manages a k-pop band. I did not know that but i think it's cool.",Curious to dive deeper
178," It seems that so many you wouldn't think to have other interests do.  Jackie in music, Bruce Lee in dancing.  A championship even!",Surprised
178,It seems to be in a kpop band you have to be tough because they go through bootcamps before being signed.,Surprised
178,Boot camps for bands.. Guess it takes a lot of stamina for the dancing and singing.  Kind of the same I would assume for figure skating.  Can you imagine the work to land a triple axel?,Curious to dive deeper
178,That is true. It looks hard. Did you know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. They are cute.,Curious to dive deeper
178," Music is a wonderful thing, so much to come out of it.  Symbiotic relationship with dance and music. Tupac was able to do both- never would have thought ballet for him though.",Surprised
178," Yes, that definitely does not fit his image. I was surprised that ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week. That is a lot.",Curious to dive deeper
178," The tip starts to break down and doesn't hold form.  Same with skates, have to keep them sharp or can't get the edge for spins and jumps. Would have to assume that Nagasu goes through a lot of skates for this reason.",Curious to dive deeper
178,I like that she wanted to do the triple axel so bad that she dreamed she could . That shows heart for wanting to do something.,Curious to dive deeper
178," Especially when she had been passed over for the previous Olympics.  Rippon omitted his quad jump at the start, not as much heart I guess.",Neutral
178,And she is part of the record books for being the first U.S. lady to land triple axel in olympic competition.,Curious to dive deeper
178,She had her wish of making America proud.  Guess the same can't be said for the Russians because of the prior doping scandal.,Disgusted
178," Yes, the doping scandal can be hard to come back from. It is amazing the amount of doping in sports today.",Curious to dive deeper
178," You would think that rather than compromising, like the Olympic committee did, they would just start to ban them.  Isn't teaching them anything to allow certain numbers to still participate and medal.",Disgusted
178,That's true. Did you know Michael Jackson had a patent on his leaning dance move.,Neutral
178,I didn't know that there was a device involved in it.  Wonder with his death if the patent transferred to someone?,Surprised
178,Maybe it got passed down to his children.,Surprised
178,He certainly was talented.  Wonder if he did his own choreography?,Curious to dive deeper
178,I think he did. He worked too hard and I think that is what caused his death. He had his whole family to take care of really.,Surprised
178,So much control.  At least after he left Jackson 5 he had some freedom unlike the kids in K pop. Agencies controlling everything. Yikes!,Surprised
178,That is true and to think K-pop had it's first group of women in the 60's is surprising. I thought k-pop was pretty new.,Surprised
178," I was vaguely familiar with H.O.T. , Korean version of Backstreet Boys. Social networking and YouTube have launched a lot of the Korean Wave.",Neutral
178,Yes and they have the loudest and most loyal fans.,Surprised
178,I wonder if because they are now going global with this music if you will start to see fusion music.  Would mix well with Latin beats.,Happy
178,I like that when North korea sank a south korean warship they blasted the k-pop song hit your heart on loud speakers.,Neutral
178," I wonder if that song was by their own K pop girl band, moranbong,  or if they selected it from someone else?",Curious to dive deeper
178,Moranbong  band was  the most popular music group in the country. They must have a lot of fans.,Surprised
178,It is generally classified that way..K Pop.  Seems to have a more narrow sense of description and influence than back when they were around though.,Neutral
178,And they say with social media and tv  shows  k-pop are gaining a widespread global audience.,Surprised
178," To think that   different styles and genres of music can influence modern culture to such an extent as to become an ""idol"" like culture is mind boggling.",Surprised
178," Yes, and I did not realize that when they are in bootcamp they are charged for everything. So when they make it famous they have to pay it all back.",Surprised
178," Just like any other job, pay for the training.  Unfortunately in this instance the control extends beyond all the way to love lives, behavior and diets.  Not for me thank you.",Disgusted
178,It is like they control every part of their lives. That would  be very hard especially if they are young.,Surprised
178," Maybe they will evolve, like the birds.  Sprout wings that give them flight.  Would think they would be more like an Ostrich or penguin in comparison..flightless.",Sad
178,I think so .,Neutral
179,Do you like to dance?,Curious to dive deeper
179,I do sometimes even though I am terrible haha. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
179,I'm terrible also. Hilarious!,Curious to dive deeper
179," We should have taken lessons from Bruce Lee when we had the chance, or were alive way back then lol.",Curious to dive deeper
179," Yeah, I heard he was a great dancer. Apparently Tupac was pretty good too. ",Curious to dive deeper
179,Yea he portrayed the mouse king in a production of the nutcracker in high school for ballet!,Curious to dive deeper
179," Hilarious, I know he used to be a backup dancer for Digital Underground. ",Curious to dive deeper
179," Oh really? What an awesome fact! I know that when I was a baby, I would spontaneously dance (that's what my parents said). It's crazy how natural dancing is!",Curious to dive deeper
179,Hilarious. I didn't know that babies did that.,Happy
179,I wonder if they do it more listening to K-Pop? That's the Korean music craze going on now!,Curious to dive deeper
179," Yeah, that is pretty funny. I'm not sure, MJ had a patent on dance moves though. ",Curious to dive deeper
179,I remember seeing a video on that. It allowed him to achieve an extreme lean on his dance moves?,Curious to dive deeper
179," yeah, that is pretty cool. What do you think about birds? ",Curious to dive deeper
179,I think birds are crazy lol. It's cool their entire skeleton weights less than their feathers!,Curious to dive deeper
179," yeah, that is pretty cool isn't it. What about hummingbirds, do you know anything about them? ",Curious to dive deeper
179," I know they steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. When I get a spider web on me, I freak out lol.",Curious to dive deeper
179,That is pretty scary. I wonder what noises birds in australia make?,Curious to dive deeper
179," I think they've learned to make sounds like cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws. That would be weird to hear huh?",Curious to dive deeper
179," Yeah, that is pretty weird isn't it? I wonder if it is true. Well, nice chatting with you. ",Curious to dive deeper
179,I will have to check that out. Nice chatting with you as well!,Curious to dive deeper
179,Take it easy.,Curious to dive deeper
180,Do you know why baseball manager wear the uniforms like the players do?,Curious to dive deeper
180,I do!  They wear it because they are technically able to play for their tams if the need arises!  Baseball is a pretty popular sport in Japan.,Curious to dive deeper
180,Yeah i hear they think it should be their pastime. I wonder if a manager has ever jumped into a game.,Curious to dive deeper
180,They can if need be.  There are some major baseballs fans out there!,Curious to dive deeper
180,Yeah unfortunately I do not have the patience for it. Kickball is called soccer baseball in Canada.,Curious to dive deeper
180,That's a funny term in my opinion!  There was one person who found 3 million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic.  He  hit a gold mine!,Curious to dive deeper
180," Right, why can't stuff like that happen to me, lol. Up until 2005 a married couple was responsible for scheduling all 2430 major league games. ",Curious to dive deeper
180,Dang that sounds like a busy life scheduling all that!  One thing I like from baseball is they get to wear hats.  Do you like hats?,Curious to dive deeper
180," Love hats, all kinds my friend. How about you? ",Curious to dive deeper
180," Yep I do also!  Fun little fact about in the Old West, the Cowboy hat was not the most popular.  The Bowler hat was, whichever that looks like!",Curious to dive deeper
180," Yeah police wear distinct hats usually peaked caps or brimmed hats, like the mounties. ",Curious to dive deeper
180,Yep their hats are noticeable!  Another fun fact I learned is a chefs funny hat they wear are called Toque!,Curious to dive deeper
180,Yeah that is a fun fact i did not know that. Some hats were worn for ceremonial purposes such as the mortarboard.,Curious to dive deeper
180,Ahh yes!  All this knowledge of hats!  Lol!  British politicians were mandated to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the house of commons until 1998!,Curious to dive deeper
180,Wow that good information. Do you know where tipping your hat originated from?,Curious to dive deeper
180,Yep it just so happens to come from knights raising their face visors to show friendliness!,Curious to dive deeper
180,I think that's really cool! In 1908 a law was passed limiting the length of the hatpins out of fear that suffragettes would use them as weapons.,Curious to dive deeper
180,Wow sounded dangerous!  Did you know Dunce caps were worn to encourage foolish behavior?,Curious to dive deeper
180,Well that's must be were the term originated. You know panda researcher wear panda suits to work.,Curious to dive deeper
180," I did not know that, but sounds fun!  Any who, was nice chatting with ya!",Curious to dive deeper
180,You also have a great day!! In parting I tip my hat to you my friend.,Curious to dive deeper
181,Hello,Neutral
181," Hello, how are you? Do you like baseball?",Neutral
181,I enjoy it. It is such a fun fast paced game to watch. Do you like it?,Curious to dive deeper
181,I do enjoy baseball. There is nothing like going to a ball game. Did you know that the managers wear uniforms because they can technically can play if there is a need for it?,Curious to dive deeper
181,Really? I wouldn't have guessed that looking at most of the managers. They don't seem quite as in shape as most of the players on the team.,Neutral
181," Haha, I agree. It must be incase of injury or something. It's a strange rule. Did you hear the story about the man who found a bunch of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic? They were worth 3 million dollars!",Surprised
181,Oh man can you imagine going through stuff and all of sudden you come across a haul like that?! I would probably have a heart attack right then and there.,Neutral
181," I couldn't even imagine, I would be so shocked. In japan baseball is very popular, and they are surprised to hear it;s status as america's national pastime?",Curious to dive deeper
181,I wonder why they were surprised. Baseball has always been such a popular game here in the states. Maybe because we are so synonomous with football?,Curious to dive deeper
181,What is your favorite team?,Neutral
181,I guess if I had to pick I would go with the twins. They are a pretty decent team. I wonder if there was any twins cards in that guys 3 million dollar find.,Neutral
181," Maybe, that must of been so cool to find them.",Neutral
181,I would be so excited to find something like that just sitting in my family's attic. Since they were from the 40's there had to be some amazing cards in there.,Happy
181,Do you collect anything? I like to collect hats.,Curious to dive deeper
181,Not really unless kids costumes count. I always thought hats were super neat. They have such a long and rich history.,Curious to dive deeper
181," Yes they do, tipping your hat origin is from when a knight raises their visors.",Curious to dive deeper
181,That is a neat fact! I love that people always associate the cowboy hat with the old west but really it was the bowler that was the favorite of the time.,Happy
181,That is true. The party hat originates from dunce caps... they were worn at parties to encourage a more foolish behavior!,Curious to dive deeper
181,That is funny. I always thought of them as a punishment hat. Well it has been nice chatting with you have a good evening.,Curious to dive deeper
181,You as well. Take care.,Neutral
181,Bye,Neutral
182," Hi, how are you doing today?",Neutral
182,Good. Do you watch baseball? Back in August the nationals traded Daniel Murphy and Matt Adams before a game,Curious to dive deeper
182,Sometimes I follow baseball. Usually around playoffs. Did the Nationals make a mistake?,Neutral
182," I don't think so, they weren't doing too good in the standings plus they're stadium was half empty",Neutral
182," I guess it was time to make a change, maybe rebuild.",Neutral
182," Yea they weren't doing too good, they were in third place in their division behind the Phillies",Neutral
182," I think it's tough to the lineup just right. Too many variables, and the team needs to gel as well.",Neutral
182," Yea and the fans weren't too happy with trading Daniel Murphy, guess he was a fan favorite",Neutral
182,Did he sell enough tickets though? Probably most fans would want a winning team.,Neutral
182," Probably, they can always let their baseball manager play as they are technically allowed to play",Neutral
182," That's a funny rule, isn't it. It must be a holdover from early days when a player also served as manager.",Neutral
182," Yea, I remember back in the 1970s when Pete Rose was a manager he would sometimes play in the games too",Neutral
182,Pete really was a competitive guy. He also bet against his team sometimes though.,Neutral
182,Yea that's not good. I have old Pete Rose baseball cards but they're not worth 3 million like the cards a man found in his grandfather's attic,Neutral
182," That guy must not have been able to believe his luck. I wonder what he did with the cards. I would have sold half and kept half. Money now, plus a long-term investment.",Neutral
182,I'd take a trip to Japan where baseball is also very popular,Neutral
182," The baseball there is just not as good as in the US. Still, it's a difference experience at the stadium. It's an interesting lesson in cultural difference.",Neutral
182," I'd like to visit England too, it's funny how until 1998 their politicians had to wear a top hat in the house of commons",Neutral
182,I guess rules get held over for the sake of tradition. The old guard wants politicians in top hats and managers in player uniforms.,Neutral
182,And Johnny Depp wears his Jack Sparrow costume to make visits to hospitals,Neutral
182,He really does his best for the kids. I like that he's willing to make some kid's day better.,Neutral
182," He is a good person. Well I got to go, nice talking with you",Neutral
183,do you like baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
183,Yes I do. Do you know why the managers wear uniforms?,Curious to dive deeper
183,Yes because they can play of the team needs them to,Curious to dive deeper
183,Yeah. Do you know what kickball is called in Canada?,Curious to dive deeper
183,Yes it is called soccer-baseball,Curious to dive deeper
183,Yeah I guess it makes sense because it has elements from both games,Curious to dive deeper
183,Yeah true. Do you know who used to do the MLB schedule for 24 years?,Curious to dive deeper
183,Yes it was a couple who scheduled all games each year,Curious to dive deeper
183,That is impressive. Do you wear hats at all?,Curious to dive deeper
183,sometimes. In the UK they hat to wear top hats to make a point in the House of COmmons,Curious to dive deeper
183,Cool. DO you know which was the most popular hat in the old west?,Curious to dive deeper
183,contrary to common belief it was not the cowboy hat but the bowler hat,Curious to dive deeper
183,I know right? Do you know where the tipping of the hat originated from,Curious to dive deeper
183,Yes that was from back then when the knights lifted their visors to show friendliness,Curious to dive deeper
183,Yeah. DO you know the origins of the conical party hat?,Curious to dive deeper
183,Yes that was from the dunce hat that encouraged foolish behavior,Curious to dive deeper
183,Haha crazy. DO you know that panda researchers wear panda costumes?,Curious to dive deeper
183,Yes so pandas do not feel threatened I think. Did you know Sean Bean is scared of flying?,Curious to dive deeper
183,Yeah so much that he once hiked in a full costume to the filming site,Curious to dive deeper
183,WOw dedication and fear. Johnny Depp visits kids in hospitals wearing the Jack Sparrow costume,Curious to dive deeper
183,That must be so uplifting for the kids,Curious to dive deeper
184," Hello, how do you do?",Neutral
184," hello, I'm alright!  Have you seen the new Christopher Robin movie?  I heard it was really for the whole family.  I remember seeing the trailer where Pooh goes, ""They say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day!"" I thought that line was funny.",Curious to dive deeper
184," I thought it was a clever adaptation of a classic that help the now older audience reconnect and relate in order to reconnect to their youth, perhaps having imaginary pals of their own",Neutral
184," Hmm.. sometimes I think all my pals are imaginary.  Sadly, I'm told the REAL Christopher Robin (who the books were based on) hated them and never took any money from them.  I find that sad, since his father wrote the books for him..",Sad
184,That is a shame. I wonder why the real chris hated them. Perhaps he wanted a father to be there for him rather than children books,Curious to dive deeper
184," I think maybe he felt embarrassed because the books were based so heavily on his life.  Did you know he died on Easter in 1996?  That was one year after I graduated from high school.  Man, I feel old!  LOL",Sad
184,Well I hope he at least found some solace in that it inspired and that it is a indispensable part of many children worldwide,Sad
184," Yeah, hopefully.  Anyway, like I said, I haven't seen it, I think I'll check and see if my library has it though.  I would get it from Netflix, but I don't have a subscription at the moment.  Are you on Netflix?  It's pretty awesome! They've got like 137 million subscribers worldwide.",Curious to dive deeper
184," While I understand their business model and why people use it, I never got it. It is impressive nonetheless that they account for 33% of all bandwith in north america during peak hours",Neutral
184," Yeah, I've heard they're especially busy in the late hours.  Get this, they have an hour long movie that's nothing but a roaring fireplace!  I think people play it a lot during the holidays or winter months to give their living rooms (or whatever) a decorative look.",Curious to dive deeper
184,I think that that is surprisingly practical for the ambiance. I bet blockbuster's ghost regrets not buying netflix,Neutral
184," Ha, yeah!  I'm told they laughed the Netflix people out of the office when they made an offer to them.  They regret that decision for sure!  ",Happy
184,I mean if I could pay 50million today for 2 billion in a few years wow what an investment,Neutral
184," Get this, Netflix has people on it's staff who's job is to watch the shows and tag the content (guessing with genre tags and stuff.)  Get PAID to watch Netflix?  Where do I sign up for that?  LOL",Happy
184,That does sound nice. I wonder if they will start outsourcing to us turkers?,Neutral
184," Ha, we could only hope!  Course, if I had Netflix it wouldn't be just for the movies and tv shows, I think I'd try some of their original programming as well.  For instance, I heard the show ""Stranger Things"" was really good. Have you seen that one?  ",Curious to dive deeper
184," I have not, but I have heard good things about their original content lately.",Neutral
184," Course, there's so many subscription services it's getting ridiculous.  Hulu, Amazon, Netflix, heck even Disney is coming out (or has it already?) with one for all their movies and properties.  ",Surprised
184,Well I mean they have to at least match up to their competitors so it is understandable. All that is left for consumers is to see who provides the best service,Neutral
184," Yeah, but it must suck if several of them offer exclusively shows/movies that you REALLY to see.  When it was all just Netflix, you pretty much could get whatever you wanted... Did you know Disney makes $1,110 per SECOND?  Wow... that blows my mind.",Sad
184," That is amazing. Disney sure has come a long way and while you don't really think of disney as a media company and more of a amusement park and animation studio, it is the largest media conglomerate in terms of revenue",Surprised
184," I think it's crazy when you think about just how much STUFF they own now.  I mean, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, the theme parks.  It's like they're trying to completely take over the world!  (laughs nervously)",Fearful
184," I agree it is the time of big corporations. I wonder if the tv show where the earth is ruled by corporations instead of countries will come to pass? In any case, thank you for the wonderful chat.",Happy
185,hi friend,Happy
185,Hello! Hope you're having a good day.,Happy
185,thank you friend do you like this topic,Happy

185,yes i know this books is so great,Happy
185,I agree! And I loved how the Christopher Robin movie brought the characters to live through a mix of live action and computer animation.,Happy
185,yes in this book is so interesting character also and nice book,Happy
185,Do you have a favorite Winnie-the-Pooh character?,Curious to dive deeper

185,yes l like you answer,Happy
185," Thank you! Hey, did you know the Christopher Robin movie was made by The Walt Disney Company?",Curious to dive deeper
185,OK you most favorite for other anyone books,Happy
185," Sure! I know Disney publishes a lot of books every year, too. It's a huge corporation.",Surprised
185,i like some Disney books,Happy
185,What are some of your favorites?,Curious to dive deeper
185,iam always  like  action story is my favorite,Happy
185," I enjoy action stories, too. Do you like action movies as well? I've seen some great ones on Netflix.",Curious to dive deeper
185,yes i watch for more than action movies for Netflix,Happy
185,I really love Netflix's streaming service. It's so convenient! What's the last movie you watched on Netflix?,Curious to dive deeper
185,yes you are really correct friend Netflix is good for always,Happy
185," Absolutely. Hey, friend, I've got to run, but it was great talking to you!",Neutral
185,thank you friend i really happy for talking for you,Happy

186,Do you enjoy movies?,Neutral
186," Yes, I do.  Do you?",Neutral
186,Do you usually watch them on netflix or at the theater?,Neutral
186," I used to watch movies at the theater a lot, but nowadays it's usually on Netflix.",Neutral
186,What you watched any walt disney films of late?,Neutral
186,I recently watched Christopher Robin with Ewan McGregor.  Have you seen it?,Curious to dive deeper
186,I heard about it. Christopher Robin is the adult version of winnie the pooh right?,Neutral
186," Yeah, that's the one.  Ewan McGregor is Christopher Robin as an adult.  But he ends up going back to the land that Winnie the Pooh and Tiger and all of them live in.",Curious to dive deeper
186," I think it's plot sounds wonderful for not only children, but also adults to reconnect with their childhoods in a similar manner",Neutral
186," Yeah.  It was pretty nostalgic for me since I used to love Winnie the Pooh as a kid.  It was fun.  I recommend it, if you're interested.",Happy
186,Sweet. It is too bad the real christopher robin disliked winnie the pooh,Neutral
186,Is that true?  I hadn't heard about that.,Surprised
186,Ya I guess he felt it was too close to his real life and perhaps he would rather have a father than a child's story,Neutral
186," Wow!  That's really interesting!  I can understand that.  Unfortunately, the movie didn't really address any of that.  That would have been cool to know as just a side bit of info while watching.",Surprised
186," Well regardless of how the real Christoper felt, it is hard to deny the place of winnie the pooh in the hearts of millions of children and adults today",Neutral
186,True.  Disney really hit it big getting to make that movie.,Neutral
186,Well disney has always done a good job in making great movies that are appealing to both children and adults,Neutral
186,Yeah for sure.  Mickey and Minerva Mouse have sure laid the groundwork for many decades of great entertainment!,Curious to dive deeper
186,True. I mean there is even a whole subculture dedicated to finding the hidden mickey mouse references in all things disney,Neutral
186,Do you think there actually is Mickey in every disney film?  Do you think that applies to Pixar too?,Curious to dive deeper
186," Yes I do. People love their easter eggs. In any case, thanks for taking the time to chat.",Neutral
187," Hi. how are you, this morning?",Happy
187," I'm doing well, how are you? Do you have kids, if so do you watch Cupcake and Dino? ",Curious to dive deeper
187," Doing good, thanks.  No kids here, but what is Cupcake and Dino?",Curious to dive deeper
187," Apparently it is a kids show, but I've never seen it. Maybe it is a movie. ",Curious to dive deeper
187,Have you seen the Christopher Robin film?  I was wondering how it was.,Curious to dive deeper
187," No, I didn't. It sounds like it could have been good Ewan McGregor is a pretty good actor. ",Curious to dive deeper
187," Yes, he is.  I didn't go see it, because I thought people would look at me strange seeing a ""kids"" movie.  But I always liked Winnie the Pooh, as a child.",Happy
187,It was a good show. Did you know Christopher Robin was a real boy?,Curious to dive deeper
187," I heard that he was the author's son in real life.  That's so cool, talk about having a book written about you.",Happy
187,I don't know if I could handle that to be honest.,Curious to dive deeper
187," Me either. Lol The New York public library is the home of the real Winnie the pooh toy teddy bear.  I saw it once on a school trip, it looked old and raggedy.",Happy
187,I didn't know that. So they still have it?,Surprised
187," Yes, they do. It's hard to believe that toy bear hasn't fallen apart, yet. It's like WW I era, that's old. ",Surprised
187,That's pretty cool. I wonder if they offer the movie on Netflix?,Curious to dive deeper
187," They probably do, I'm going to look for it and watch it, if they do.",Happy
187,Apparently netflix and youtube make up half of peak internet traffic in north america.,Curious to dive deeper
187,That I can totally see.  And the other half is on Facebook.. lol,Surprised
187," I believe it, although you have to wonder how much of that is actually instagram? ",Curious to dive deeper
187,How true.  I heard that Blockbuster had several chances to buy Netflix and didn't.  Big mistake on their part.,Surprised
187," I believe it, although you don't know if they would have ran it as successfully. ",Curious to dive deeper
187," That's true.  Well, it's been nice talking with you, I'll see you around.",Happy
188," Hi there, do you enjoy poetry?",Curious to dive deeper
188,No I really don't.I don't understand it and find it boring.,Neutral
188," Oh I see. Some of them can be cool though, like that poem that when read normally is depressing and vice versa",Curious to dive deeper
188," there is a 274 line poem called the chaos, i am assuming becaus it has irregularly pronounced words",Neutral
188," I would assume so too. THe Javanese alphabet too, if recited in order it forms a poem",Curious to dive deeper
188,the vikings were warrior poets. lol what the heck? did they just shout poetry at the enemy ?,Happy
188,Hahaha maybe that is how they fought. Allan Poe received only $9 for his poem The Raven. Not is is priceless,Curious to dive deeper
188,isn't that always the way? things don't become priceless until the person is dead. baltimore must be the place for poetry! first edgar allen poe and also tupac,Neutral
188," Yeah it seems that way. On another topic, do you like dogs?",Curious to dive deeper
188,Lol these really arent my favorite subjects. I am not a dog fan.,Neutral
188," Oh I see. But just for curiosity, they have 12 blood types, way more than we do",Curious to dive deeper
188,they can also reason better than chimps,Neutral
188," Seem lie it since they understand pointing, same as elephants",Curious to dive deeper
188,they enjoy solving a problem,Neutral
188,Yeah that too. Even Google has declared itself as a dog company,Curious to dive deeper
188,im guessing with that they allow employees to bring dogs to work? I can't ever figure out what makes them a dog compnay,Surprised
188,Well maybe and they have it in their code of conduct that they are a dog company,Curious to dive deeper
188,russia must really be into dogs they have a tomb of the unknown dog AND some of their dogs have learned to use the subway,Surprised
188,Wow that is impressive. For a long time I thought that dogs were colorblind but apprently they just do not see as many colors as we do,Curious to dive deeper
188,and they can learn over 1000 words. I guess thats why they make them service dogs,Surprised
188," Yeah, it makes sense. Nice chat",Curious to dive deeper
189,Which city is home to Netflix?,Curious to dive deeper
189,I've heard it's from Los Gatos in California. Do you use Netflix?,Curious to dive deeper
189,Yes.    I heard they have a lot of users worldwide.    Do you know how many?,Curious to dive deeper
189," I don't, but I use it to watch a few shows. What kind of stuff do you watch on it?",Curious to dive deeper
189,I love the movie Apollo 13 on netflix.    Can you believe that film inspired the whole service!,Surprised
189,No kidding? I had no idea! It's amazing what good cinematography can inspire in others.,Surprised
189," Nothing to do with the film, but founder Reed Hastings forgot to return a VHS tape and got $40 in late fees and wanted to do something about it!",Surprised
189," Hah, I guess cinematography isn't everything. I think we all know how he must have felt getting a late fee. If only everyone were as determined to do something about frustrations!",Surprised
189,True.    I do like cinematography though.     It is amazing what can come from a lens and light.,Surprised
189," Cinematography is so fascinating. It's like an intersection of physics and visual art, because of all the dependence on understanding how light and lenses work.",Curious to dive deeper
189," True, but it is also about technology - how the sensor produces an electrical charge for each pixel.",Happy
189,I can't pretend to understand all the technology behind it. It's like magic in a way.,Neutral
189," OK.    I guess ultimately it is about the people behind it, like James Wong Howe who won an Oscar.",Happy
189,Do you know what movie he won for?,Curious to dive deeper
189," I do not know, but he frequently used a crab dolly and deep-focus cinematography to create his style.",Happy
189,I wonder why some people have such a gift for cinematography. They seem to be able to picture things in their minds that make such a visual impact even though others wouldn't imagine it beforehand.,Curious to dive deeper
189," Very True.     Stanley Kubrick had a vision and took the camera from his cinematographer, but allowed him to keep the credit.",Surprised
189," I would be awfully annoyed if I were that cinematographer, haha. First I can't do my job, then I get credit for something I didn't even do!",Happy
189," I suppose, but the oscar and residuals from Spartacus probably help!",Surprised
189," That's true. I wouldn't mind getting paid for not having to do my job either, and as a cinematographer, he probably had a lot of appreciation for seeing Oscar-worthy work done in front of him by Kubrick.",Neutral
189,Perhaps the Internet Movie Database IMDb should create a new category for things like this!,Happy
189,That would be a great new addition. I use IMDB to look up moves and actors/actresses all the time.,Neutral
190," Have you seen Kevin Spacey in the ""Billionaire Boys Club"" movie?",Curious to dive deeper
190," I haven't seen it, actually. Is it any good?",Curious to dive deeper
190," I haven't. I heard that it's opening was a career low opening day total for Spacey, though. It's because of all the bad accusations against him, I think.",Curious to dive deeper
190," I saw him in the movie Baby Driver, but the accusations are definitely a deterrent for some people with how widespread #MeToo has become",Neutral
190," Yes, I actually haven't seen him in a movie since American Beauty. I watch movies on Netflix sometimes. Do you?",Curious to dive deeper
190," I have to be in the mood since I like to read and listen to a lot of books. I tend to create a watchlist on Netflix faster than I can watch things, but I like how convenient it is. I can't imagine having to rent movies from Blockbuster",Neutral
190,Netflix is really popular now. I hear it accounts for a third of all the bandwidth in North America during late night.,Surprised
190," I think the shows and movies help people unwind now, and there's no commercial breaks. Combined with YouTube, the two account for half the bandwidth in North America",Neutral
190,I hear Netflix actually spends more on postage than on bandwidth. The owner started the company after being annoyed by a late fee of his VHS movie rental.,Neutral
190," I would be annoyed about a rental fee that's higher than it costs for the VHS. It's still strange to think that people still use the rental service, but I guess internet connection isn't always the best in some places",Neutral
190,Yes I think maybe it's from parents getting stuff for their kids to watch while they can watch streaming Netflix at the same time.,Curious to dive deeper
190," Netflix is capable of streaming on more than one device at the same time depending on the subscription. Either way, it's still better than if Blockbuster had bought Netflix",Neutral
190," Of course. I think some wifi can't handle that, though. Yes, I heard they actually turned down buying Netflix. It was for much lower of a price than it's worth now, too!",Surprised
190,I think their value went up once they started creating their own content. It's part of the appeal now to keep users loyal,Neutral
190," Yes, Netflix creating their own content seems like it's part of a cinematography revolution or something!",Happy
190," Maybe if they team up with cinematographer Roger Deakins, his 14th nomination for the Oscars will be the one that finally wins. Losing 13 times would be hard",Curious to dive deeper
190," Yes, that would be hard. On the bright side, I bet not many cinematographers have been putting out such mention worthy work for so many years!",Curious to dive deeper
190," Not since James Wong Howe back in the 1940s. He was Chinese before finally becoming a citizen, but he used techniques such as low lighting and wide-angle lenses before it was popular",Neutral
190,Sounds like a very talented and revolutionary cinematographer. One of my favorites is Stanely Kubrick. He did Spartacus.,Happy
190," I've heard of him, though he didn't get the credit for his work. Sounds like a stand-up guy though",Neutral
190," Well I guess he's usually considered a producer, but he did a lot of the work on Spartacus. He is a cool guy...you should look up an interview of his.",Happy
191,Have you ever been on a blind date?,Curious to dive deeper
191,No but I heard blind dates can be quite successful and lead to marriage,Neutral
191,I did too and people rate them on a 1-5 scale. Do you think people care about their date's shoes?,Curious to dive deeper
191," I think women tend to care more about the shoes then men, men tend to only care more about function than style",Neutral
191,Did you know that professional ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week? I hope they're not too expensive!,Surprised
191,That's insane. I just learned they have Wizard of Oz inspired shoes that can guide you home when you click you heels,Neutral
191,That's pretty cool! I like that Steve Smith leaves his cleats every game to make people aware of the homeless without shoes.,Happy
191," Yea, that is very thoughtful. Did you know in the 9th century Persian Cavalry soldiers wore high-heeled shoes>",Curious to dive deeper
191,I can't imagine soldiers in high heels! Another thing I can't imagine because it's portrayed differently is that pilgrims wore tons of colorful clothes and black only for special occasions?,Surprised
191,I never knew that but there are still African tribes that wear old Victorian clothing so anythings possible,Neutral
191,Me either.  Did you know Apple had a clothing line 1986? I thought they only did technology...,Curious to dive deeper
191," Well there are some odd clothing compaines, Miguel Cabarello makes bulletproof clothings",Neutral
191,I wonder if that is extra heavy? I would love to visit the store in Alabama that sells clothes etc from unclaimed baggage at the airport. I bet there's some interesting things.,Neutral
191," Speaking of airport clothing, a man in China once wore 70 clothing items just to avoid bagging fees",Neutral
191," Well the fees are getting high on some airlines! I wonder how much it happens that a label says made somewhere, but is really made elsewhere like with Rip Curl?",Curious to dive deeper
191,Probably a lot. Did you know at Billy Mays funeral the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khakis?,Curious to dive deeper
191,I would love to see a gang in America layer shirts with popped collars like they did in China!,Neutral
191," Lol, sounds better than Mark Zuckerburgs plain shirts that cost $300-$400",Neutral
191,That's crazy! It would be nice to have business attire be an aloha shirt like in Hawaii. I would be much more comfortable.,Happy
191,Yea that sounds much more comfortable than a blue shirt and khakis,Neutral
191,I agree! Have a great night!,Neutral
192," Hello,  do you like shoes?",Curious to dive deeper
192," I do, only have a few pairs but I do like them, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
192," Yes,  I love shoes.  Did you know ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of shoes a week!",Curious to dive deeper
192," I didnt, the must spend a fortune in shoes, there are 17 wayts to tie shoes!!",Curious to dive deeper
192," wow,  I only know 3 lol ",Curious to dive deeper
192," I know the one lol, do you remember Bill Nye the science guy?",Curious to dive deeper
192,Yeah definitely!,Curious to dive deeper
192," Ok so apparently he holds a patent for ballet pointe shoes, seems like he is a fan of ballet or just a science guy that stumbled into a great invention",Curious to dive deeper
192," wow really.  that seems weird lol did you know putting dry tea bads in smelly shoes or gm bads will absorb the unpleasant odor. This actually works really well, we put it in our snowboard boots lol ",Curious to dive deeper
192," Yeah that sounds really weird, do you keep up with fashion? ",Curious to dive deeper
192,not really lol I just buy whatever looks good on me.,Curious to dive deeper
192," I see, well Tshirts were invented back in 1904,directed to bachelors actually",Surprised
192,Oh really that is interesting. The official business attire in hawaii is that aloha shirt.,Curious to dive deeper
192," That is interesting as well, do you know Mark Zuckerberg, he always wears grey shirts, they seem simple but they actually cost around 300-400 dollars each",Curious to dive deeper
192,lol no I didnt I havent noticed.,Curious to dive deeper
192," They seem like a regular $10 t-shirt but yeah they are worth a lot of money, ",Surprised
192," Thats interesting,  maybe he like a certain brand or whatever.  Did you know Polo shirts were invented for tennis players?",Curious to dive deeper
192," Really? by tennis players? the name doesnt serve them justice, Polo takes all the credit lol",Curious to dive deeper
192,lol so weird right,Curious to dive deeper
192," I know right, did you know a chinese man wore 70 items of clothing to avoid the bagging charge, that must have been funny to watch",Curious to dive deeper
192,Wow I wonder how much the baggage charge wouldve been lol that doesnt seem worth it.,Curious to dive deeper
192," Maybe he had no money left lol, sounds like a lot of trouble only to avoid paying a fee, there is bulletproof clothing called mogul",Curious to dive deeper
192,Its been good chatting.,Neutral
193,How are you today.,Curious to dive deeper
193,Well thank you. Do you have any hobbies?,Neutral
193,Funny you mention it i use to write a little poetry. how about you?,Curious to dive deeper
193," I used to do a little poetry in high school, learning about allusions, symbolism, and all the other poetry jargon. ",Neutral
193,Wow that's taking me back. Poetry dates back to prehistoric times.,Curious to dive deeper
193," Poetry was first written by the Greeks I believe. Perhaps earlier, but I don't think we have any other ancient written works dating prior",Neutral
193,The earliest western poetry was written in Sumerian.,Curious to dive deeper
193," Was it as complex then as today? Using rhyme, rhetoric, and other literary devices?",Neutral
193,One was called the Epic of Sundiata an example of griot court poetry. This was in Africa.,Curious to dive deeper
193," Writing poetry is definitely an art. For instance, there is poem that when read normally is depressing, yet backwards it is inspiring. Perhaps embodying the silver lining to a negative situation.",Surprised
193,Wow i would like to read that one. There is an alphabet that when recited in order forms a poem. I for get which one.,Curious to dive deeper
193," To this day poetry influenced our perceptions. For instance, all the hobbit's character names are derived from the poem dvergatal",Neutral
193,Now that i did not know. Do you like dogs?,Curious to dive deeper
193," Who doesn't? I think that humans can bond with most animals, even crocs, but the level of intimacy is different from that of dogs since dogs and humans have evolved side by side to be better attuned to one another",Neutral
193,I agree for instance did you know that dogs have 12 different blood types and they donate blood?,Curious to dive deeper
193,I did. I was surprised I never thought about animals donating bird before I learned that fact,Neutral
193,Apparently google prefers dogs to cats.,Curious to dive deeper
193,Then I wonder if employees can bring their dogs to work every day?,Curious to dive deeper
193,Apparently they've even written it into their code of conduct.,Curious to dive deeper
193,Well I guess Google simply acknowledges that dogs are man's best friend,Neutral
193,I always believed that dogs were color blind but that's not entirely true.,Curious to dive deeper
193,I think they can only see less colors like blue and yellow,Neutral
193,Yeah they can't see as many colors as we can. Nice chatting with you.,Curious to dive deeper
194," Hi, how are you?",Happy
194," Im great, do you know who Mariah Carey is?",Curious to dive deeper
194,I do. Do you like her music?,Curious to dive deeper
194," Yeah she has some decent songs, Glitter is one of my favorites and  Pet Semaraty is also good",Curious to dive deeper
194," Did you ever see her ""Cribs"" episode on MTV? She is super-extra!",Happy
194," No I didnt catch that episode, so do you like Pop music?",Curious to dive deeper
194,I do like pop music. Did you know Ariana Grande got hit by a puck twice in one game?,Happy
194," I didn't know that, that is odd lol, twice in a game? she must have a puck magnet in her forehead.",Curious to dive deeper
194," Yeah, it just was on twitter or Apple news this past weekend. There's a picture of her sitting on a zamboni too!",Happy
194," I guess there's a lot of controversy because of that, do you like snakes?",Curious to dive deeper
194,No. I hate snakes. I mean irrational hate! Do you?,Fearful
194," I have a healthy respect for them and would scream like a little girl if I ever saw one next to me lol, they are interesting animals though",Fearful
194," My 7 year old asked if he could get one and I tried to act cool, like I wasn't completely afraid of the notion! I was cool as a cucumber...",Fearful
194,And did you bought you r7 year old a snake lol?,Fearful
194,Nope! He got a cat. And I hate that thing. It's the worst cat ever. He just scratches and pees everywhere. JERK!,Angry
194," I agree im more of a dog person myself, maybe a snake was a better choice I would be afraid but I wouldnt worry about scratches and pee",Fearful
194,Yeah. She is going to a farm in the spring. That's not code. OUr friend has a farm and some barn cats so she will be relocated there.,Happy
194," I see, well interesting fact about snakes, sometimes they are born with two heads and both head end up fighting for food.",Curious to dive deeper
194,That's really weird. Bite the head to spite the stomach!,Surprised
194,Yeah and also 70% of the snakes lay eggs others give live birth another surprising fact.,Curious to dive deeper
194,Gross. Nice chatting with you!,Happy
195,Do you listen to Mariah Carey?,Curious to dive deeper
195," I do, I have been a fan of the All I want for Christmas is You.  ",Neutral
195,That was a good album. I'm not sure if she has released anything recently though.,Curious to dive deeper
195," I dont know either, she does have an incredible vocal range though.  No other singer really has matched her there.",Neutral
195,Do you think she will go on tour soon?,Curious to dive deeper
195," I'm not sure, but I know Glitter has gone to the top of the charts recently",Neutral
195,Is that her new album? I wonder if it is doing better than Linkin Parks Hybrid theory.,Curious to dive deeper
195," It is one of hers, but not better than Linkin Park's that was the best selling album of all time.",Neutral
195," Apparently, NWA's album was the first to reach platinum status without the support of airplay. ",Curious to dive deeper
195," That is pretty incredible, now musicians have it much easier as distribution of music is easier, you dont have to go to the store to buy things anymore.",Neutral
195," Yeah, with Youtube and things like that. Do you own any snakes? ",Curious to dive deeper
195," Nope.  Im like New Zeland, no snakes.  But I do have some friends who own them.",Curious to dive deeper
195," Interesting, I didn't know there were no snakes in new Zealand. ",Curious to dive deeper
195," Im now sure why, maybe all the other animals ate them or something.  Have you heard of those flying snakes that can launch themselves at their prey?  That would be totally creepy",Neutral
195," No, do they have wings? ",Curious to dive deeper
195," I dont know, all that I imagine is kind of like this cartoon character I saw once, Trogdor, That is what I think of.  ",Curious to dive deeper
195," Well, did you know there are legless lizards that aren't snakes? ",Curious to dive deeper
195,Really?  Thats kind of crazy.  I wonder if they have the paired organs like snakes do.,Neutral
195," I'm not sure, but at least they don't fly like some snakes!",Curious to dive deeper
195,If I ever ran into one of those flying snakes I dont know what I would do.  The fear of snakes is hard wired into both human and monkey brains.,Neutral
195," Yeah, they can be scary looking creatures, that is for sure. ",Curious to dive deeper
196,Hey there!  Are you a Beatles fan?,Curious to dive deeper
196," Good evening, why yes, I am.  Are you?",Happy
196,Who was your favorite Beatle?  Think I like Ringo just 'cause he's kinda goofy.,Curious to dive deeper
196,George Harrison was my favorite.,Happy
196,Cool.  Most people tend to say John or Paul.  Probably because they were the primary songwriters.  You have a favorite song?,Curious to dive deeper
196," She loves you, Yeah, yeah, yeah!  Only because we played it while I was in Junior High band and we thought we were cool!",Curious to dive deeper
196," One of the songs I like is ""Come Together."" Did you know it was actually written for Timothy Leary's 1969 California governor campaign?  ",Curious to dive deeper
196,I didn't know that.  Interesting.,Surprised
196," Another one I like is A Hard Days Night.  Think I relate to the line that goes ""And I've been working like a dog."" 1) Because I'm overworked and 2) because I'm a dog person. You like dogs?",Curious to dive deeper
196," Yes, I am a dog person.  Good segue, by the way.  I have 2.  Do you have any?",Curious to dive deeper
196," Don't have any but my kids keep bugging me for one.  They keep reminding me ""they're man's best friend!"" Thinking that will make me think it'll be easier to take care of.  What kind of dogs do you have?",Curious to dive deeper
196,I have a 12 year old yellow lab and a 10 year old yorkie/ poodle mix and they are the best and are truly man's best friend!,Happy
196,How good are they at taking directions?  Heard that dogs and elephants are the only animals that understand pointing.,Curious to dive deeper
196,Both of them are very smart and understand pointing and are better behaved than many children I see in stores.,Happy
196,Ha!  My husband use to volunteer for an organization that trained service dogs for aiding the disabled.  Think they were labradoodles.  He said they were very smart.,Neutral
196," I used to think that my dogs saw in black and white but i have since learned that they aren't color blind and in fact can see colors, just not as many as a human.",Surprised
196,That's pretty interesting.  Wonder what colors they can see!  My daughter so desperately wants a dog she spent an afternoon writing a poem about why she deserves a dog.  A for effort. Lots of rhyming like Dr. Seuss.,Neutral
196," Oh, get that baby a doggie.  Every kid needs a dog, it'll help teach her responsibility and accountability. Speaking of poetry, do you like it?",Curious to dive deeper
196," Yeah, those were some of her arguments.  Kinda dreaded learning the classics.  I remember having to memorize The Raven.",Neutral
196," Funny, I remember that one, as well as Anabelle Lee.  You know Edgar Allan Poe only got $9.00 for The Raven?",Surprised
196,Dang!  No wonder he wrote a lot of depressing stuff. Great chatting with you.  Give your dogs a hug for me and I'll consider getting my kids a dog.  Take care!,Neutral
196," You too, friend.  Enjoy the rest of your night!",Happy
197," Hey, do you care a lot about fashion? ",Neutral
197,Yes I know a lot about clothing actually. In fact I'm wearing some right now LOL what about you,Curious to dive deeper
197,I know a decent amount although I do not care the most about fashion. Did you know that Apple had a clothing line back in 1986?,Surprised
197," No I didn't know that. I wonder what those clothes look like? They're probably very colorful like the pilgrims original clothes, not the black clothes that they wore for special occasions",Surprised
197," I wonder what apples clothing line looked like too. And speaking of Pilgrims, I thought that it was the exact opposite as what you said. I guess it is just me.",Surprised
197,A lot of things are the opposite of what you would think. Like how ripcurl says on their clothes that they are made in China when in fact they are made in North Korea,Surprised
197,I am not suprised that they tried to keep that a secret. I do not think anyone would buy something that was made in North Korea!,Surprised
197," Nope I definitely would not! I also wouldn't buy clothes from unclaimed baggage, there's a store in Alabama that actually sells that stuff",Surprised
197,Really? I would not trust that store. Professional Ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week!,Surprised
197,That is impressive! How often do you wear shoes by the way? I want to try on the shoes that are 5000 years old and actually perform better than current shoes,Curious to dive deeper
197," I am sure that those shoes are also much, much more expensive to manufacture although trying them on would be a pretty neat experience",Happy
197," They probably smell bad because they're so old, we should put dry tea bags inside of them because that will absorb the odor LOL",Happy
197,I do not think that is the best idea..... It would probably damage the shoes. Maybe spraying it with bottle of febreeze would be better...,Curious to dive deeper
197," Speaking of clothes, what do you think about shirts? Did you know that you can wear a necktie under the collar with a dress shirt? I do that for work",Surprised
197,I occasionally do that. The pallbearers wore blue shirts and khaki pants to billy mays funeral. Disrespectful much?,Disgusted
197," Haha that is either very disrespectful or very respectful LOL. I wish I lived in Hawaii though, you can wear an Aloha shirt instead of a suit and tie there",Surprised
197," That is probably because it is much warmer there. Nevertheless, I also wish that I could show up to work in a random t-shirt!",Happy
197," Yep I agree with you! I think it's cool that the polo shirt was not invented by a polo player, but was actually invented by a tennis player, very interesting",Surprised
197," I wonder why it was called the polo shirt then, shouldn't it be called the 'tennis shirt'? Although that does sound quite weird",Curious to dive deeper
197,Yes I think Polo sounds better haha. Also interesting that the man who invented that shirt was nicknamed the crocodile and that's why polo shirts have that crocodile logo on them,Surprised
197,Ah. China's cultural revolution gang revolved around layering as many shirts as humanly possible,Surprised
197,I wonder what that looked like! are you aware of the difference between a button up and a button down shirt?,Curious to dive deeper
198,DO you like poetry?,Curious to dive deeper
198,I love it. Have you read the poem Chaos?,Curious to dive deeper
198," I have not, what is it about?",Curious to dive deeper
198,It is a poem with 800 irregularly pronounced words and it has 274 lines,Curious to dive deeper
198,WOw that is awesome. Have you heard of that poem that is different when read normally and the backwards?,Curious to dive deeper
198," I cannot say that I have, how different?",Curious to dive deeper
198,Normally read is depressive and backwards is inspiring,Curious to dive deeper
198,WOw cool. Do you know who CS LEwis and TOlkien are?,Curious to dive deeper
198,Yes they are both great authors from their time,Curious to dive deeper
198,Yes and they had you laugh you lose games over bad poetry,Curious to dive deeper
198,WOw that must have been hard for them to keep from laughing,Curious to dive deeper
198,True. Did you know art and poetry were olympic sports?,Curious to dive deeper
198," Nice, that is cool. Do you like dogs?",Curious to dive deeper
198,I love dogs. They can learn up to 1000 words,Curious to dive deeper
198,Nice and they also understand pointing like elephants do too,Curious to dive deeper
198,Yes and they also are better at reasoning than the chimps,Curious to dive deeper
198," Nice, They also have 12 different blood types and have blood drives",Curious to dive deeper
198,Nice. They drink with their underside of the tongue,Curious to dive deeper
198,Wow neat. Google have it in their code of conduct that they are a dog company,Curious to dive deeper
198,SO cool. Nice chatting with you,Curious to dive deeper
198,Same here,Happy
199," Hi partner, what type of shoes do you like?",Happy
199," I like all kinds of shoes. I prefer shoes that are more fashionable. But, I haven't been able to afford them in recent years. ",Sad
199,What type of shoes do you think best for protecting one's feet?,Surprised
199,I think any shoes with good soles are the best for protecting your feet. You need good support.,Curious to dive deeper
199,I have little arch in my feet and I am seeking comfortable shoes. Do you have any suggesting?,Curious to dive deeper
199," I think the higher end shoes have better support in the soles. But, if you can't afford better shoes, you can always add sole supports in the shoes. ",Curious to dive deeper
199," Yes, I agree, I am referring to steel toe work shoes. Would you spend $15.00 to have a piece placed under your shoes?",Neutral
199," No, I don't think so. I think many steel toed shoes already have the pieces in place. ",Curious to dive deeper
199," Another question, did you know that a tea bag can absorb unpleasant odor in shoes?",Surprised
199," No, I didn't. But they can remove smells from gym bags, too. That's a good way to get those smells out. I used to wipe mine out with a Lysol wipe. ",Surprised
199,Would you wear clothes made from animal skin?,Curious to dive deeper
199," I wear leather shoes, and they are made of animal skin...so I guess the answer is yes. Would you?",Curious to dive deeper
199," Yes, if it's made from leather, but I had to wear clothes with gator skin. I guess it's a mind game with me.",Sad
199,It seems people think it is acceptable to wear some clothes from certain types of animal skin but not others. It always reminds me of the movie 101 Dalmatians. Did you see that movie?,Curious to dive deeper
199," I saw about 15 minutes, but I didn't get the understanding of the movie.",Neutral
199,I really liked the movie. The main point of the movie was that Cruella DeVille was trying to make a coat out of puppies.,Curious to dive deeper
199," Ok, I don't mind killing animals for food, but I dislike killing for clothes, when there are many other material used to make clothes.",Sad
199,What is your favorite kind of fabric?,Curious to dive deeper
199,Cotton is my favorite fabric. I think about 85% of our clothes are made from cotton.,Curious to dive deeper
199," I like cotton a lot, too. I'm not a big polyester fan. I feel that the fabric feels fake. Also, it scares me that my clothes could be flammable. ",Curious to dive deeper
199,You are right. I agree with you.,Happy
199,Can you believe that there is a store in Alabama that only sells clothes found in unclaimed airport baggage? That's weird.,Surprised
199," Yes, that is weird, to sell clothes worn by don't know who or whom these clothes belongs to. ",Disgusted
199," Exactly! You never know what happened in those clothes. That's what I always say about clothes at ""vintage stores,"" too. You don't know what happened in children's clothes...especially the pants. ",Disgusted
199," These are all the questions I have for you, thanks",Happy
199,Thank you. Nice talking with you!,Happy
199,Thanks,Happy
200,hi,Happy
200," Hi, how are you?  Are you a music fan?",Curious to dive deeper
200,i am good...,Happy
200,Me too.  Do you ever listen to things on LP?,Curious to dive deeper
200,Yes...... when i was in clg,Happy
200," I still have one at home and some of my grandfathers old records, but for most of my music I ve moved in to the 20th Centruy and gone with CDs and mostly MP3.",Curious to dive deeper
200,thats amazing......,Happy
200,Do you have a favorite album?,Curious to dive deeper
200," castle of glass, my favorite ",Happy
200," Im a big fan of Dream Theater's recent work The Astonishing.  It doesnt quite hold up to NWA's work or Dark side of the moon in terms of popularity, but I like it.",Curious to dive deeper
200,thats great..... i listen to their songs abut to be quiet frank i dont know them as you do........,Happy
200," They are a little more obscure, kind of like Ricky Gervais, who was actually a pop singer in the 80's.  I had no clue about that.",Curious to dive deeper
200,best music was from the 80's.... all kinds...... wish we were born then.,Happy
200," Very true, a study from 2012 even proves music has become more similar in terms of musical construction since the 60's.",Curious to dive deeper
200,thats good news....... but nothing to beat a classic,Surprised
200,Like We are the Champions being voted the catchiest pop song ever.  I cant think of a person who hasnt heard that one.,Curious to dive deeper
200,Queen i a legend like he used to mention...... lots of his songs are my energy boosters,Happy
200," Freddie is probably one of the most iconic singers of all time.  All of their music is just fantastic.  The new stuff, even the k-pop band  Moranbong Band, which is top in Korea doesnt hold a candle to what was done in the 80-90's",Curious to dive deeper
200," absolutely....... songs  like another one bites the dust, Crazy little thing called love, i want to break free, we will rock you and of course bohemian rhapsody .... legendry",Happy
200," I find it hard to believe Linkin Parks ""hybrid theory"" is the best selling album of the 21st century.",Curious to dive deeper
200," its really good , paper cut, with you,  runaway...... good songs",Happy
200," I like their music.  I think it is really neat that NWA Straight outta compton was the first album to ever go platinum, and that is with out airplay or a major tour to support it.",Curious to dive deeper
200,I agree...... they are good.,Happy
200," Well, I must get going.  It has been nice chatting with you today.",Neutral
200,same here.....,Happy
201," hello, do you use netflix?",Curious to dive deeper
201," Hello, yes I do! Sometimes I use the hour long fireplace video at home. Do you like Netflix too?",Curious to dive deeper
201," I love netflix, so many shows and movies in there. Do you remember blockbuster?",Curious to dive deeper
201,I do! I wonder if Netflix and Blockbuster ever could have done a partnership or something like that.,Curious to dive deeper
201,Well Blockbuster had the chance to buy it and passed on it. bad decision,Curious to dive deeper
201," Definitely a terrible decision, now Netflix has all these great selections. Last I checked they have almost 150 movies with perfect ratings on Rotten Tomatoes.",Neutral
201," Yesh for sure, and they offerd it to blockbuster for only $50 million",Curious to dive deeper
201," That would have been a steal for sure. I wonder how much Netflix pays their taggers, who have to watch and label the content.",Curious to dive deeper
201,Hmm good question. Do you know how netflix came about?,Curious to dive deeper
201," I believe they started off with DVD sales and rentals, and eventually transitioned into streaming media. I wonder how they improve technology from here.",Curious to dive deeper
201,Yeah and then the owner of netflix was fine $40 for a late fee and got sick of it,Curious to dive deeper
201,It's interesting how people get inspiration for things. IMDb is actually older than the first web browsers on the internet.,Curious to dive deeper
201,That is truly very cool. Did you know netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in north america?,Curious to dive deeper
201,I never knew that! I wonder if it's similar for other TV/movie platforms. Are you interested in cinematography in general?,Curious to dive deeper
201,Yeah I am. Do you know who pioneered the wide-angle cameras?,Curious to dive deeper
201," I am not sure actually, I know Nicolas Rehn was a pioneer in high-contrast cinematography to see what's happening on screen.",Neutral
201,The guy who pioneered it was the chinese-american James WOng,Curious to dive deeper
201," Ahh ok, it certainly must have been a significant achievement. Are you interested in film ratings? I use review sites a lot.",Curious to dive deeper
201,Yes I like to refer to IMDb. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
201," I do too, although sometimes they can be inaccurate. Shawshank redemption wasn't very commercially successful yet it's one of their highest rated films ever.",Surprised
201," Yeah, you never know , right? Nice chatting with you.",Happy
202,hey there what do you think of planet earth?,Curious to dive deeper
202,It's a nice place. I've lived there my whole life. I'm pretty attached. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
202," haha ya me too, sad to think that 80% of the natural forests have been destroyed though",Sad
202,Only 20% more to go! We are a destructive species. Can seem to protect things that we need to survive. And we've been here just a short time.,Neutral
202," thats true, if history were a 24 hour day, humans have only taken up about 1 minute of time",Surprised
202,The day has been getting longer. It was only 5.5 hours. Soon it'll be so long that we'll have a 20-hour workday. I bet people will want more vacation.,Neutral
202," that is wacky, will the day continue to get longer? like a 40 hour day at somepoint?",Curious to dive deeper
202," Maybe in billions of years. Humanity will be long gone, having cut down all the forests and filled the oceans with plastic.",Neutral
202," ya that is sad to think about, also sad we'll have run out of helium by the year 2100",Surprised
202,We'll get our helium from fusion reactors. Every kid can have party balloons.,Neutral
202," haha well I hope so. It's pretty silly there is an ambassador to extraterrestrials at the UN, I want his job",Surprised
202,I think you have to know somebody. It sounds like it involves few duties. Mostly waiting.,Neutral
202," haha ya, lots of waiting and doing nothihng, have you ever ridden a horse",Curious to dive deeper
202," Nope, never ridden a horse. Haven't eaten one either.",Neutral
202," haha nope I have ridden one, I guess they evolved over like 50 million years",Surprised
202,They went from multi-toed to single-toed. I guess they were more useful to humans that way.,Neutral
202," ya I think so, they became really widespread about 3000BC, so kind of a long time",Surprised
202,Interspecies utility is interesting. Dalmatians are associated with firefighting because they would calm  the horses.,Neutral
202,that's nice of them. did you knw clint eastwood was allergic to horses?,Surprised
202," Yeah, he acquired an allergy later in life. Very odd.",Neutral
202,would you ride a horse to school?,Curious to dive deeper
203,Earth is amazing don't you think? So much history in its 4.5 billion years of creation.,Curious to dive deeper
203," I think it is amazing! Not only the composition and history of earth, but also its position relative to other planets in the solar system.",Happy
203," I agree, so many wonders to think we only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds on a 24 hour calendar of Earth's history.",Curious to dive deeper
203,What do you mean?,Curious to dive deeper
203," I mean that if 4.5 billion years of histoy equals 24 hours then humans have only exist for 1 minute and 17 seconds of that 24 hour period,",Curious to dive deeper
203," Oh wow! That is really neat, time really does fly! I really appreciate these tech billionaire's efforts into space exploration, like Elon Musk and his bold initiative to start colonization in Mars.",Surprised
203,I heard he wants to build a supersonic vertical take off jet.,Curious to dive deeper
203," Whatever that is, it just sounds super cool! I wonder how he finds time the to do all these things, he's the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, chairman of SolarCity. It makes me seem very unproductive",Surprised
203," I know it seems like he wouldnt have much time, he is also an actor and producer, seems like he has more than 24 hours in his day.",Curious to dive deeper
203," He is an actor and producer? I didn't know that, do you know which movies/TV shows he is involved with?",Curious to dive deeper
203," He's in a production called ""Thank you for smoking""; I haven't seen it either though.",Curious to dive deeper
203," That seems a little ironic for his recent ordeal with smoking marijuana during an interview with the host and was fined, I think. His wife or ex-wife also appeared in Christopher Nolan's film, Inception.",Surprised
203,Thats Elon Musk's wife? I didnt know that!  she is a good actress.,Curious to dive deeper
203," I'm not sure which character she played, but according to the article, she appeared in it. I wonder if that movie inspired him to create any of his companies.",Surprised
203," Could be, so anyway, do you like horses?",Curious to dive deeper
203," Yes, but I would never ride a horse to school like what two high school students did on the ""no vehicles to school day"", very creative though",Surprised
203," I agree, really creative for sure, I bet they got in a lot of trouble too.",Curious to dive deeper
203," Yes, they were suspended, which seems a little harsh to me.",Surprised
203,It does seem harsh but then again the horses could lose control and create a lof of chaos.,Curious to dive deeper
203," Yes, especially if they had brought Icelandic horses, which have a fifth speed, called the tolt, which is a speedwalking unit for a horse",Happy
203,Can you imagine all the chaos? Another cool fact is that Clint Easthood is allergic to horses.,Curious to dive deeper
204," Hi, how are you? Do like horses?",Neutral
204," Hey there I love horses. Even though I'm allergic to them they are still very fun to ride, what do you think",Curious to dive deeper
204," You're allergic? Are you Clint Eastwood? LOL. I've never ridden a horse, but they seem like majestic animals.",Neutral
204," I wish I were Clint Eastwood! But I never knew that Iceland actually has a specific horses with a fifth speed, other horses do not have this ability for some reason",Surprised
204," I don't understand the speeds. Trot, gallop, ??? What else is there?",Neutral
204," yes its something called Tolt, I don't know exactly how fast that is though lol",Surprised
204," I guess they have used horses there for many purposes. What do you think of the two high school students who rode their horses to school on 'no vehicles to school day', and got suspended?",Neutral
204,I think that was genius but pretty dumb that they got suspended haha. What do you think about Dalmatians? Do you know how they are related to horses,Curious to dive deeper
204,I know that they are used by firefighters. I heard that they were deaf or something.,Neutral
204,Yes a lot of them are actually deaf. What do you think about Elon Musk by the way? I know that's a change of topic haha,Curious to dive deeper
204," That is a change of topic. He is not a dalmatian, or a horse, or deaf. I think that he is ambitious and trying to create new technology. You?",Neutral
204,Yes he seems very smart and also very ambitious. I think he has a dog but it's not a Dalmatian though haha. His wife also appeared in the movie Inception by the way,Surprised
204,I thought he got divorced? Is he still married? She must be pretty.,Neutral
204," I think he is still married. I'm not sure what she looks like though, did you ever watch the movie thank you for smoking by the way?",Curious to dive deeper
204," Yes, I did. A long time ago. An interesting film. I like Aaron whatshisname. ",Neutral
204," Yes I did like that movie, Elon Musk apparently produced it and I forgot that he acted in it too",Surprised
204," I'll have to check for that. He is a talented, intelligent guy. ",Neutral
204," Yep absolutely. I love that he wants to create a vertical take-off jet, that also is electric, I think that would be cool I would love to have that haha",Surprised
204," His ideas are astronomical. Anyway, great chat! Have a good night! Go watch Thanks for Smoking again.",Neutral
204," Yes I'm going to check it out very soon, I'm going to keep my eyes peeled for Elon Musk haha. also I'll keep my eyes peeled for his rocket that will colonize Mars haha",Happy
204," Yes, I will wait for Elon to travel on it first though before I go. Talk to you soon!",Neutral
204," sounds good, I'll be waiting for Spacex!",Happy
205," Earth never stops to amaze me, it was formed over 4.5 billion years ago and there is still much to learn about our planet",Curious to dive deeper
205,I know what you mean.  It is the only object known to have life and we need to know why that is.,Neutral
205," I agree, we must find life in other planets if we want to survive as a species, its sad how 80% of the forests have been destroyed by now",Sad
205,That is definitely sad and very troubling.  It makes me wonder what will happen to the polar regions with all of the ice.,Neutral
205,Global Warming happened to them and if we dont start caring about our planet we might need to find another one soon.,Curious to dive deeper
205,Already things are changing.  Did you know that there will be no helium on the planet by the end of this century?  Not only are we losing plants and animals but now we are losing elements.,Neutral
205," I did not know that, I wonder how that will affect us, im sure it will have hidden consequences on life on earth and to think we account to only a small portion of earths history",Curious to dive deeper
205,I imagine it will have consequences too.  I've heard that when the earth was first formed a day was only just over 5 hours long.  That would be weird.  I guess that means the planet used to be closer to the sun?,Neutral
205," Yeah, it seems that way, or maybe rotated at a bigger speed, you know we  have an embassador in case aliens arrive to the planet or try to make contact with us.",Surprised
205," I didn't know that!  That's actually pretty cool!  I hope he or she is friends with Elon Musk. At the rate he is going, he'll find life before the government does.  He's already planning a colony on Mars.",Neutral
205," Elon Musk is a genious, hopefully he is successful with his colonisation plan, he is also an actor you know",Curious to dive deeper
205,I didn't know that.  I knew he co founded paypal but I had no idea he acted as well.,Surprised
205," Yeah apparently he acted in a thank you for smoking sketch, and his wife is an actress as well she was in the movie Inception",Happy
205,Impressive.  I like that he is into solar energy.  He inspired a solar company and now it's part of Tesla.,Neutral
205," He is looking into the future that is for sure, he also wanted to build a vertical take off jet for passangers.",Curious to dive deeper
205," That would be different. I wonder if it would have benefits that the normal way doesn't.  You know he thinks outside the box.  When he wants to do something he just does it, like shooting a cheese wheel into space.",Neutral
205," That is an absurd way to waste money lol, shooting a cheese wheel into space! amazing but at the same time wasteful.",Curious to dive deeper
205,If you got it why not?  He is worth over 20 billion dollars after all.,Neutral
205," Yeah I guess so, just seems like a waste with all the poor families and kids without homes in the world, to think Musk was born in 1971, he sure has taken advantage of his time on earth",Sad
205,He really has.  I think he can be inspiring.  I can see how it could be wasteful to spend money like that but on the other hand he shows people to just do what they want with what they have.  It's a lot like Galileo back in the day building a telescope.  To me it's a way to say give your imagination free reign and try stuff.  Tesla is an electronic car company that he founded in the day and age where the big automakers dominate but he is giving it a try.,Neutral
205," Yeah I guess his contributions to socitety are bigger, one day he will be remembered as Galileo and other historic figures.",Curious to dive deeper
206,Have you ever seen the movie Snowden,Curious to dive deeper
206," Not yet. I know that's about the whistle blower who escaped to Russia, right? ",Curious to dive deeper
206,Yeah founder of Wikileaks. You know they published the government's plans to destroy them.,Curious to dive deeper
206," That's right. I forgot that he found Wikileaks also. I didn't know that, but I recently learned that the government owns 86% of NV land.",Curious to dive deeper
206," That's a lot of land to be own by the government, what's their game plan, lol",Curious to dive deeper
206,Maybe Snowden knows! Apparently governments are to abide by governing principles that are to balance individual freedom and tyranny.,Curious to dive deeper
206," Yeah sounds suspect. In 2006, the us passed legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the Geneva conventions",Curious to dive deeper
206,Also sounds suspect. Did you know that Albert Einstein was asked to be Israel's president? But he declined.,Curious to dive deeper
206,That's deep. Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to invite Albert Einstein to the White House.,Curious to dive deeper
206," Yeah, and the letter was intercepted and then the invitation was declined by Flexner.",Curious to dive deeper
206,Sounds like another administration i can think of.,Curious to dive deeper
206," Einstein was very involved in American politics. To this day, his estate earns $18 million annually.",Neutral
206,He was born in Germany right?,Curious to dive deeper
206," Yes, but he was very worldly. He was also a member of the NAACP and he charged $1 for his autograph. All of that collected money was donated to charities.",Neutral
206,Well that doesn't sound too bad. This is strange though Albert einstein wrote a quote in 1938 and placed it in a time capsule to be opened in 6939.,Curious to dive deeper
206,6939. I wonder why so far into the future. He was a scientist and developed the theory of relativity so maybe he saw something happening in this distant future.,Curious to dive deeper
206," Maybe, thats too far in the future for me. It was not until the 19th century that the term scientist came into regular use after it was coined by the theologian, philosopher, and historian of science William Whewell in 1833. ",Curious to dive deeper
206,Just a little too far ha-ha. And natural philosophy was a precursor of natural science.,Happy
206,They say that Harrison schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon.,Curious to dive deeper
206,Einstein would have been in all his glory if he had the chance. And it would have been well deserved since he wrote to Roosevelt about uranium being turned into bombs.,Curious to dive deeper
206,Yeah he did a lot more than what he's best known for  mass energy equivalence formula E = mc2,Curious to dive deeper
206," Eureka! He sure did. But anyway, I enjoyed our chat! It was very informative. I hope you have a great evening.",Happy
206,you too!,Curious to dive deeper
206,Take care!,Neutral
207," Are you a science fan? did you know that the estate of Einstein earns more that 18,000,000 a year? Pretty amazing inventor!",Curious to dive deeper
207,I do love science. There is so many cool things to explore such as computers or chemistry.,Curious to dive deeper
207,Did you know that Albert Einstein was born in Germany and is best known for for his equation E= mc2?,Neutral
207,I did know that. I find it intersting he wrote to Roosevelt about nuclear energy so long ago. We tend to think of it as a modern thing beyond the A bomb,Curious to dive deeper
207,It seems ironic that scientist put men on the moon but Harrison Schmitt was the only one to actually walk on the moon.,Neutral
207,I think astronauts need a different temperment than someone who works in a lab or engineering. There has to be a sense of thrill seeking that seems to be lacking in a lot of scientists.,Neutral
207,So true. The world wide web was invented in 1989 by and english scientist working in Switzerland for a state funded research organization. . .How much it changed the world!,Curious to dive deeper
207,It really has! I think it has impacted our economy and countries in ways that are unimaginable. I wonder if they knew what they were inventing when they did it.,Curious to dive deeper
207,I am sure they had no idea! There were two geniuses that invented things without thought of how they were to be used Hertz and Maxwell.  Had this thought that curiosity shoud drive invention,Curious to dive deeper
207,I think curiousity is a great thing. The internet sure has helped with that. Imagine the information we have access to now that generations past had so much trouble accessing.,Curious to dive deeper
207," So often only governments and universities can fund the research for projects in science without an immediate need. It is kind of like an essay in Harpers magazine in 1939 titled ""The usefulness of Useless Knowledge.",Neutral
207,If only that money was put to better use.,Angry
207," It is a bit like the scientist Hertz that worked out electromagnetism. Macaroni, did very little of the science but he was credited with inventing radio! ",Neutral
207,I think the pointless project funding goes back to entitlement spending. People start to think they can spend just because they want to.,Disgusted
207,I think that was on the tails of the industrial revolution. I think that know with spending out of control only endowed universities have the luxury of funding research without a product goal.,Neutral
207,The problems lie in the facts that it is doing nothing but driving us deeper into debt as federal funding goes to these pointless projects that are driven in the name of research for research's sake and has no practical value.,Disgusted
207," That is so true now. In the days of the 30s, 40s, and fifties, the inventions such as dishwashers, air conditioners, and fax machines would drive the economy up.",Neutral
207,I think if we were to address the cost of inflation and the realities of what our government has done to the economy vs what other countries are doing we would be in a better place as a nation in america.,Angry
207," I don't think that we would have the luxuries in our homes and lives that we have now without scientist. as a sidenote, did you know that Einstein answered his own mail? ",Surprised
207,I could see that. He seemed like a very down to earth man for how brilliant he was.,Neutral
207,That he could do that and earn the Nobel Prize for Physics shows that he was somewhat down to earth.,Curious to dive deeper
207,He was a brilliant and kind man who impacted the science community in so many ways.,Neutral
208," Hello, do you follow the government?",Curious to dive deeper
208," A little bit, they own almost all of Nevada. ",Neutral
208," Yep, they own 86% of the state which is crazy.",Surprised
208," They did test a lot of nuclear bombs there, so I don't think anyone would want those areas. ",Neutral
208,Very good point. Did you know Wikileaks published the government's plan to shutdown Wikileaks?,Surprised
208," No, but it is seems logical given the nature of government and Wikileak's nature to publish them.  ",Neutral
208,True. A man in France once impersonated a government official and was able to sell the Eiffel Tower twice.,Surprised
208," Yeah, I feel a little bad for the people that fell for it, especially the first one, he was so ashamed that he did not called to police. ",Sad
208,Me too. The Norwegian government once gave $1 billion to help save the Amazon rainforest.,Surprised
208,Do you think they will succeed ? I hope so.,Curious to dive deeper
208,I hope so too. Do you know much about Einstein?,Curious to dive deeper
208,I know he was a scientist. Is he German ?,Curious to dive deeper
208," Yep, he was German. He was once asked to be the president of Israel. ",Surprised
208,Why would they ask him to be president of Israel ? He must have made a ton of money with all those posters with his face.,Neutral
208,Not really sure. I also saw he was a member of the NAACP.,Surprised
208," So he was actively for civics right, he seems a good man but a quirky one I have heard that he wrote something and put it is a time capsule that will be opened in 6939.  ",Surprised
208,He was a good man and very smart. That's cool about the time capsule. Did you know he would charge $1 for his autograph?,Surprised
208," That is a lot for the time, what did he do with the money ?",Curious to dive deeper
208,Not really sure lol. Seems a little bizarre. It was good chatting with you!,Happy
208," Good, but there are other interesting scientists to talk about like the emperor of Japan who is also a scientist. ",Curious to dive deeper
208,That's good. Take care!,Happy
209,How do you think our government is doing?,Curious to dive deeper
209," Hi, I think they are doing pretty good right now. What do you think?",Curious to dive deeper
209," I think so too, lots of drama with it, but as long as they are doing their job I am fine with it",Curious to dive deeper
209,For sure. I saw Wikileaks once published the government's plan to shutdown Wikileaks.,Surprised
209," that is awesome, that is really sticking it to the man. I wonder if they released why 86% of Nevada is owned by the government",Curious to dive deeper
209,That's a lot of Nevada they own. I bet there are tons of secret bases and things like that out there.,Surprised
209," I am sure there has to be. It is all desert, but I am sure they are doing some crazy things there",Curious to dive deeper
209," I bet they are. In 2008, the Norwegian government donated $1 billion to help save the Amazon rainforest. ",Surprised
209," Wow, that is something! I wish we did that but I think we donate billions already to other countries with aid. ",Curious to dive deeper
209,Yes we do donate a lot. A man in France once impersonated a government official and was able to sell the Eiffel Tower twice,Surprised
209," that is awesome! not once, but twice! Someone had to have gotten fired over it lol",Curious to dive deeper
209,I agree. Do you know much about Einstein?,Curious to dive deeper
209,I know he was some super smart guy and scientist. I think his estate gets a ton of money still,Curious to dive deeper
209," He was very smart. Looks like his estate gets $18,000,000 annually. ",Surprised
209," wow that is a ton of money, literally! I wonder what for. I am sure he has a ton of patents",Curious to dive deeper
209,I bet. Einstein was a member of the NAACP.,Surprised
209," that is awesome, he didn't discriminate. He lived during those times. I think he was asked to be the president of Israel also once",Curious to dive deeper
209,That's pretty cool. Did you know he charged $1 for his autograph?,Surprised
209,that is awesome! I hope he donated the money to charity or something. It was nice chatting with you!,Curious to dive deeper
209,It was good chatting with you too. Did you know the emperor of Japan is a scientist as well?,Surprised
209,wow that is pretty crazy stuff! What a smart dude! Enjoy your day!,Curious to dive deeper
210,Hi there! Do you think voting is important?,Curious to dive deeper
210," No today i don't, sorry i think it's all rigged.What about you? ",Curious to dive deeper
210," Yeah, sadly, I feel the same. Maybe the system still needs to be developed. Up until 1918 not all men in UK had the vote.",Sad
210,Right i heard that. Did you know astronauts get to vote from space?,Curious to dive deeper
210,Neat! And in India they even set up a voting booth for one voter in area saturated with lions.,Surprised
210,Guess they did want him to vote. That sounds unusually cruel.,Curious to dive deeper
210," I wonder if in India they vote what to name their garbage dumps. In Austin, Texas they voted to name theirs after Fred Durst.",Curious to dive deeper
210," Wow that is to funny, i wonder why? Another unfortunate fact is that 34% of black males will never have the chance to vote",Curious to dive deeper
210,That's sad. And a lot of eligible voters do not show up. The turnout for presidential elections has not reached 63 percent in the last 100 years.,Sad
210,Right! heres an interesting fact since 1900 the taller candidate has always won.,Curious to dive deeper
210,Wow! So officials in Ancient Athens were appointed by lottery. They thought elections would cause oligarchy. And knowing the fact you just told me doesn't make me have faith in the system either!,Sad
210,It' supposed to be a formal group decision making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office. We know it;s not.,Curious to dive deeper
210,Do you think they should add a none of these candidates voting option for all elections?,Curious to dive deeper
210,I'm on the fence about that. I know Nevada has it but i wonder what the benefits are beside knowing who voted and who didn't.,Curious to dive deeper
210," Yeah, there needs to be electoral reform, so that fair electorial systems are put in place.",Sad
210,Right i'm with you. Did you know that one of the moons of Jupiter would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun?,Curious to dive deeper
210," Wow. Speaking of planets, I was sad when Pluto was deemed not a planet! I grew up being taught that it was!",Sad
210,I know and then all of a sudden right! I hear they discovered building block for life some 455 light years away. I wonder how?,Curious to dive deeper
210," Yeah, I'm not sure. And I always thought planets spun in a similar manner. Venus doesn't tilt so it has no seasons, and it also rotates clock wise unlike other planets.",Surprised
210,Wow! Hey there a five planets in our solar system that can be seen with the naked eye.,Curious to dive deeper
210," Cool, I want to go out right now and see how many I can spot. Have a good night!",Happy
211,Planets are pretty crazy if  you think about it,Curious to dive deeper
211," Yes, they are. I am crazy enough to appreciate them though. What interesting facts about planets do you know?",Neutral
211," Jupiter's moon ganymede would be a planet if it orbited the sun, do you know any?",Curious to dive deeper
211," I have heard that some planets dont have a tilted axis, and others spin on their SIDE. crazy, huh?",Neutral
211," wow, very crazy, what would earth be like spinning on its side lol. I heard Uranus rolls around the sun",Curious to dive deeper
211," URANUS? <chuckle> What a name! Yes, i wonder what is wrong with that planet besides its awkward name.",Neutral
211," Right lol! imagine a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at you, that is a real thing",Curious to dive deeper
211,that sounds like a terrible vacation. i would rather go that planet 455 light years away.,Neutral
211," right, I heard about that planet, it can possible sustain life right?",Curious to dive deeper
211,It might. we should get Elon to get some people headed toward the thing.,Neutral
211," Right, that could be his next venture. You think we will see a man on mars in our lifetime?",Curious to dive deeper
211," Yes, we will, but how long can they be there? and what can they do that a probe cant? ",Neutral
211," That is a valid point, I am glad someone is spending money on it. Do you think the Space Force will patrol it lol?",Curious to dive deeper
211," Um, i dont know about the Space Force. Maybe? THe govt has 22 trillion in debt. it is not a popular idea at the moment. ",Neutral
211," I think our elected president will push it like the wall, are you a fan of him?",Curious to dive deeper
211,I am not really a trump fan. the wall is going to be in the next budget. about 8 billion. i think that the 2020 election is going to be interesting.,Neutral
211," I think so too, I wonder who he will run against. I think if he wins it will show it was rigged again, but that is my opinion",Curious to dive deeper
211,The democratic field is a jumble now. it is unclear how the dems will come up with someone to run against an incumbent.,Neutral
211," I agree, there seems like there is already 20 running and I have only heard of like 4 of them. I need to research more. It was so nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
211,It has been great! Im glad that the system is up again! Have a good evening!,Neutral
211," I am too, I hope it lasts! Have a good evening also!",Curious to dive deeper
212," hi, did you vote in the last election?",Curious to dive deeper
212," Hi, how are you? Which election? 2018?",Neutral
212,The 2016 one?,Curious to dive deeper
212," Yes, I did vote. Did you vote?",Neutral
212,Yes of course. Did you know the indian government put a poll in a forested area full of lions for a single voter?,Curious to dive deeper
212,I guess the gov't needs to make sure everyone has a chance to vote. The US is different. The voter turnout for presidential elections hasn't exceeded 62.8% in the last 100 years,Neutral
212," I cannot believe more people do not get out and vote, teally",Curious to dive deeper
212," They probably feel that their options are poor. Except in Nevada.Nevada is the only state to have the ""none of these candidates"" voting option for presidential elections",Neutral
212,I like to have that option really. Did you know astronauts vote from space?,Curious to dive deeper
212,I figure they have the right. I wonder what percentage of astronauts actually vote.,Neutral
212,Maybe all of them I hope. even in uk not al men had the right to vote until 1918,Curious to dive deeper
212," Maybe you needed to own land, or have a title or something. I wonder if the same rules applied to women.",Neutral
212," I am not sure, but glad we all get to vote now. Did you know in atlanta 34% of the black male population cannot vote?",Curious to dive deeper
212," That sounds like the South. I wonder what would happen if a basketball player ran for president.Since 1900, the taller candidate has won the us presidential election 75% of the time.",Neutral
212,That is an interesting one. In ancient athens officials were appointed by lottery,Curious to dive deeper
212,I guess they didn't want rich people to have power. Randomness changes things up.,Neutral
212," I guess, but it seems it worked well for them. Do you know much about the planet?",Curious to dive deeper
212," The one that I'm on right now? Sure, I know a few things. ",Neutral
212,Well all of them I guess Like that planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mpg on 2000 fahrenehit weather,Curious to dive deeper
212," I think you'd better bring an umbrella. Anyhoo, thanks for the chat!",Neutral
212," same here, have a good one",Happy
213,What did you think of the article about the shootings in Parkland,Angry
213,I thought it was very thoughtful and sad about all the mass shootings around in FL and Las Vegas,Neutral
213,I thought it was sad too. It's a shame that people have to resort to shooting students as well as teachers. It's not even safe to go to school anymore,Fearful
213,I wish there could be non-polarizing discussions on it between society and politicians,Neutral
213,There needs to be a conversation about it. Maybe it will reach out to people and the shootings will stop. Parents shouldn't have to worry about what's going to happen to their children when they send them to school.,Sad
213,I guess it's important to vote for politicians who care about the people they represent and not lobbyists or the party line,Neutral
213," Exactly. All certain politicians care about is money.They don't care about what is best for people. If they did, things would be better and maybe the violence would end.",Angry
213," Yep, in ancient athens officials were appointed by lottery to avoid an oligarchy",Neutral
213,Maybe that should be done here in the U.S. Most likely Trump wouldn't be in office if the elections was done by lottery.,Neutral
213," No, unfortunitly voter turnout hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years so that may be why the country is in such bad shape",Neutral
213," You're probably right. Some people feel like their vote doesn't count so they don't bother. Then again, maybe the taller candidate won as the article claims. That does explain how certain people are elected",Neutral
213," I think Nevada has it right with the option ""none of the candidates"" as a voting option",Neutral
213,I think they have it right too. It gives you the option not to vote for people you don't think are good enough to be in office,Neutral
213," People vote for interesting things, Austin TX voted to rename their garbage dump to Fred Durst",Surprised
213,They really do. I wonder why they wanted to name it after him. I also wonder why all men couldn't vote until 1918,Neutral
213," I don't know, I also don't know why there are polling booths in forests filled of lions in India",Surprised
213,I don't know why there are polling booths like that either. It also never occurred to me that astronauts can vote from space,Neutral
213,That's nuts. Jupiter's moon ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun,Neutral
213,It is. I find it strange how venus doesn't have seasons,Neutral
213," Yea, Uranus is strange too since it rotates sideways",Neutral
213,Exactly. That is very strange. Just like the planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways,Neutral
213," Shards of glass and 2000 degree weather, sounds fun",Neutral
214," Hi, how are you?",Happy
214,I'm great! How are you?,Curious to dive deeper
214," Well, thanks! How is your smelling ability",Curious to dive deeper
214," It's pretty good, on par will most. I still can synthesize my own vitamin C.",Neutral
214,How is your hearing?,Curious to dive deeper
214," Hearing is pretty good. Like most humans, I have excellent distant running abilities. Well, maybe I used to.",Neutral
214,There is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans! That seems weird...,Fearful
214," I think it's 13 hertz, very low, below our threshold of hearing. Causes fear because I think it's like an earthquake sound.",Neutral
214,Reallly??? That's impressive knowledge! Do you know anything about ribs,Curious to dive deeper
214," I've read that they grow back stronger after they get broken, but I haven't tested that out myself.",Curious to dive deeper
214,Yeah. I know if you smoke them with BBQ sauce for 2 hours on 180 they are delicious...,Happy
214," That a good tip, but they probably won't heal well after that. ",Neutral
214," No, I am not good for the healing portion of ribs. I am on the other side of the healing line. I wonder how many ribs a black swallower fish can eat...",Curious to dive deeper
214,Times times their weight? They would get kicked out of the smorgasbord.,Neutral
214,Yeah! They would do some damage... I wonder how they would consume water?,Curious to dive deeper
214,I don't know whether they are freshwater or saltwater fish.,Neutral
214,That would make the difference. I kknow they do not have necks...,Happy
214,The humble seahorse is the only fish to have a neck. But it's not immortal!,Neutral
214," Is there anything that is immortal, besides Hulk Hogan?",Curious to dive deeper
214," There is a breed of jellyfish that's immortal. Probably goes by the nickname ""Hulk Hogan.""",Neutral
214,HA! Nice chatting with you!,Happy
215,It is amazing how a certain scent can ellict specific memories from throughout your life isn't it?,Curious to dive deeper
215," I know, I can catch a faint smell of something and be reminded of something from 20 years ago.",Neutral
215," Yes, like a summer rain always reminds me of walking through the woods as a boy.  It's too bad we can't replicate those scents and be reminded of our childhood all of the time.",Happy
215," I've never thought about it, but I suppose we don't have names for smells, just where it comes from.",Curious to dive deeper
215,That's true I refer to a damp basement smell as moldy but why not refer to the smell of onions as 'yuk'?,Curious to dive deeper
215," It's difficult to imagine having names for each smell, as we have for colors.  I'd think there were too many.",Curious to dive deeper
215," Yes, but imagine if the defining term could relate to the listener not only what the smell was precisely but perhaps even it's location. Maybe other languages allow for more descriptive labels.",Curious to dive deeper
215," I suppose if you have to survive, partially because of your nose, it makes sense to be very specific.",Curious to dive deeper
215,I would think so. I suppose it has validity to convey something with just one word that lets everyone know everything about it. I think it might be difficult if you were to use a smell word with someone who had never smelled that scent before.,Curious to dive deeper
215," The Semaq Beri speakers take it seriously, especially with the brother and sister thing.  They'd struggle in the city.",Surprised
215,Ha! They would indeed. It is funny how different cultures have taboos that make no sense to anyone but them. Whenever I smell a certain perfume I find myself back in time to my school days and the girl I used to love.,Curious to dive deeper
215," I guess we have the ability to use our noses in the same way, we just don't have the need.  There's not the peril for us.",Curious to dive deeper
215," True. Not many wild predators around to threaten us. It might be interesting to know their names for smells and try to correlate them into our culture, would they mean the same or not.",Curious to dive deeper
215," It seems it very specific to what you do, like the difference between horticulturists and hunter-gatherers.",Curious to dive deeper
215," Yes, and culture. If I say to you that an object smells like (.......), you would in all likelihood have a very good idea of what I'm referring to based on shared experience.",Curious to dive deeper
215," Avoiding mixing odors seems very extreme, I can't imagine cooking at home if I have to use different burner for each meat.",Surprised
215,That would indeed be a hardship. When I cook I'm always using the simplest most direct way to get fed. A lot of the time that involves a can and one pot.,Curious to dive deeper
215," I wonder what they'd make of some of the exotic cuisines like Indian, Thai or Vietnamese cooking.",Neutral
215," They would be adding to their dictionary I think. Some smells give me the willies, like fish. I hate the smell so whenever I walk into someone's home that has been cooking it I get sick to my stomach, so maybe they are on to something when they don't mix odors. ",Curious to dive deeper
215," Speaking of fish, did you know there was an immortal jellyfish?",Surprised
215,I heard that but wonder how they determined it?,Curious to dive deeper
215," Yeah, I guess there is no way to prove it.  A lot easier to prove a seahorse has  a neck",Curious to dive deeper
215,Yes. Maybe the jellyfish in question regenerates itself constantly so they just infer that it's immortal.,Curious to dive deeper
215," Another surprising fact is the burning of books by the FDA, I thought the US was against censorship",Surprised
215,I did too. What was the subject matter and when did it happen?,Curious to dive deeper
215," I have no idea, I'd guess the thirties or fifties.  Some kinds of novels with problematic themes",Curious to dive deeper
215,Probably of a sexual nature. Many people seem to think that leads to corruption.,Curious to dive deeper
215," Well, it was good speaking to you.",Neutral
216,Hello! Do you like to read?,Surprised
216," Hi, yes I like to read both Fiction and not fiction, what about you?",Happy
216,I'm into non-fiction more than anything. I wonder what types of books the FDA burned back then.,Surprised
216," Wow, they really did a big act of censorship, it was six tons of books",Happy
216,That is one big stack of books! I wish I could have watched the olympic events of literature back in the day!,Curious to dive deeper
216,That is right along with music and painting!! And it was until last centuries!!,Happy
216,That is so crazy! I didn't even know romantic kissing was a fairly recent development in literature! Where have I been!,Surprised
216," Wow, And it was not mentioned frequently in greek literature",Happy
216," Those stories were still amazing though even without that haha. I wonder if they ever wrote about humans losing their body hair 240,000 years ago?",Curious to dive deeper
216,LOL who knows!! but I found crazy that there is  a contest to come up with the worst opening sentence of a novel,Happy
216,I'm sure there have been many dandies! I bet Winston Churchill wasn't in that since he won a nobel prize in literature.,Surprised
216,Yes he did not earn a peace nobel prize!,Happy
216,You would have thought that is what it was for! I sometimes wonder what sound frequency causes fear in us?,Curious to dive deeper
216," Wow, I guess they use those frequencies in suspense and terror movies! but did you know we could re-grow a rib",Happy
216," That is crazy that we can! I wish we could regrow hair lol, and vitamin C but we can't, but everything else can!",Curious to dive deeper
216," That would be awesome! The rib we could grow in 2 to 3 months, there must be something to regrow hair, we just have to discover it!",Happy
216,I agree! We need to get on the immortal life like a breed of jellyfish is!,Surprised
216," That is amazing! and about sea creatures, did you know only the seahorse has a neck?",Happy
216," That is hard to imagine with all of the breeds out there, but very cool! Fish are just crazy!",Surprised
216,Did you know that there is a difference how fresh water and salt water fishes drink water?,Happy
216,Isn't it something with osmosis? I'm going to look more into that. Have a great day!,Curious to dive deeper
217,How familiar are you with the hunting and gathering culture people used to have?,Neutral
217," Not too familiar,      Although I've read a bit from researcher Nicole Kruspe discussing odor.",Curious to dive deeper
217," Although our sense of smell may not be as developed as some species, odor played an essential role in our survival. However, odor is unique in that people don't name the specific odor itself, but rather what it reminds us of.",Curious to dive deeper
217," Interesting.   Western scholars dismissed scents as unknowable, or at least unnameable for millenia.",Surprised
217," True, but recent studies by Majid found that the Jahai, who are hunter gatherers still, are able to identify these odors by abstract names. It seems that these hunter gathers & horticulturalists can identify odors, unlike the rest of their world due to their unique cirucmstances.",Curious to dive deeper
217," True, Kruspe and Majid propose that, when people settle into, say, horticulture or postindustrial society, other senses become relatively more important than smell. ",Surprised
217," McGann states that this ability to distinguish the differences in odor receptors would play a greater role in a more natural, wild environment than the secure urban areas that most horicultural people live. While distinquishing complex smells may save a hunter/gather's life in the wild, it would be as much a life or death situation in most instances in an urban setting. In fact, simple odors like smelling sulfur are enough for most people to avoid dangerous situations.",Curious to dive deeper
217," Did you know that Humans (taxonomically, Homo sapiens) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina.",Surprised
217," I recently read that the defining characteristics of Hominina are bipedal locomotion, high dexterity, complex brains, and complex language.",Curious to dive deeper
217," Early hominins‚ particularly the australopithecines, whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes‚ are less often referred to as ""human.""",Surprised
217," True, but because evolutionary development is progressive, it is diffiult to define cleanly where it is apes stop being apes and became humans instead. Considering some of these early hominins were capable of using fire, displaying high intelligence, I believe they should still be consider humans or at least an early precusor.",Curious to dive deeper
217," True, they gave rise to anatomically modern Homo sapiens in Africa about 315,000 years ago",Happy
217," Rather than simply anatomy, I believe the social behaviors and communication is what distinguishes modern human. While most early hominins were capable of using tools, homo sapiens were able to use societys for protection and use their advance communication to capture even the most abstract of concepts for the exponential accumulation and spread of knowledge.",Curious to dive deeper
217," Did you know that If earth's entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds.",Sad
217,I only happened upon that information on a Did you know? video. What advantages do you believe allowed us to dominate within this small window in history?,Curious to dive deeper
217," Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a relatively larger brain with a particularly well-developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex which enable high levels of abstract reasoning and language",Happy
217," Although early hominins have similar adaptations, what do you believe made us stand out and survive while the others didn't?",Curious to dive deeper
217,A silly one is that Humans are the only mammals that can't breathe and swallow at the same time,Happy
217,What purpose do you think this serves? Is it to seperate the lungs and stomach to prevent drowning or getting food in the lungs?,Curious to dive deeper
217," Perhaps so, although such adaptaptations would be more likely to occur as gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits came to land.",Surprised
217," Speaking of fish, I recently learned that it is negatively labeled as a parphyletic group and not a formal taxonoic group since the classification isn't as clear as perhaps mammals.",Curious to dive deeper
217,Fish are pretty amazing.      There was a koi fish named hanako that lived for 226 years    Thanks for the chat!,Surprised
218,Do you like fish?,Curious to dive deeper
218," Yes, I love fish (at least eating it). I find it funny that freshwater fish only ""drink"" water through their skin via osmosis, while saltwater fish also drink water through their mouths.",Happy
218," I like to eat them too, and that is funny, have you heard of the black swallower fish before?",Curious to dive deeper
218," Well, I've heard that they can eat prey twice their length and ten times their weight, so they must be quite strong. ",Neutral
218," I agree and also a scary species, they seem like quite the predator",Curious to dive deeper
218," Yeah, for sure! I also found it interesting that a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck. I didn't even know it was a kind of fish.",Neutral
218,The only one? reallly? that is suprising I though most fish had a neck,Curious to dive deeper
218," Actually, I think what we take for a fish's neck (I've made this mistake also) is not really a neck, but more the area where their gills come out. I find it interesting also that 84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish.",Neutral
218," Sounds like a fish we have to study a lot more closely, they can be the solution to many of our health problems and the immortal jellyfish",Curious to dive deeper
218," Yeah, for sure! It's kind of funny actually, because they said that in humans, that if a human has a rib surgically shortened, that he/she can regrow a rib equally as strong as the original within only 2-3 months.",Happy
218," Humans are just amazing, we adapt for persistnace and we are the best distance runners in all the animal kingdom",Curious to dive deeper
218," Yeah, for sure! Humans do have their downfalls though, because they cannot synthesize their own vitamin c like animals and plants can.",Neutral
218," I guess its a great thing we know how to appy science, ",Curious to dive deeper
218," Yeah, for sure! One thing that humans have going for them however is their creativity. Did you know that there is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel? That's really funny. ",Neutral
218," I didnt know that, do you like to read? it does sound like a funny contest",Curious to dive deeper
218," Yes, I love reading. It's kind of funny, because architecture, literature, music, painting and sculptures were olympic events from 1912 until 1952. I don't know why those would be considered sports, but that is quite interesting.",Surprised
218," It is interesting, never considered as sports either, do you know who Winston Churchill was?",Curious to dive deeper
218," Yes, he was the British Prime Minister during WWII and in 1953 he won a nobel prize, ironically though, it was in literature and not peace.",Surprised
218,I didnt know him as much of a writter but I haver to read some of his novels and works,Curious to dive deeper
218," Yeah, he sounds like an interesting guy. It's kind of curious though, because it has been said that romantic kissing is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even in ancient greek literature. How can they explain Romeo and Juliet then? That one had a lot of kissing on the lips.",Neutral
218," Yeah one that ended with two deaths and poison, hope you have  a nice night. ",Curious to dive deeper
219," Hi there,, do you have a favorite instrument?",Curious to dive deeper
219," Hi there, I do I love the guitar and the piano. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
219,Yes I love the piano too. Once the BBC played music as they felt they did not have important news,Curious to dive deeper
219,Wow that is impressive. Freddie Mercury and McCarthy also played piano too,Curious to dive deeper
219," Yeah and they played the same piano once, freedie for bohemian rhapsody and mccarthy for hey jude",Curious to dive deeper
219,Nice that is pretty cool. Have you heard of circus galop?,Curious to dive deeper
219,Yeah that is the stress testing song for pianos that humans cannot play,Curious to dive deeper
219,There is a piano that sits on top of the highest mountain in the UK,Curious to dive deeper
219,Oh that must be the one that the climbers found when they were hiking up there,Curious to dive deeper
219," Yes that is the one. Do you ever shop online, like on Amazon?",Curious to dive deeper
219,I do actually. Did you know Jeff built a clock on a mountain?,Curious to dive deeper
219," Yes and it is supposed to run for 10 000 years. AMazon owns IMDB, pretty cool",Curious to dive deeper
219,They are everywhere now. And they have a deal with US Postal Service to deliver on Sundays,Curious to dive deeper
219,That is so convenient. And their workers seem to be really busy all day long,Curious to dive deeper
219," Yes they can walk anywhere between 7-15 miles, that is a lot of steps",Curious to dive deeper
219,That sure is. Have you ever bought from AmazonBasics?,Curious to dive deeper
219," I have, I know they are supposed to be on the lower end but I find their stuff to be pretty good too",Curious to dive deeper
219," I agree, it is pretty good. The first guy to buy on amazon got a building named after him",Curious to dive deeper
219,Yes and all he had to do was spend less than $30. What a contribution,Curious to dive deeper
219,Yeah pretty awesome for him. Do you like animals?,Curious to dive deeper
219," I do, my favorite are dogs but I also like others like cats, snakes, elephants and such",Happy
220," Hello Friend, do you like baseball?",Curious to dive deeper
220," Yea, I'm a hugh Yankees fan, I never knew a 17 year old female pitcher once struck out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig then got banned, sounds like they signed her",Surprised
220," Yes, did you know that baseball managers were uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises?",Curious to dive deeper
220,I didn't know that was the reason why managers wore uniforms but I've heard of mangers playing in the game on rare occasions,Neutral
220," Yes, did you also know that a man found $3 Million worth of 1900's baseball cards in his grandfather's attic hidden there since the 1940s?",Curious to dive deeper
220," No that's crazy, I wonder if they had cards of players on the 1908 World Series winning Cubs",Curious to dive deeper
220,That could be.  Did you also know that kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada?,Curious to dive deeper
220," No, that's an odd name. Did you know in baseball if a player catches a ball in their hat  the opposing team gets three bases instead of being out?",Curious to dive deeper
220," That's cool. Did you know that after the Chicago Cubs won the 2016 World Series, over 5 million people celebrated in the streets, making it one of the largest gatherings in human history?",Curious to dive deeper
220," No but I'm not surprised, it had been 108 years since the Cubs last won a world series",Neutral
220," Yes, and the Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win back-to-back world series, and didn't win again until 2016.",Curious to dive deeper
220," I never knew the Cubs used to be named the Orphans, I wonder why they were called that",Curious to dive deeper
220," Not sure but I know that the Chicago Cubs and the Atlanta Braves are the two oldest teams in the major league baseball, both having been founded the same year as the Battle of the Little Bighorn.",Curious to dive deeper
220," Interesting, I never knew the Cubs had pitchers with 4 and 6 fingers on their pitching hand, I wonder if those features gave them an advantage",Neutral
220," I'm not sure but in 1945, the Chicago Cubs baseball team was ""cursed"" when the stadium security wouldn't let a man named Billy Sianis stay in a World Series stadium with his smelly pet goat.  The cubs did not play in a World Series again until 2016.",Curious to dive deeper
220," Lol, spooky. Did you know that the Dodgers lost the most world series than any other team?",Curious to dive deeper
220," Yes, did you know that as of 2018 the World Series has been contested 114 times?",Curious to dive deeper
220,Yes and the AL has the edge with 66 victories compared to the NL's 48,Neutral
220,Fascinating.  Did you know that in the 1992 World Series that the US Marine Corps color guard carried the Canada flag into the stadium upside down?,Curious to dive deeper
220," Lol no, maybe the US marines were trying to get into the Toronto Blue Jays head",Surprised
220,That could be. Nice chatting and have a good night.,Neutral
221," Hi, do you like baseball/",Surprised
221,Hai. How are you?,Happy
221,Did you know why baseball managers do wear their uniforms during a game?,Surprised
221,Yes... same dress code to baseball managers,Happy
221," Yeah, if there is a need they will have to play, I  have never seen that happen!",Happy
221,oh...why are you saw that happen,Happy
221,I did play kickball when i was a child did you play as well?,Happy
221,oh really nice.. I am play football...,Happy
221," Intersting. In canada kickball is called, soccer baseball, I think it makes sense!",Happy
221,yes.. I think sports are giving knowledge.,Happy
221,Did you know baseball is really popular in japan?,Happy
221,yes.. I know.. But i don't know about baseball. Are you explain about baseball.,Happy
221," Well, baseball is a really fun sport between two teams, the offensive , who are the batters and the defensive who are in the field.",Happy
221,oh...very nice explanation.,Happy
221," Then the batter team, once they get to hit the ball, they run the bases and If they complete the bases, they score a run",Happy
221,wow...very interesting game. I will try to play baseball.,Happy
221," Yes, i agree is a lot of fun to play baseball and also to watch the world series!",Happy
221,ok... That game was really fun... I am also watch the baseball world series.,Happy
221," it is exciting because it consists of a seven game playoff, so it is not just one night, you get to extend the enjoyment many nights",Happy
221,oh... I definitely play and watch the baseball game. It's really very interesting...,Happy
221,Well you are right. I hope you have a nice day!,Happy
222,Have you heard of Doug Harey?,Curious to dive deeper
222,Wasn't he an umpire for the MLB?,Curious to dive deeper
222,Yes he just died at 87 years of age.,Neutral
222," I guess he was a big deal, and he lived quite a while. He'll be missed though",Neutral
222,He must've been an interesting character to earn the nick name 'God'.,Surprised
222,He was one of those umpires that knew what he was doing,Neutral
222," Yup, he earned his spot in the hall of fame after calling 4,673 games.",Happy
222," And five World Series, which is a big leagues in the MLB. He wasn't intimidated by anyone, it seems",Neutral
222,He was around to see some of the first world series that first started in 1903.,Neutral
222,That's incredible! Do you pay attention to baseball much?,Curious to dive deeper
222,No I did when I was younger but lost interest. How bout you?,Curious to dive deeper
222," Every once in a while. It's one of those sports I would rather play than watch. The Japanese are such big fans of baseball that they would probably take the name ""national pastime"" from the Americans if they could",Neutral
222,Yea they are usually surprised to find so many americans like it too.,Neutral
222,Enough that people used to collect baseball cards. One man found a collection in his grandfather's attic that was worth three million dollars,Neutral
222,thats a lot of money. are any managers cards worth anything? they do wear the uniform after all.,Curious to dive deeper
222," Probably only if they step in and play the game. I've never seen any of them do it, but that would be an interesting thing to see",Curious to dive deeper
222," I think that would be fun to see, like the cubs winning the championship after 108 years.",Happy
222," It would be fun to see them all play kickball sometime. In Canada, they call the game soccer-baseball",Neutral
222,I dont think a couple would schedule all 2430 games throughout 24 years for soccer baseball. like one couple did for baseball.,Neutral
222,They might if the game got enough sponsors. They could even play it in extreme conditions like in the snow or on ice. Wearing hockey skates,Neutral
222,People would watch it just for the sake of getting together.,Neutral
223," Hey how are you doing, ever have problem with the dust fallout while having your wood floors finished?",Curious to dive deeper
223," Never, lol. have you?",Curious to dive deeper
223," I haven't but if you were wondering, it's best to clean everything before you do so there is no dust to begin with.",Curious to dive deeper
223," That is a good point, start off on the right foot. I wonder if you can buy products on amazon",Curious to dive deeper
223," I'm sure you can, might be more than $27.95, that was the amount spent by the first customer on Amazon.",Curious to dive deeper
223," I heard that person got a building named after them, that would be awesome, and definitely worth the 28 dollars. I can't believe Amazon started in 1994",Curious to dive deeper
223," For sure, started as a book store. The USPS has a contract to deliver Amazon packages on Sunday. You think Amazon is getting too big?",Curious to dive deeper
223," I think Amazon has gotten so big, but I think in a good way. I just hope they turn into a monopoly.",Curious to dive deeper
223," For sure, they kind of already are. Or at least selling all that cheap stuff kind of hurts the market overall. The warehouse workers work a ton, between 7 and 15 miles a day they walk.",Surprised
223,I couldn't imagine walking that much per day. I would be in the best shape of my life. Did you know that amazon has another site that sells their returned goods at a discount,Curious to dive deeper
223," I was not aware of that, what it is called? Amazon owns IMDB too, that's surprising.",Surprised
223," I don't know what it is called, I want to check it out lol. I don't mind getting an even bigger discount on amazon goods. I wonder why the own imdb",Curious to dive deeper
223," Yah, it's just out of box stuff usually. Did you know there are no snakes in New Zealand?",Curious to dive deeper
223," New Zealand sounds like the place to be, snakes scare me lol. I don't get why some snakes give birth and some lay eggs",Curious to dive deeper
223," Yah, they're pretty messed up, it is interesting to know that the fear of snakes is engrained in our brains.",Curious to dive deeper
223,snakes are crazy lol,Curious to dive deeper
223," Truly, very crazy. I'm surprised Crocodiles are more closely related to bird than snakes and lizards.",Surprised
223,I would never have guessed that. I wonder what the relationship is,Curious to dive deeper
223," Not really sure, maybe closer to dinosaurs?",Curious to dive deeper
223," Yea I think that is it, they say dinosaurs had feathers like birds lol, that would be interesting to see for sure!",Curious to dive deeper
223," For sure, it was great chatting with you. I hope you have a good rest of the night, take care!",Happy
224,Are you a fan of baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
224," I am, I love the game! What about you?",Curious to dive deeper
224,I don't mind it. Do you know why managers wear uniforms?,Curious to dive deeper
224," Yep, because they are technically able to play for their team if the need arises. I don't recall ever seeing one play though.",Curious to dive deeper
224,That's correct. I've never seen it happen either.,Neutral
224," I've heard that up from 1981 until 2005 a married couple actually scheduled all 2,430 major league games played each year.",Surprised
224,Wow! That's some serious devotion to the game.,Surprised
224," Yeah it is. I find it fascinating that baseball is so popular in Japan. I remember watching games when I was stationed there and the crowds were amazing, even for small local games.",Surprised
224,I had heard that it was so huge over there that they are surprised that it is our past time.,Neutral
224,Did you ever collect baseball cards?,Curious to dive deeper
224,I did not. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
224,I collected them with my dad when I was a kid. I wish I could have found a collection like this one man did. He found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfather's attic. They had been hidden since the 1940s.,Curious to dive deeper
224,Wow! That's amazing. I wish I came across something like that myself.,Surprised
224,Do you know that kickball is called soccer-baseball in Canada?,Curious to dive deeper
224,I did not. That seems like an overly complicated name.,Surprised
224," Poor Canada though, in the 1992 World Series, Marine Corps color guard carried the Canadian Flag into the stadium upside down.",Surprised
224,Oh no! That was a major error. Did you know that until their recent win the last time the Cubs won the world series the Ottoman Empire still existed?,Curious to dive deeper
224,Yep that was such a huge win for them. I heard over 5 million people celebrated in the streets!,Surprised
224,I can see why. They were also the first team to win back-to-back world series but then didn't win again until the recent one which was a huge gap in between wins.,Neutral
224,The team was supposedly cursed in 1945 when stadium security wouldn't let a man named Billy Sianis bring his goat into the stadium.,Surprised
224,That is a very strange superstition for them to have. It was nice chatting with you. Have a lovely night.,Neutral
225," How's it going, do you follow baseball? The Nationals recently traded Daniel Murphy and Matt Adams to the Cubs",Curious to dive deeper
225," I don't follow baseball much, but I do think I heard something recently in the news about how the Cubs won over the Phillies? It's so confusing when they trade players for me to follow!",Curious to dive deeper
225," Yea, I guess the manager Martinez isn't doing too good in Washington and traded them away",Neutral
225,I think the Cubs have been having a lot of trouble with their player's health. I hope they can turn it around and have a good season!,Curious to dive deeper
225," Maybe, but the Cubs haven't been too lucky since they started in 1903",Neutral
225,I think I've heard about that...are they the team that one back to back and then haven't won another World Series since then?,Curious to dive deeper
225," The Cubs didn't win until 2016, they beat the Royals I believe ",Neutral
225," Oops meant won not one. I remember a long time ago they lost in a famous World Series game to the White Sox. I'm glad they won recently, as it's been a long time!",Curious to dive deeper
225," Yea, When the Cubs won 5 million people celebrated in the street, they have been waiting a long time",Neutral
225,I bet that was one of the best baseball celebrations ever! I heard that Ronald Regan was a broadcaster for the Cubs in the thirties. He had a very interesting life!,Curious to dive deeper
225," Yea, wonder if he called the infamous Billy Goat game",Curious to dive deeper
225," How do you play that? I heard that when the Cubs first started playing baseball they were the Chicago Orphans. I wonder what the story behind that is, though?",Curious to dive deeper
225," I don't know, the Cubs were founded the same year as the Battle of Little Bighorn so maybe it has something to do with the times",Neutral
225,That's a fun fact! I also hear they're called the North Siders because of where Wrigley Field is and The White Sox has their field on the South Side of Chicago. Have you ever been there?,Curious to dive deeper
225," No but I'd love to visit Wrigley field, it is one of the most historic baseball parks",Neutral
225," I hear that it's a really nice place and the culture is cool there too. In example, when the visitors hit a homer into the bleachers the cubs fans throw it back into the field! lol I'd like to see that.",Curious to dive deeper
225,THat's pretty crazy. I heard Japan has a crazy baseball culture too and are shocked to find out baseball is America's pasttime,Neutral
225,I've heard of that and wonder what the food is like at a Japanese baseball game. Do you think they'd serve both sushi and hot dogs?,Curious to dive deeper
225," Probably, I wonder if Japan has baseball cards like in the US, a guy once found 3 million dollars worth in his grandfathers attic",Curious to dive deeper
225," That sounds like a really cool find, especially if you know the right baseball card collectors. I think I'm gonna go collect some dinner. TTYL!",Curious to dive deeper
225,Have a good one,Neutral
226,Hi there! How's it going? Are you a baseball fan?,Curious to dive deeper
226,Hi. I'm doing very well thanks. I'm do watch baseball on occasion and I'm a casual fan.,Happy
226,Do you root for a specific team? Long-time Yankee fan over here.,Curious to dive deeper
226,You probably won't like this but I'm Red Sox fan. I heard that Eric Hosmer signed with the San Diego Padres  for $144 million in an eight year contract.,Happy
226,Haha you're right I don't like the Red Sox. Yes I believe the Hosmer contract was last year. I think that's going to end up being a bad contract.,Neutral
226,Me too. I think its too much money for a player that has proven himself. He is a 28 years old and he plays in the first base position and he did very well as a Royal.,Curious to dive deeper
226,By the end of that deal he will be in his mid to late 30's and nowhere ear as good. Definitely an overpay. Not as crazy as those Machado and Harper deals for over 300 million though.,Neutral
226,No nothing like that. He has won 4 Gold Gloves in his career and I will like to see him in a Red Sox uniform.,Curious to dive deeper
226," That's true the Red Sox only weakness now is 1st base. Who's their starting, Mitch Moreland?",Curious to dive deeper
226,You are correct. I also heard that Hosmer will be making $20 million over each of the first 5 seasons with the Padres.,Curious to dive deeper
226," That's smart to front load it. It's crazy how much these guys get to play baseball. It's not even as physically demanding as football, basketball or hockey.",Surprised
226,I agree with you completely. Those sports are way more physical than baseball. Did you know that the Dodgers have lost more world series championships than any other baseball team?,Neutral
226," They've been around so long, it makes sense. I think they lost a lot of them to the Yankees. It's funny prior to the cubs just winning recently the last time they won before that the Ottoman Empire still existed.",Neutral
226,Ha Ha!! The Dodgers are bad. They were crushed by the Red Sox,Neutral
226,I hate how good Mookie Betts is. I think the Yankee's will give the Red Sox a run for their money this year though.,Happy
226,I believe that to be the case. The Yankees are very talented club and always gave a hard time to the Red Sox whether we played them here or at Yankees.,Happy
226,Have you been to Fenway Park? I actually saw a game there on a trip to Boston. It's a really cool stadium.,Curious to dive deeper
226,I have been to Fenway Park a few times and its really nice and especially when we play against the Yankees. I think the Padres will be fine because their ownership is investing .,Curious to dive deeper
226," Well I don't know if you heard, but the Padres did just sign Manny Machado this year. I think his contract was like 300 million for 10 years.",Neutral
226," You're correct. They are building the team and I think they will do well in the long term but as far as them making it to the World Series, I'm not too sure about that.",Happy
226," I don't think they have the pitching yet. That's so important for winning the World Series. Anyway it was nice chatting with you, enjoy the rest of your day!",Neutral
226,You're correct. It all comes down to exceptional pitching to make it to the World Series. I was very nice chatting with you today as well. Have a nice day!!!,Happy
226,Take care.,Neutral
227," hello, do you watch baseball?",Curious to dive deeper
227," I do, it is my favorite sport. Do you watch? ",Curious to dive deeper
227,I watch it from time to time. Do you know why the managers wear uniforms?,Curious to dive deeper
227,I think they are technically allowed to play.,Curious to dive deeper
227," Yeah, good for them, do you know what kickball is called in Canada?",Curious to dive deeper
227," No, do you play kickball? I did for fun a few years ago. ",Curious to dive deeper
227,I do not play it but apparently in Canada it is called soccer-baseball,Curious to dive deeper
227," Awesome, I've only been to Canada once. Have you been? ",Curious to dive deeper
227," Yes, I have friend there so I go all the time. Nice country and nice people",Curious to dive deeper
227,Awesome. Did you know Baseball is super popular in Japan?,Curious to dive deeper
227,Yeah and they cannot believe that in the US is just a pastime?,Curious to dive deeper
227," yeah, that's awesome. The Cubs were the first team to win back to back world series. ",Curious to dive deeper
227," Nice, good for them. Do you know who used to do the schedule for major baseball laegue",Curious to dive deeper
227," No, do you? Apparently the Ottoman Empire was still in existence when the Cubs won the world series. ",Curious to dive deeper
227,Oh wow that means it goes way back then. Yeah it was a couple who did it for 24 years,Curious to dive deeper
227," Yeah, that is crazy. Apparently the cubs had a player with 6 fingers, doesn't seem possible. ",Curious to dive deeper
227," Wow, that is so interesting indeed. Did you know the women's cup had higher ratings than the world series?",Curious to dive deeper
227,I can believe it. Some of the games can be boring if you aren't a fan.,Surprised
227," That is very true. When the CUbs won in 2016, 5 million people celebrated i the streets",Curious to dive deeper
227," Wow, that must have made a huge mess. They were the first team to win it back to back, but then didn't win again until 2016. ",Curious to dive deeper
227,And the largest in history. Nice chatting with you.,Happy
228,Hi.  Can you play the piano?,Neutral
228," I can play some, I have an electric piano that I keep plugged in in my room.",Curious to dive deeper
228," Thats really cool, I can play a bit, but spend more time with other instruments.  Did you know Freddie Mercury used the same piano for Bohemian Rhapsody that McCartney used for Hey Jude in the recording studio?",Neutral
228,That's really cool. I wish the news would play piano instead of news these days like they did back in 1930.,Curious to dive deeper
228,I know. It would be far better than the slanted views they all put out today.  Id actually enjoy that.,Neutral
228,Do you like Amazon? I have Amazon prime video and it with Netflix is all I really use for tv these days.,Curious to dive deeper
228," I love amazon!  Love how quickly they can get things out, even on sundays",Neutral
228," Maybe I should get a job in one of the Amazon warehouses, sounds like a good idea to lose some extra weight since they walk 7 to 15 miles per day!",Curious to dive deeper
228," That might be a good gig for me too, trying to up my step game.  ",Neutral
228,I would love to visit the clock in the mountain that Jeff Bezos had built.,Curious to dive deeper
228," That would be cool.  It is going to run for 10,000 years so youve got time.",Neutral
228," So how do you feel about snakes? I have a pet king snake myself, and I love them.",Curious to dive deeper
228," I dont think I could own one, but Im not scared or anything.  Did you know there are No Snakes in New Zealand.",Neutral
228," Yeah that's pretty crazy. The only bad thing about owning a snake is the upkeep, it can get expensive.",Curious to dive deeper
228," I bet, is your snake one of the ones that flies?",Neutral
228," Haha no, king snakes can not do that, if they could I am not sure I would want to own one, they sound very dangerous.",Curious to dive deeper
228,Where I live a giant cobra escaped and was loose in the city.,Neutral
228," Well I hope someone caught it before someone killed it, You cant punish them for doing what is hard wired into them.",Curious to dive deeper
228," They never found it.  Dead or alive.  Yeah, I have a friend who is seriously afraid of snakes, runs away from the smallest ones.",Neutral
228," I don't have a fear of snakes, but spiders on the other hand I almost can not stand them to even be near me, hate the little buggers.",Neutral
228,Small ones dont bother me but once they get past a certain size thats a big nope from me.  Roaches freak me out.,Neutral
228," Haha yeah roaches are just down right nasty, any way good chatting with you.",Neutral
228,Same here have a good day!,Neutral
229," Hi, how are you doing this evening?",Neutral
229,Hi I'm doing well. Do you like baseball? I personally think it's really boring haha,Curious to dive deeper
229,Baseball is a slow game. I usually pay attention around the time of the playoffs. Then there's a lot of energy.,Neutral
229," Yeah it gets burst of energy, and then a lot of really boring Parts LOL. I never knew that baseball managers could actually play for their team. That's why they wear uniforms, duh",Surprised
229," Yeah, it's easier to just watch the highlight reel. The managers probably played way back in the day. Now? It would be sad. I'd want my money back.",Neutral
229,Haha yep they would probably get injured really quickly LOL have you ever played kickball when you were a kid,Curious to dive deeper
229," I played kickball. Safer than dodgeball, that's for sure.",Neutral
229," Yep I agree with you there. In Canada they call kickball soccer-baseball instead, it doesn't quite have the same ring LOL",Surprised
229,It sure doesn't. That's clunky name. Baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans are surprised to discover it's  america's national pastime. I wonder why? The sport started here.,Surprised
229," I agree with you. It's very screwy that they would not realize that LOL oh, did you hear about the man who found millions of dollars of baseball cards and his grandfather's attic? Now that is living the dream haha",Happy
229," That would be great! I would sell some of them, but keep some for a long-term investment. You never know how much they could be worth one day.",Neutral
229," No you're right. That's why I don't throw anything away. And it's also why my house is a mess LOL. One thing I don't understand is why the MLB used a married couple for 24 years to schedule all their games, why wouldn't they use a computer",Surprised
229," The couple probably used some kind of technology, but I bet they had a friend at the MLB head office. Maybe they were inexpensive? I dunno.",Curious to dive deeper
229," haha ya, and they did that until 2005, very crazy!",Surprised
229,That's a long time. Do you watch the World Series? I try to.,Neutral
229,No I can't say that I do haha. I like I said I don't really watch sports that much. I know that it is the best-of-seven games correct? Who do you want to win this year,Curious to dive deeper
229,I like it when an underdog wins. I'm tired of big city teams with big payrolls winning. The Series should bring out the best in the fans and the players.,Neutral
229,Yep I like that too. What's crazy is that Babe Ruth tried to steal a base in game seven. That's what made him lose the 1926 World Series. Wasn't Babe Ruth really fat?,Curious to dive deeper
229," He was pretty big later on, but he was also a pitcher at one time, so maybe he was speedy. Still, stealing a base? He was a hitter, not a runner.",Neutral
229,Yep I agree with you. Pretty cool that the Cubs were the first team to win back-to-back World Series. I know that would be impressive,Surprised
229," It was impressive, but then they hit the world's longest losing streak. How? Is it a curse?",Neutral
229,Haha well at least the curse has been broken. What's also crazy is that the Women's World Cup had higher television ratings than the World Series in the United States. Personally I think soccer is even worse than baseball so I don't know how that's possible,Surprised
230," I'm not really into sports, but I learned a lot about baseball.",Neutral
230," Hello, me too, but have you heard about Philadelphia Phillies?",Happy
230,I know a little about them. They have a funny mascot. It looks like Stephen Strasburg is doing well since healing from his injury.,Neutral
230," you know that ended in a 5-1 win for Strasburg and the Washington Nationals at Citizens Bank Park and gave the team its first five-game winning streak since the end of May. I was so surprised, can you imagine 5:1...",Happy
230,That's amazing. I can't believe the Nationals have a 19 year old rookie player who is doing so well.,Neutral
230," yes that is amazing. He fell behind a couple times and got right back to throwing strikes. He did really, really well. Do you know Aaron Nola?",Happy
230,I have never heard of him. Is he a good player too?,Curious to dive deeper
230," Yes hi is. he Phillies' Aaron Nola has been one of the National League's best and is right behind Max Scherzer and the New York Mets' Jacob deGrom in the Cy Young conversation, that's the information I have learned",Happy
230,That's something. I thought it was interesting that all othe game scheduling was done through a married couple until 2005. I wonder who handles it now.,Curious to dive deeper
230," yes me either. Then it was a nerve impingement in his neck. Now Strasburg is inching back into form, one start at a time, even if most of his fastballs are still registering in the low 90s. ",Happy
230,The low 90s is pretty fast for someone with that kind of injury. I also didn't know the game was so popular in Japan.,Surprised
230," Me too, can you believe, in Japan...  I also learned that Ryan Zimmerman added a run-scoring single three hitters later and a solo home run in the fourth that sneaked just above Odubel Herrera's glove and into the bushes beyond the center field wall.",Happy
230," That must've been so awful for Odubel Herrera, to just miss catching the ball. It was probably quite a sight to see in person. ",Curious to dive deeper
230," yes I guess so... Can you believe that he Phillies right-hander never hit a stride in five innings of work, while Strasburg was only scratched by J.P. Crawford's solo homer to start the fifth?",Happy
230,I guess people sometimes have off games. Hopefully he'll be able to get out of that slump.,Neutral
230," yes that's for sure. Nationals pent the past month hovering on either side of mediocrity, trading key players to contending teams, watching their playoff hopes come and go with the summer. But the Nationals have shown a lot of life in the past five days, if only a week or two too late, I am very impressed, what about you?",Happy
230,They are turning out to be an impressive team. Hopefully they'll make better decisions and continue to play well enough to go on to the world series. I am learning quite a bit about the team in this conversation.,Neutral
230,yes exactly. do you like baseball?,Happy
230," I like watching it in person. Not so much on TV. It's more exciting to be there. I've only been to one pro game with a friend who's really into the game -- I think it was the Nationals many years ago. I don't recall who they played or what the score was, but it was a fun afternoon.",Neutral
230,Yes I like to watch it from home with my friends lol  and did you know that Baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises?,Happy
230,Wow. I did not know that. I wonder if any of the managers are any good...,Curious to dive deeper
230,it was nice to chat,Happy
231," Hello,  do you like baseball?",Curious to dive deeper
231,You bet. Do you know why the managers wear a uniform?,Curious to dive deeper
231," I believe its because they are able to play in the game if needed. Thats kinda cool,  I hope they never have to though.  ",Curious to dive deeper
231,Yeah it is pretty cool. I wonder if they do that more in Japan where they take the game more seriously,Curious to dive deeper
231,I hear that they are surprised to know that baseball is an american thing lol,Curious to dive deeper
231,Yeah it seems so. Do you know who used to do the scheduling for the major league games?,Curious to dive deeper
231," Not sure,  who?  A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in an attic!!  lucky guy!",Curious to dive deeper
231,Yeah that is amazing. It was a couple who did it for 24 years in a row,Curious to dive deeper
231," Wow, the must really love baseball!  That is a lot of time dedicated to the sport,  that is really sweet that they had something they were both passionate about though. ",Curious to dive deeper
231,Exactly because scheduling 2430 games every year is no easy feat,Curious to dive deeper
231,I know right!  Probably after a few years they developed a working system or a program.,Curious to dive deeper
231,Yeah that is a high possibility too. Do you know when the World Series was founded?,Curious to dive deeper
231,No I dont.  When?,Curious to dive deeper
231,It was founded in 1903 and at that time even the ottoman empire was in existence still,Curious to dive deeper
231,Interesting.  did you know the chicago cubs were the first team to win back to back world series?,Curious to dive deeper
231,Yes they were but then they were cursed or something because they have not won anymore since then,Curious to dive deeper
231," I hear they actually did win again,  in 2016.",Curious to dive deeper
231,Oh right when they had that huge celebration with 5 million people out in the streets,Curious to dive deeper
231," Yes,  the largest gathering of humans in history!!",Curious to dive deeper
231,That is pretty impressive. Did you know the Cubs are one of the oldest teams in MLB?,Curious to dive deeper
231,I did not! Thats cool.  ITs been great talking to you.,Neutral
232," Hello there, are you a fan of baseball?",Curious to dive deeper
232,Yes.  I was an assistant scout for the Phillies years ago.  Did you know that a married couple scheduled all 2430 games for 24 years until 2005?,Neutral
232," Wow, that is pretty cool.  And no I didn't know that but that is very interesting.  I wonder how they ever got that job?",Curious to dive deeper
232," I don't know, but it must be complicated since there are sometimes concerts and other uses of stadiums.  Also, it's too cold in some ballparks early in the season.  There is a form of baseball played with a kickball in Canada.",Neutral
232," Yeah that is true, the weather is unpredictable and some stadiums don't have roofs.  Yeah I think it is called soccer-baseball or something like that. ",Curious to dive deeper
232,It is odd that managers wear baseball uniforms.  Coaches in other sports don't wear uniforms.,Neutral
232," Yeah it is odd, but do you know why they might wear uniforms unlike other sports?",Curious to dive deeper
232,I have read that they can actually enter the game but I am not sure that I believe it.,Neutral
232," Yeah that is right, technically they can play if they need to.  Wouldn't that be fun to watch your team's manager play and bat. ",Curious to dive deeper
232," Some would do well because they were recently players, but sometimes they are over 60 years old.  Some of Japan's baseball fans are surprised that it is such a big deal in the US.",Neutral
232,Yeah I know Japanese people are really into baseball.  Did you watch the world series this year?,Curious to dive deeper
232,Yes.  The American League champ plays the National League champ and the NL is not doing so well lately.,Neutral
232,Yeah my team was one game away from representing the NL in the series.  Did you know that Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 of the series way back in 1926?,Curious to dive deeper
232,That was not a good baseball decision trying to steal that base.,Neutral
232,No that doesn't sound like it.  But I think he made up for it quite a bit.  Do you know who the first team to win back to back world series was?,Curious to dive deeper
232," Yes.  The Cubs.  The last time they won, the Ottoman Empire still existed.",Neutral
232,Yeah good call.  Are you a fan of the Cubs at all?,Curious to dive deeper
232,I do like them.  Their stadium is so old and so classic.  I guess what I said about the Ottoman Empire was wrong.  They won in 2016 also.,Neutral
232," Yeah they did, maybe that was the last time they won their back to back series. ",Curious to dive deeper
232,I live in Phoenix and the Diamondbacks won in 2001.  I could not imagine going 108 years without winning like the Cubs did.,Neutral
232,Yeah our manager was a hero for you in that final game back then.  Well I haven't seen one in my lifetime I am ready!  It was nice talking with you.,Neutral
233,Do you follow baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
233,Yes. I am a dodger fan,Happy
233,Awesome!  I like Walker Buehler.  What do you think of the Dodgers/Reds trade?  Think it was a good one?,Curious to dive deeper
233," No. They gave up too much. Puig was a pain in the neck, but one of the best defensive left fielders in baseball. The pitcher wood was a young guy who was an all star 2 years ago",Curious to dive deeper
233,I was kind of surprised when they did that trade.  Did you know baseball managers wear uniforms because they can technically play if needed?,Happy
233,Yes. I remember Pete Rose and Frank Robinson doing that,Curious to dive deeper
233,Yes.  How about the guy who found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards that were hidden in his grandfathers attic since the 1940s.  I'm not ashamed to admit that I still a few packs of baseball cards every year.  It gives me the thrill I had when I was kid opening them.,Happy
233,Yes my base baseball cards were thrown out many many years ago. I wish I had those back,Surprised
233,They were super huge there in the late 80s and early 90s but have died down in popularity since then.  Did you know kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada?,Happy
233,Yes. I had heard that before.,Happy
233,I don't know if I would like to schedule the games.  For 24 years a married couple scheduled all MLB games played each year.,Happy
233,That sounds like a heck of a big job.,Surprised
233,I would want no part of it.  Babe Ruth was thrown out stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 world series.  First time I've ever seen that fact.,Happy
233,I have never heard that before.,Surprised
233,First time for me as well.  Did you know that baseball is really popular in Japan and many fans there are surprised to find out it's known as America's national pastime?,Curious to dive deeper
233,Yes. Baseball has been big in Japan for a long time,Curious to dive deeper
233,I find it interesting how they name the teams.  Surprised we don't see that here.  We could see the Walmart Cashiers playing the Target Bullseyes. lol,Happy
233," The  Dodgers are called the Dodgers because their fans in Brooklyn Had to Dodge trollys to get to the Stadium. They were called trolly Dodgers, Then shortened to Brooklyn Dodgers",Happy
233,That is interesting!  I honestly never knew that!    The womens cup had higher tv ratings than the world series in the US.  That kind of shows the sport is on a downtrend like the cards.,Happy
233,I never Knew that. But baseball is a slow paced game. I guess the kids like faster paced sports,Surprised
233,Yes.  They are into video games now (too much if you ask me).  It's been fun talking ball with you!  I enjoyed it.  Have a good day!,Happy
234,do you like baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
234,I do and watch it quite a bit and you?,Curious to dive deeper
234,Me too. do you know why the managers wear uniforms?,Curious to dive deeper
234," I am not sure of that actually, did not notice. Why?",Curious to dive deeper
234,Yes because they can play if their team needs them to,Curious to dive deeper
234,Nice. DO you know how many balls are used during a MLB season?,Curious to dive deeper
234,Hmm I have no idea but I know that a couple did the schedule for 24 years for those games,Curious to dive deeper
234,Wow that is a lot and they use 160000 balls per season,Curious to dive deeper
234,Now that is a low. Did you hear about that guy who made 3 million from old baseball cards?,Curious to dive deeper
234," WOw no, where did he find all those cards?",Curious to dive deeper
234," In the attic, they were his grandfather's. How lucky",Curious to dive deeper
234,I know. A female pitcher at just the age of 17 once took out Babe Ruth and was banned after that,Curious to dive deeper
234,Wow that is impressive too bad and unfair she got banned though,Curious to dive deeper
234,Exactly. Women's world cup has more viewers than the Works Series,Curious to dive deeper
234,Do you know when the World Series was founded?,Curious to dive deeper
234," Yes that was back in 9013, so over 100 years old now",Curious to dive deeper
234,yeah it is pretty old. They were around when the ottoman empire was around too,Curious to dive deeper
234,Wow that feels really old. Do you know which team has lost the most championships?,Curious to dive deeper
234," Hmm I do not know that, which team is that?",Curious to dive deeper
234," That is the dodgers, poor guys must be beating themselves about it",Curious to dive deeper
234,I know. The Cubs were the only team to win back to back world series and then nothing for a long time,Curious to dive deeper
234,Wow they must have struck bad luck after that,Curious to dive deeper
235," Hello there, do you watch baseball?",Curious to dive deeper
235,I sure do from time to time. Do you know why the managers wear a uniform?,Curious to dive deeper
235,Yeah they wear them because they are technically allowed to play if it need be,Curious to dive deeper
235,Yes exactly. Do you know what kickball is called in Canada?,Curious to dive deeper
235," I think it is called soccer-baseball, is it not?",Curious to dive deeper
235," Yes it is, a combination of both games. In Japan seems to be a really popular game",Curious to dive deeper
235,Yup they are so into the game that they cannot believe it is just a pastime here,Curious to dive deeper
235,Yeah exactly. Do you know who used to do the scheduling for major league games?,Curious to dive deeper
235,I hear there was this couple who did it for 24 years in a row,Curious to dive deeper
235," That is amazing, 2430 games every year that is just too many numbers for me",Curious to dive deeper
235,It sure is for me too. THe ottoman empire was in existence when the world series started,Curious to dive deeper
235,Wow that means it started really early this whole thing with baseball.,Curious to dive deeper
235,Yes it started back in 1903. The Cubs were the only team to win back to back championships,Curious to dive deeper
235,Yes and they have not won since then so I wonder what happened there,Curious to dive deeper
235,Yeah one wonders right? Women's world cup on the other hand has higher ratings than the world series.,Curious to dive deeper
235,That is pretty impressive. The largest gathering in human history was when the Cubs won the world series in 2016,Curious to dive deeper
235,Yeah I heard more than 5 million people were put celebrating,Curious to dive deeper
235," Yeah that is insane. The Cubs are one of the oldest teams in MLB, along with Atlanta Braves.",Curious to dive deeper
235," That is pretty cool. And they have had pitchers with 4,5, and 6 fingers in their pitching hand",Curious to dive deeper
235," Nice, that sounds interesting. They are also one of the oldest teams in MLB",Curious to dive deeper
235,Yeah. They were once believe to have been cursed when security did not let a guy with a smelly goat in the stadium,Happy
236," Hello,  do you like baseball?",Curious to dive deeper
236," Hey I do like baseball! Did you know that managers can actually play baseball? that's why they wear the uniforms, just in case the need arises, then they can play for the team",Surprised
236," Yeah I did,  thats pretty awesome.  Hopefully they dont have to though,  most of them are a bit older.  Theres like 20 players on a team though,  shouldnt have the need. ",Curious to dive deeper
236," No I agree with you. Have you ever played kickball when you were in school? Apparently in Canada, it's not called kickball, it's called soccer baseball LOL",Surprised
236," I did, used to love kickball,  I feel like kickball is a more appropriate name for it,  what does soccer mean?",Curious to dive deeper
236," I know right! I definitely think that kickball is the right word. It's the best way to describe it, what would you do if you found millions of dollars of baseball cards in your attic by the way?",Curious to dive deeper
236," Wow well pay off my car and cc's,  go on a small vacation and put the rest in savings or investments,  then continue my life.  how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
236,Haha I would do something similar. Definitely pay off my student loans and everything. And probably retire LOL. I can't believe that some guy found 3 million dollars worth of those cards in his grandfather's attic though. What a lucky guy,Happy
236," I know thats amazing.  That would be really nice,  my relatives dont collect anything cool like that so Im on my own lol ",Curious to dive deeper
236," Haha yes that's too bad, mine did not either. Have you ever been to Japan by the way? Apparently baseball is really huge over there",Curious to dive deeper
236," I have a trip planned for next jan to Japan!  No I had no idea that baseball was big there,  maybe I can catch a game!",Curious to dive deeper
236,You should! I've heard that the crowds are super Rowdy haha. You're not married are you? It's weird that a married couple with scheduling all of the MLB baseball games for about 24 years,Surprised
236," Yes I am happily married!  That seems like they put a lot of time into baseball,  they must really love it",Curious to dive deeper
236,I think so. You ever watch the World Series by the way? I haven't watched it in a really long time myself,Curious to dive deeper
236," I have watched it a few times,  especially if the sf giants are in it!",Curious to dive deeper
236," So is that your favorite team? I like the Tigers, and I also like the Yankees LOL oh, did you know that the Women's World Cup soccer had a higher television rating than the World Series? And that was in the United States too, I wonder how that's possible",Surprised
236," Haha wow thats crazy.  Yes,  I love the SF Giants!",Curious to dive deeper
236,What do you think about the Chicago Cubs by the way? Apparently after they won in 2016 about 5 million people were celebrating in the streets,Surprised
236,Good for them.  I dont think they have won in a long time lol I cant imagine 5 billion people in the streets though.,Curious to dive deeper
236,Nope Chicago must have been really partying that day LOL. Did you know that they were the first team to win back-to-back World Series's?,Surprised
236,Been good chatting,Curious to dive deeper
237," Hello, have you heard that one of the chicago cubs have an employed pitcher with 6 fingers?",Surprised
237," No, The cubs are one two major teams in chicago.",Happy
237,I am guessing the second one is the Atlanta Braves.,Curious to dive deeper
237," Yes, The chicago cubs won the 2016 world series, people celebrated in the streets, making largest gatherings  in human history.",Happy
237," Well, they were the first team to win straight on the world series til 2016.",Neutral
237,The chicago cubs were the first team win back to back .,Happy
237," That is true. However, the Chicago Cubs were somewhat ""cursed.""",Curious to dive deeper
237,For this only the cubs did not play in a world series again until 2016.,Happy
237,It was right after a refusal towards a man with a smelly goat going into the stadium.,Neutral
237," Yes, I hear the new. Baseball managers wear uniform because they are technically able to play for their team when need arises.",Happy
237,I bet they get as much compensation as the other team players.,Curious to dive deeper
237,They are very fanatic for their team should win. You ever played baseball ?,Happy
237,I hardly play baseball. I watch the game whenever there is a Giants game coming up.,Neutral
237,What your Favourite game ?,Happy
237," The Giants. Unless, you're talking about sports. My favorite sport is basketball.",Neutral
237,Kickball is also called soccer baseball in canada.,Surprised
237," Yes, have you ever played kickball? Physical education teachers let the students play kickball in the states, as well.",Neutral
237," Yes, baseball is very popular in japan.",Happy
237,Do you think that baseball started in Japan or the states?,Curious to dive deeper
237,United state national sports is base ball. I know it.,Surprised
237,I see. Nice to talk to someone who has a good knowledge on baseball.,Curious to dive deeper
238," The Braves seem to have a good start on the season, they are the most rested team",Curious to dive deeper
238," Hi, how are you? I don't really know the Braves. They're a big market team, so I expect them to get marquee players.",Neutral
238," They have a good team, so there are two points of view, a well reseted team vs a team that comes into season with a lot of practice, which one do you prefer?",Curious to dive deeper
238," I would practice. I think skills get rusty. Baseball is a team sport, so they should work together. Other teams will have practiced.",Neutral
238," I  think practice is better, a well rested team might begin with some troubles, games are neccesary to adapt.",Curious to dive deeper
238," Yes, I would want people to practice. They need to prepare for the season. Did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises?",Neutral
238," Ive always wondered about that, do you know if it ever happened in a game?",Curious to dive deeper
238," I suppose back in the day one of the players was chosen to be manager. Handled both jobs. Now, not necessary.",Neutral
238," I see well the game is really popular in Japan, seems like it has a lot of fans over there",Curious to dive deeper
238,The game is very popular. I think that the Japanese have made their own version of it. Uniquely Japanese.,Neutral
238," They did? wow, they must really like it them did you watch the Wold Series last year?",Curious to dive deeper
238,I didn't get the chance to watch a lot of it. I know that the Dodgers lost again.,Neutral
238," I didnt watch it either, its a game with a lot of tradition almost 120 years since the first World Series, so 120 champions",Curious to dive deeper
238,The Cubbies won back to back WS. Then after that? It's like a curse. What should they do?,Neutral
238," They should get like an exorcism done by all religions lol, it does seem like a curse",Curious to dive deeper
238," The sports is popular here, but not around the world. The women's world cup had higher television ratings than the world series in the united states.",Neutral
238," It did? guess not only the mens category is popular then, before 1969 the team with the best record would advanced to the WS that has changed now",Curious to dive deeper
238," I think the playoffs are fun, but probably a good way to get more money. The fans don't seem to mind.",Neutral
238," So the Chicago Cubs and their curse, to think the Cubs and the Braves are the oldest teams in the league",Curious to dive deeper
238," The Braves have moved a lot, I think. Weren't they in another city?",Neutral
238," Not sure about that, but I think they were yeah. ",Curious to dive deeper
239,Do you play or watch baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
239," Hey, I've played, but honestly not a big fan. How about you?",Neutral
239," I used to follow it really closely, and played in highschool. But they changed the strike zone to be smaller so now the games are less exciting to me because I was a pitcher. ",Curious to dive deeper
239,Really? It's interesting. Do you know why baseball is popular in Japan?,Surprised
239," No i don't actually, but I hear it is popular there. Do you  know why? I'm curious.",Curious to dive deeper
239," I honestly never heard about it, but read couple minutes ago. I'm wondering is it only Japan, but any Asian country as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
239," Interesting, do you know if they play a championship game there? And if so, what is it called?> ",Curious to dive deeper
239," I have no idea. But if so, why US teams don't play aganst Japanese? lol It could the World Cup like in soccer/footaball every January 4 teams from different continents play ",Surprised
239," I don't know, curious why we call it a world series but the two countries never play each other. ",Surprised
239,Absolutely. Have you read an article about Chicago Cubs recently?,Curious to dive deeper
239," No, I didn't see it. Apparently when they won the 2016 series 5 million people celebrated. ",Curious to dive deeper
239,It also was the first baseball team to win back-to-back world series. I actually didn't know it.,Neutral
239,Awesome. They are one of the oldes teams.,Curious to dive deeper
239,True. As well as Atlanta Braves. It's wonderful!,Neutral
239,I didn't know that. The Cubs were cursed in 1945 when they would let Billy Sianis stay in the stadium.,Curious to dive deeper
239,It's sounds like a mystery. Just difficult to believe lol,Happy
239,I didn't now they were known as the North Siders. Did you know that?,Curious to dive deeper
239," It's also new fact for me, I didn't know. Honestly, I don't have good knowledge in history of  baseball. How about you?",Neutral
239," Sort of, babe Ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 of the world series and they lost. ",Surprised
239," Yes, I know that, but it was long long time ago. Even the Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time the Chicago Cubds won the World series. It was also long time ago",Surprised
239," Yeah, I'm not a big fan of Chicago to be honest. But I'm happy they won. ",Curious to dive deeper
240," Hello, do you like baseball?",Curious to dive deeper
240," Hi, I watch a little.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
240,Baseball is my favorite sport. Did you know that managers are technically able to play for their teams?,Curious to dive deeper
240,I wonder why they wore those uniforms.  I wonder if one has actually ever played?,Curious to dive deeper
240,The only one I can think if is Pete Rose who regularly played as manager. Do you have a favorite team?,Curious to dive deeper
240," My favorite team is the Atlanta Braves, from the days of Chipper Jones.  What's your favorite team?",Curious to dive deeper
240," Mine is the Dodgers. I have to admire that team that Atlanta had, their pitching staff was something else.",Curious to dive deeper
240," I hear in Japan, baseball is so popular that some Japanese people are shocked to find out that its America's national pastime.",Surprised
240,So I've heard. Do you think that Japan should ever be allowed to compete for the world championship?,Curious to dive deeper
240," Sure, why not?  They have some pretty good players, actually. ",Curious to dive deeper
240,They do. I have always been a little upset because the US always considers their sports teams as world champs but yet don't have to prove it.,Curious to dive deeper
240," That's so true! Hey, did you hear about the man that found all those old baseball cards in his grandfather's attic?",Curious to dive deeper
240,Yeah that was quite a find. I had no idea that baseball cards were so valuable.,Curious to dive deeper
240,Me either.  Did you watch the World Series?,Curious to dive deeper
240," I did watch the world series, and as you can imagine I was once again disappointed in the Dodgers. Did you know that in 1992 the US marines carried the canadian flag upside down?",Curious to dive deeper
240,I can believe it.  lol Which way does that leaf go anyway?,Surprised
240,To tell you the truth I would have to look it up. But what an embarrassment.,Curious to dive deeper
240," I know right, I think I would have googled it,, before walking out!",Surprised
240,Me too. I feel sorry for the Marine who was carrying it. I'm sure things didn't go well for him.,Curious to dive deeper
240," He probably had to scrub the latrine with his toothbrush.  Oh well, now he knows, I bet he won't forget it! Did you hear about the curse of the goat?",Curious to dive deeper
240," No, what is the curse of the goat?",Curious to dive deeper
240," Apparently, the Cubs were cursed  after security would not let a man bring his goat into the stadium in 1945.  He cursed the team and they did not play in a World Series again until 2016.",Surprised
240," Wow. Remind me to be nice to goats. Thanks for the interesting chat, and have a nice day.",Neutral
241,Are you a baseball fan? ive never really enjoyed watching on tv don't have the patience for it.,Curious to dive deeper
241," I prefer football but my granddaughter likes to watch baseball games on tv.  So, I watch with her.",Curious to dive deeper
241,That's cool! Apparently it's so popular in Japan that there surprised it's our (Americas) past time.,Curious to dive deeper
241," Yes, I heard about that.  Apparently baseball managers wear uniforms in case they have to play to replace players.",Surprised
241,I wonder if that's ever happened before? Did you know that baseball use to be referred to as the Fall classics?,Curious to dive deeper
241," I will research about it later.  No, I did not know that (the fall classics).",Neutral
241,Because in north america it is played during the fall season.,Curious to dive deeper
241,I see.  Thank you for the information.  A married couple used to schedule all 2430 major league baseball games played each year for 24 years.,Curious to dive deeper
241,That must of been pretty cool for them to do together. so the baseball season is how many games. do you know?,Curious to dive deeper
241," 2430 games, I think.  I might be wrong.",Neutral
241," That's a lot of games, no wonder pitcher arms get burned out. Just to refresh my memory a run is scored when a player legally crosses the bases, right?",Curious to dive deeper
241,A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases and touches home plate.,Neutral
241," Right, and the team that scores the most points wins. Why is the word legally used can you get bases illegally? ",Curious to dive deeper
241," I don't know why the specifically use the word ""legally"".   ",Happy
241,Now there is a such thing as stealing a base right? Some one told me that the ottoman empire was still in existence win the cubs won the world series.,Curious to dive deeper
241," My granddaughter knows much more about baseball.  I think you are right, there is such a thing as stealing a base. Babe Ruth was caught doing it to end game 7 and lose the 1926 World Series.",Neutral
241,Wow that had to hurt. I heard that the Chicago cubs were the first team to win back to back super bowls and haven;t won since.,Curious to dive deeper
241," I think what you meant was World Series since Super bowl is for football games.  Yes, you are right about Chicago Cubs winning back to back.",Happy
241,Oh right thank you for the correction. Did you know that the women's cup had more tv rating that the world series.,Curious to dive deeper
241," Yes, I heard about it.  Isn't it amazing?",Curious to dive deeper
241," It is, good for them! After the Cubs won the world series in 2016 over 5 million people celebrated in the streets. ",Curious to dive deeper
241," Yes, apparently it was one of the largest gathering in human history.  I've got to run.  It was nice chatting with you.  Have a great day!",Happy
242,Do you follow basebal? The Nationals traded Daneil Murphy and Matt Adams,Curious to dive deeper
242,Yes I do. I didn't know that. Who's your favorite team?,Curious to dive deeper
242," I'm a Yankees fan, I never knew Babe Ruth was caught stealing home in the 1926 World Serires",Surprised
242," It's surprising, you don't hear many bad things about Babe Ruth. I like the Dodgers therefore I am anti-yankee.",Curious to dive deeper
242,They had a great rivalry when both were in NY. It's crazy Babe Ruth would ever try to steal a base considering how big he was,Surprised
242,I wonder how many stolen bases he had in his career. Maybe he thought he could just run the catcher over.,Curious to dive deeper
242,That would be an interesting fact to know. It's pretty crazy the Ottoman Empire was still around when the Cubs won back to back World Series,Happy
242,Yes the Cubs have suffered from the curse of the goat.,Curious to dive deeper
242,Who knew a man with a goat could wield such great power,Neutral
242,Remind me not to make an enemy of anyone carrying a goat. I wonder if that's where the saying being a goat came from. Like Ruth was the goat after losing that game.,Curious to dive deeper
242," I don'tknow, maybe, Billy Sianis goat did stink",Neutral
242,Probably so. Did you know the Cubs and Braves started playing the same year as the battle of the little bighorn?,Curious to dive deeper
242," That is pretty crazy, I wonder if any of the people from the Battle of Little Bighorn ever saw a Cubs game",Curious to dive deeper
242," I don't know. How do you feel about people today complaining about teams that are named after Native Americans, like the Braves?",Curious to dive deeper
242," Depends on how respectful it's done, the Braves don't have a bad logo but the Indians logo is pretty messed up",Neutral
242," The native americans don't seem to have a problem with it. It's just other people, strange.",Curious to dive deeper
242," I wonder if there are any baseball controversies in Japan, baseball is really popular there",Curious to dive deeper
242," Yes it is, and they have some pretty good players. I wonder if they will ever be allowed to play for the world series.",Curious to dive deeper
242," Maybe one day, but for now it's just between the AL and NL champions",Neutral
242," True, but we Americans have a habit of declaring ourselves world champs in almost all the sports. Just doesn't seem right.",Curious to dive deeper
242," Well I got to go, nice chatting with you",Neutral
243,hey there do you like baseball? Its the game that uses a ball and a bat,Curious to dive deeper
243," I do!  And then they run around the bases, if they are lucky enough to hit said ball.",Neutral
243," Yeah that is true. It's crazy that baseball managers can actually join in the game, that's why they wear uniforms",Surprised
243," Yes, if they need to play for their teams, I dont know why that would happen, but it might be fun to watch!",Neutral
243,Yeah that could be cool. It's also cool that a man found millions of dollars worth of old baseball cards in his attic haha his grandfather and put them there and I guess forgotten about them?,Happy
243," Maybe, I should start checking my attic and see what treasures are stored up there.  I might have an early retirement.  ",Neutral
243," Haha yes I hope so! You know what is weird though? Have you ever played the game kickball, apparently it's called soccer-baseball in Canada for some reason",Surprised
243," I guess it is a pretty accurate name too, however I much prefer kickball.",Neutral
243,Uranium kickball sounds a lot better haha. What do you think about the Japanese? Apparently they are shocked to learn that baseball is actually America's pastime and was not invented in Japan,Curious to dive deeper
243," It is surprising, I bet they wonder why they are not invited to the world series either.",Neutral
243,Haha yes I bet! I think it's interesting that the Women's World Cup higher television ratings than the World Series. I don't like soccer myself.,Surprised
243,I would actually say I am a bigger soccer fan than Baseball.  Especially when it comes to world cups.,Neutral
243," Yeah I don't really like either game haha. It is crazy though that the World Series actually started back in 1903, so I do respect its long history.",Surprised
243,The cubs won the first back to back series and then didnt win again until 2016.  That is a long time.,Neutral
243," Yeah that is a long time, and apparently the Ottoman Empire was still a thing back when they first one at haha",Surprised
243," Wow, I guess I hadnt realized they had overlapped.  Did you hear about how they were ""cursed""",Curious to dive deeper
243,yes I heard about that! Its great that they finally broke the curse and 5 million people were celebrating in the streets!,Surprised
243,Supposedly it was one of the largest gatherings in Human history.,Neutral
243," ya you're right, I do like that they have employed handicapped players, they have had pitchers with 4,5 and 6 fingers! ",Surprised
243," That is really cool.  I remember Jim Abbott, the one armed player.  I wonder who he played for?",Curious to dive deeper
243," I'm not sure I havne't heard of him, but ya I also like the cubs because they, along with the braves, are the oldest MLB teams, great chat btw!",Surprised
244,Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;),Happy
244,Thanks! Do you follow baseball?  Did you know that managers can actually play for their team if needed so that is why they suit up?,Surprised
244," I heard something like that, but I wonder how often was that actually implemented in the game. Did You ever see something like that ?",Curious to dive deeper
244,I never saw that.  But I've played kickball.  Did you know that kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada?,Surprised
244,soccer-baseball ;) that's a first... is even kick ball popular in Canada ? Do You know ?,Curious to dive deeper
244,I don't know for sure.  But baseball is really popular in Japan and fans are surprised to discover its status as America's national pastime,Curious to dive deeper
244,In Japan ? Are You sure ? I didn't know Japan played baseball. Did you ?,Curious to dive deeper
244,Yes! They play well at the Little League World Series.  Did you know that Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 and lose the '26 world series with his team only down by one run,Surprised
244," yeah, Mr. Ruth was quite a legend... have You watched games with him ? Pretty exciting thing to see...",Curious to dive deeper
244," I've seen movies.  In the 1992 World Series, the U.S. Marine corps color guard carried the canada flag into the stadium upside down",Surprised
244,wow... that was the last time he did that probably... I hope it was not intentional... ;),Curious to dive deeper
244,The Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win back-to-back world series and haven't won since,Curious to dive deeper
244," wow, this must suck for them and their managers ;) such high expectations every year probably and then bum... back to square one...",Curious to dive deeper
244," The Cubs have had pitchers with a varying number of fingers including 4,5 and 6.  Do you know any of those pitchers?",Surprised
244," sorry I don't, do you ?",Curious to dive deeper
244," No not sure, but one team had a one-handed pitched who did an amazing job named Jim Abbott",Surprised
244,not bad... I'm sure that one hand was insured for a lot of money ;),Curious to dive deeper
244,The Braves hadn't been in the playoffs for a while but made it this year.,Happy
244," Good for them, were You cheering for them ?",Curious to dive deeper
244,No way.  How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
244," Naah, me neither ;) I don't care much for that sport - sorry, I'm from Europe, we have different interests I guess... ",Curious to dive deeper
244," Nice talking.  If you find old major league baseball cards, they could be worth millions.  A man found 3 million dollars worth in his grandpa's attic",Surprised
244,I'll start looking right now ;) thank You for the chat,Curious to dive deeper
244,Have a good day!,Happy
245,When I was a kid I used to always collect baseball cards. I heard a man found 3 million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic. Have you ever collected baseball cards?,Curious to dive deeper
245," That's cool.  Sadly, bo I never collected baseball cards.  What about you?",Sad
245," I love baseball so yes, but none are worth any crazy money. Do you watch baseball at all?",Curious to dive deeper
245," Yes, I do watch some games.  I read somewhere that managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams, if the need arises.  How wild is that?",Surprised
245," Yeah baseball does have some weird rules. I think its because the sport is so old. My dads favorite team is the cups and they started in 1876! They also had one of the longest droughts ever, 108 years. What is your favorite team?",Curious to dive deeper
245," My favorite team is the Atlanta Braves and they have been around as long as the Cubs, too.  Both were founded the same year as the Little Bighorn battle.  Wow!",Surprised
245,Both those teams have so much fans. My dad said when the Cubs won in 2016 over 5 million people celebrated in the streets. Have you heard of the cubs curse?,Curious to dive deeper
245," Yeah, it's pretty funny actually. It started in 1945 when stadium security wouldn't let a man named Billy Sianis stay in the stadium with his smelly pet goat. ",Happy
245,The best part about baseball is watching the world series. I remember when the red sox came back and beat the Yankees down 0-3. Its crazy how its been going on since 1903. I wonder how many people actually watch it still.,Curious to dive deeper
245," I think it's still pretty popular.  You know in Japan is so popular, many fans are surprised to discover its status as America's national pastime.",Curious to dive deeper
245,I dunno because my friend told me that the women's world cup had higher television ratings than the world series.,Neutral
245," Worldwide I think Soccer rules.  But, baseball is still pretty popular, too.  I read somewhere that kickball is called soccer baseball in Canada.  That's kind of strange.",Surprised
245,Speaking of strange I heard that the cubs have employed a pitcher with 6 fingers. I do not know why my dad likes that team,Surprised
245," Yeah, they have had pitchers with 4,5, and 6 fingers on their pitching hand. Uncommon, but totally true!",Surprised
245,Another weird thing about the cubs is the last time they won the ottoman empire was still going. Do you really think they were cursed?,Curious to dive deeper
245," I don't know about cursed, probably just bad luck on their part.  ",Neutral
245," They started out so good, they were the first team to win back to back. seems kinda weird maybe baseball is fixed.",Curious to dive deeper
245," I've said that before, myself!  Did you know the great Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 World Series with his team down by one run?",Curious to dive deeper
245," People do not care even if it is fixed, they still wanna watch it. in 2005 a couple scheduled 2430 games!",Surprised
245," Yeah, I heard that they did that for 24 years.  They must be very organized to keep all those schedules straight.",Surprised
245," Baseball is a fun sport, I like seeing it in person live. Have you ever seen baseball in person?",Curious to dive deeper
245," Yes, I have seen many baseball games in my lifetime.  I still love it just as much as I did when I was a kid, playing.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you, I need to get to work.  I'll talk to you later, friend.",Happy
246," The Braves sure are a pupular team, they seem to be well rested for the playoffs",Curious to dive deeper
246,Is that good or bad.  They have had no real good teams to play against.,Neutral
246," I think its a bad thing, practice is everything and not playing enough games can result in lack of chemistry",Curious to dive deeper
246," Thursday at 8:07 am eastern time, the Braves play their first playoff game since 2013.  Many new players going to playoffs for first time.",Neutral
246,They have many young players so its going to be a great experience for them hope that they can make it,Curious to dive deeper
246," As long as they do not forget that runners advance counter clock wise around four bases to score a run, they will be fine.",Neutral
246," Yeah I think they have a great team so as long as they remember the rules everything is going to be ok, the manager can always step in and play with them",Curious to dive deeper
246,I guess thats why the manager dresses like a player.  Is there really a rule that catching a ball in a players hat gives the other team three bases?,Surprised
246," I dont know I haven't seen that, then again I dont watch many of the games, baseball is really popular in Japan so maybe they know if its true over there",Curious to dive deeper
246,Baseball came from Japan.  Makes sense.  The pitcher throws a ball which the opposing team tries to hit with a bat.,Neutral
246,Oh so the game originated in Japan? baseball card collectors can have a hidden fortune and people wouldnt know,Curious to dive deeper
246,The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.  But when do the teams trade cards?  Seems hard to advance around bases and hand out cards.,Happy
246," I dont think they trade cards, well maybe many of them do, a man found 3 million dollars worth of cards in his basements, some can cost a lot",Curious to dive deeper
246," Are baseballs worth anything?  There are 160,000 baseballs used in a major league season.  ",Neutral
246," I guess they are, specially important baseballs from decisive home runs or such, ",Curious to dive deeper
246," I see.  Interesting.  So, for the Simpsons home town of Springfield it is not known what state they are in.  But the Simpsons minor league baseball team is the Isotopes. See what I am getting at?",Neutral
246," Yeah I can follow,  the Isotopes were pretty bad in the Simpsons, I guess reality is not different lol ",Curious to dive deeper
246,That means that the Simpsons are in New Mexico.  You knew that all this time.  Impressive.  Ronald Reagan was a radio broadcaster for the Chicago Cubs in the 1930's.,Neutral
246," He was? that would be interesting to hear lol,their stadium got cursed back in 1945",Curious to dive deeper
246,Reagan must have had an interesting life. The Chicago Cubs used to be the Chicago Orphans.  Weird.  What happens in 1945?,Curious to dive deeper
246," The team got cursed back in 1945, a man named Billy Sianis wasnt allowed in and he cursed the team. The curse worked!!!",Curious to dive deeper
247,do you like the piano?,Curious to dive deeper
247," I love it  is such a classic instrument, and you?",Curious to dive deeper
247,Me too. BBC once played piano tunes all day instead of the news,Curious to dive deeper
247,Yeah because there was no newsworthy news that day,Curious to dive deeper
247,Yeah. Did you know Mercury and McCartney used the same piano to compose their songs?,Curious to dive deeper
247," Yes Bohemian Rhapsody and Hey Jude, respectively",Curious to dive deeper
247,Yeah. Have you heard of circus gallop?,Curious to dive deeper
247,Yes that is the stress testing tune for pianos right?,Curious to dive deeper
247," Yes that one but no human can play it, strange",Curious to dive deeper
247,Yes I know. THere is a piano on top of the tallest mountain in the UK,Curious to dive deeper
247,Yeah and no one still knows how it got there,Curious to dive deeper
247," Yeah strange for sure. The instrument goes back to 1700 though, pretty old",Curious to dive deeper
247,Nice. Do you shop online at all?,Curious to dive deeper
247," Yes all the time, I like Amazon and you?",Curious to dive deeper
247,Me too. Did you know jeff built a clock on a mountain?,Curious to dive deeper
247,Yeah and it is supposed to run for 10 000 years,Curious to dive deeper
247,Yeah. And they named a building after their first customer,Curious to dive deeper
247,Yeah and he spent less than $30,Curious to dive deeper
247,Yeah. Did you know their workers walk up to 15 miles a day?,Curious to dive deeper
247,Yeah I guess they are super busy after all. Did you know they own IMDB,Curious to dive deeper
247,Yeah they seem to be everywhere now really,Curious to dive deeper
247," Indeed, they have become a true giant",Curious to dive deeper
248,Hey there! Happy Friday! Are you a baseball fan at all?,Curious to dive deeper
248," I watch a little, You?",Curious to dive deeper
248,I love baseball. I'm a Yankee fan. Do you root for a team?,Curious to dive deeper
248,I live near Oakland so its the A's for me,Curious to dive deeper
248,Have you ever seen the movie Moneyball?,Curious to dive deeper
248,I saw it a long time ago,Curious to dive deeper
248,Ah I see. It was about Billie Bean managing the A's.,Neutral
248,Yes.  Do you know how many baseballs are used in a season?,Curious to dive deeper
248," I have no idea. I assume a ton. They lose a lot for home runs, foul balls, and then you just see them switch out balls occasionally.",Neutral
248," 160,000 i understand.",Curious to dive deeper
248,Wow. Have you ever caught a ball at a game?,Curious to dive deeper
248,No but we had someone who worked there that we know give us one haha.,Curious to dive deeper
248,I don't think I ever have. Do you remember people going nuts for Barry Bonds homerun balls?,Curious to dive deeper
248," Yeah, people dove into McCovey Cove to get them. Did you know SF radio stations threw shade at Kansas City?",Curious to dive deeper
248,Against the Royals? How come?,Curious to dive deeper
248,They banned the song royals by lorde lol,Surprised
248,Haha really? Did they play in the World Series one year? That must be it.,Happy
248,Yes the world series has been contested 114 times,Curious to dive deeper
248,That's crazy but to be far the World Series was even around when the Ottoman Empire still existed,Neutral
248,Yeah just since 1903,Curious to dive deeper
248,Hey it was great chatting with you. Have a great weekend.,Neutral
248,you too!,Happy
249,Hey! Do you like baseball?,Happy
249,I do.  I love watching the Chicago Cubs in the NL.,Neutral
249,It was so awesome to see them finally win the World Series in 2016.,Neutral
249,Yes that was so exciting!    Especially after a 108 year drought!,Happy
249," Totally! They were the first team to ever win back-to-back World Series, then nothing.",Neutral
249,Yes I do love Wrigley field where they play - its within the city,Neutral
249," Did you know they evidently didn't win for so long because they were ""cursed"" by a man named Billy because Wrigley Field security would let him stay there with his pet goat?",Neutral
249,Yes - who takes a goat to a baseball game?  But 5 million people celebrated in the streets after they finally won!,Happy
249," I would have, too! For one of the oldest teams in the major league? What a day.",Neutral
249,Yes.  The Cubs and Atlanta are the two oldest teams - founded the same year as the battle of little bighourn!,Surprised
249,It's so weird to think that the Cubs is only one of the two baseball teams in Chicago.,Surprised
249," Yes that is pretty funny.  They have always been unique - they have had pitchers with 4, 5, and 6 fingers!",Neutral
249,That's pretty neat. Can you believe the Ottoman empire was still in existence when the Cubs first won the World Series?,Surprised
249,Wow that was a long time ago!   They have appeared in 11 world series total - apparently they were a lot better a hundred years ago!,Surprised
249," I love watching the World Series, though the Women's World Cup had higher ratings.",Neutral
249,Yes the World Series is great fun to watch.  The Fall Classic is always exciting.  I am not sure if I like it better with the playoffs than how it used to be with just the best record which went.,Neutral
249," Baseball is so popular in Japan, they are always surprised to hear it is America's National pasttime.",Neutral
249,Yes.  I think its funny the reason that baseball managers wear a uniform is that they are actually allowed to play!,Surprised
249," Wow! I wonder if the same is true for the Kickball managers, or soccer-baseball in Canada.",Neutral
249,I never realized that there was a couple who scheduled all of the major league games every year - all the way up until 2005!,Surprised
249," Wow, that's gotta be over 2400 games!",Neutral
249,I wish my parents had collected baseball cards.  One lucky guy found 3 million dollars worth of cards of his grandfathers!,Neutral
249,That's so cool!,Neutral
250," Hi, how are you?",Happy
250,Good! Do you like baseball?,Happy
250,I do like it. Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
250," Yes there are interesting facts about baseball, like the number of balls used in a season: 160,000!!",Surprised
250," Wow, that's a lot! The Nationals missed the playoffs last year too!",Curious to dive deeper
250," I looks it was a difficult season for them, they did score but against one of the teams in the bottom, the Marlins",Surprised
250,They had a really great lineup that really underpreformed. It was a shame they couldnt perform under their new manager.,Sad
250," that is tough, they were basically depending on other teams to collapse, the braves and the Phillies",Surprised
250,The Braves over performed and the phillies did too. It would be tough to win that division with those two ahead of you.,Happy
250," Talking about the world series, i found it funny that in 2014 a great song was banned by 2 san francisco radio stations, do you know why?",Happy
250," I do not know, why?",Curious to dive deeper
250," it was the series between SF giants and new orleans Royals, so they banned Royals by Lorde, i think that is a great song",Surprised
250,HA! That's funny. Like watching babe ruth trying to steal a bag...,Happy
250,How is that? Tell me about it!,Curious to dive deeper
250,Babe Ruth was a large man. He was not the fleetest of foot. He was caught stealing to end game 7 of the 1926 world series!,Happy
250," that is funny!! talking about babe ruth there was a pitcher, a female one banned when she struck out Babe ruth and Lou ghering.. kind of unfair! ",Surprised
250,yeah! THat's sexism! Seems like something they would do in the 20s and 30s though...,Disgusted
250," That is true, i think she did something incredible. And about women I was surprised to learn that the world series had a lower rating compared to womens' world cup",Surprised
250,The braves and the cubs are the oldest two teams in MLB. That's crazy!,Surprised
250," that is true, founding members in 1876 with a different name",Happy

251,Pretty well and you? Do you watch baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
251,I have watched baseball from time to time. You?,Curious to dive deeper
251,Yes me too sometimes. Do you know why managers wear uniforms during the game?,Curious to dive deeper
251,I think they can rush on the field at a moment's notice to play a position. Highly unlikely though.,Neutral
251," Yeah, interesting and good for them just in case. Do you know what kickball is called in Canada?",Curious to dive deeper
251,I dunno. Canadian kickball?,Curious to dive deeper
251,It is actually called soccer-baseball,Curious to dive deeper
251,That makes sense. Canadians would find the middle-of-the-road term for the sport. What about the man who found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic? That's pretty cool.,Neutral
251," That is for sure, he made a lot of money there. DO you know who used to do the schedule for the major baseball league games?",Curious to dive deeper
251,I figured the schedule would be done by computer. Who does it?,Curious to dive deeper
251,It was a couple who did it for 24 years straight,Curious to dive deeper
251,Wow. That must have been a pretty sweet job. I wonder how much it paid.,Curious to dive deeper
251,Yeah that is a sweet gig for sure. They scheduled 2430 games a year,Curious to dive deeper
251," That is a lot of games, but maybe year to year it doesn't vary so much. Get it right once and the following years are straightforward.",Neutral
251,True. In Japan baseball is so popular that they cannot believe it is a pastime in the US,Curious to dive deeper
251,I think the Japanese are not aware of many things outside of their country. Until a Japanese person does something important outside of Japan.,Neutral
251,I guess. Did you know the CUbs were the first team to win back to back world series?,Curious to dive deeper
251,The Cubs! How ironic! They struggled for so long to get a Series!,Neutral
251," Yeah, and they have not won ever since",Curious to dive deeper
251," That is a curse if I've ever heard of one. Well, someone needs to hire a gypsy woman to lift the curse.",Neutral
251,I guess. Nice chat,Happy

252," Me too.  I can't believe it's already been 7 seasons since it first premiered on HBO on April 17,2011.",Happy
252," Yeah, the show has a tremendous following and could go on forever. but i think it is better to draw things to a close. especially because of the author.",Neutral
252,Yes.  Did you know that Harry Lloyd is the great great great grandson of Charles Dickens?,Curious to dive deeper
252,Harry Lloyd? who is that ? i have heard of Charles Dickens. he wrote oliver twist.,Neutral

252," Oh, ok. i am bad with names. i usually remember the names of the pretty women. LOL",Neutral
252,LOL  Here's another one...Charlie Chapins granddaughter plays Talisa Maegyr on Game of Thrones.,Happy
252,Whoa. i guess famous people have famous descendants. I guess i am screwed here. LOL Who is your favorite GoT character?,Neutral
252,I would have to say Khal Drogo.  Arya is the fastest rising baby name given to girls in the US...most likely due to Game of Thrones.,Happy
252," That guy is amazing. He played aquaman too. Arya is a good name. short, easy to spell. ",Neutral
252,Yes!  GOT gets financed by Ireland because they film scenes there which boosts tourism incomes.  That makes sense.,Happy
252,I bet it is the same as LOTR and New Zealand. the locals might get tired of tourists though.,Neutral
252,Maybe.  I myself would love it. lol  There is a National Geogrpahic wild show called Game of Lions that follows the lives of lions like GOT characters.  lol,Happy
252," Hm. well, i guess that GoT is a cultural phenomenon. Game of Lions sounds a bit flat though",Neutral
252,Yes!  Do you like horses at all?,Happy
252," Yes, I do like horses, but I have never ridden one. they are majestic but expensive animals. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral

253,Yeah Aladdin is one of my favorites and I am looking forward to the remake. I really enjoyed Robin Williams in the original.,Curious to dive deeper
253,Me too. I miss him making films. I guess he started the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films. What a legend.,Sad
253," Very much a legend. Rest in peace Robin. Celebrities make so much money. For example judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode.",Surprised
253," That's crazy! I don't even watch Judge Judy. Celebs make too much, I think.",Sad
253,Yeah I think we should put our priorities in different things not just celebrities. But some celebrities do good like that celebrity TV chef in Ethiopia who is trying to combat his countries hunger problem.,Happy
253,That's super interesting. Its crazy to think how much celebrities and pop culture influences our lives. There's this show called Game of Thrones that everyone is talking about.,Neutral
253,Oh yeah I love that show. I am so excited for the finale. There is even a National Geographic show that is like Game of Thrones except with lions.,Curious to dive deeper
253,I've never watched the show! What is it about?,Curious to dive deeper
253,It is very complicated but it is set long ago on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos. It is all about attaining power essentially!,Neutral
253," That sounds like something I might want to watch in the future. I've been thinking about naming my future child Arya. Apparently, that's a character in the show! I guess it's the fastest rising baby name.",Surprised
253,Yeah that is a really cool name. That show has done a lot. Ireland actually pays the series so that the film scenes boost tourism for Ireland.,Surprised
253," Interesting. I've always wanted to see Ireland. I guess there are a lot of horses there, and I am interested in seeing them.",Neutral
253,Yes and it is also very green and beautiful. You would definitely like the Show Game of Thrones because there are a lot of horses in the show.,Curious to dive deeper
253,I'll have to check it out sometime. Are you interested in horses as well?,Curious to dive deeper
253,Yeah I have rode horses quite a bit. They are very unique and loving animals. However I never rode a horse to school like those two high school students who got suspended that one time.,Curious to dive deeper
253," I have heard about that. Did you know that Clint Eastwood is allergic to horses, even though he has been on horseback for many of his movies?",Curious to dive deeper
253,That must've made work a bit harder! Have you ever ridden a horse with a fifth speed like the Icelandic horses have? It is called Tolt.,Curious to dive deeper
253," I have not. I've ridden Lipizzaner horses, though. They're known for their classical dressage performances.",Neutral
253,Very cool. Apparently they are born black or brown and take about six years to turn completely white. It was nice chatting with you see you later.,Surprised
254,I saw an article that says pixar studio has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities,Surprised
254," That's funny, considering the number of stars in their films, following in Robin Williams footsteps!",Surprised
254,Robin Williams in aladdin was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films,Surprised

254,That is quite a bit different than American fantasy drama series Game of Thrones!,Surprised
254,ethiopia has a celebrity tv chef who believes he can combat his country's hunger problems by encouraging everyone to eat more diverse foods,Surprised
254," Perhaps he could join the cast of Game of Thrones, since they film in Croatia, Malta and all over the world!",Neutral
254,I just saw that Charlie Chaplins granddaughter plays talisa maegry in game of thrones,Surprised
254," Interesting.     Harry Lloyd is also a famous descendant, the great-great-great grandson of charles dickens.",Surprised
254,some famous people.  did you know that there is a Nat Geo wild show called games of lions that follows the lives of lions like the game of thrones characters,Surprised
254,Wow.     I wonder if Ireland helps finance that like they do the actual show!,Surprised
254,Good question.  I saw that Arya is the fastest rising new baby name given to girls in the US most likely due to game of thrones,Surprised
254," People like celebrities, real and fictional - almost as much as horses or Equus Ferus!",Surprised
254," Icelandic horses have a fifth speed, tolt, that is basically speedwalking for a horse",Surprised
254,I wonder when that started in the 45 to 55 million evolution of the species!,Happy
254,not sure about that.  Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 bc,Curious to dive deeper
254," Interesting, so the entire process of getting them used to humans took 1000 years or so.",Curious to dive deeper
254,it says that domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC,Surprised
254," Interesting, although there are still some wild horses in nature.",Surprised

260," Wow, not surprising. Maryland used to have a law like that. ",Curious to dive deeper

260," Yeah, very true. The chicago cubs were the first team to win back to back world series. Pretty amazing. ",Curious to dive deeper
261,hey there what do you think of the game of baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
261,Baseball is ok. I remember hearing my older relatives calling the World Series the Fall Classic. It sounds very retro.,Happy
261," haha that is retro, I never knew that baseball managers could start playing if they wanted to, and thats why they wear uniforms",Surprised
261," Yes I just recently learned that, too, and thought it was very interesting! It might be like an embarrassment to the team to have to bring in a manager like that, though. What do you think?",Curious to dive deeper
261," haha ya I would think so, can you believe that baseball is super popular in Japan, I had no idea",Surprised
261," Yea, when I worked for Target a few years ago I remember they'd have Japanese baseball on in the break room along with other TV's with American Sports.",Neutral
261," ah that is interesting, I wish I was like the guy who found millions of dollars of baseball cards in his attic, now that would be a surprise",Surprised

261," wow that sounds delicious right now, do you ever shop at Target btw?",Curious to dive deeper
261," I like Target better than Walmart, although I don't know about the corporations as a whole and how they do business. I hear more about Walmart being unfair...don't really ever hear that about Target but who knows, I guess...",Curious to dive deeper
261," ya I don't really know, I do go to target and apparently Vermont is the only state that doesn't have a Target in it",Surprised
261," That's very interesting. I wonder why Target isn't in Vermont, yet. Also, I wonder if Walmart is in Vermont, now? Maybe they have Bi Mart...although it's not very upscale for Vermont!",Curious to dive deeper
261,haha that'd be funny to see! what is screwy is a state senator actually works at target in order to make enough money to get by,Surprised
261,I heard recently that eighty percent of the supplements sold in places like Target contain NONE of the advertised herbs in them. We really need a better rules system.,Surprised
261," wow ya I agree, that's really messed up, at least Target doesn't carry tobacco products that is good",Surprised
261,Very true! I wasn't aware until recently that Target was originally named Good fellow Dry Goods! Now THAT is retro! hahah,Curious to dive deeper
261,haha definitely an improvement! pretty crazy that it has been around since 1902 and was founded in Minneapolis!,Surprised

263," How's it going, have you seen the 2018 release of Black Panther?",Curious to dive deeper
263," No I haven't but I understand there is some parallel being drawn between it and ""The Wiz""",Curious to dive deeper
263," I'm not to familiar with the Wiz, is that based on the Wizard of Oz?",Curious to dive deeper
263," Yes, it has much different music (e.g., funk and disco).  The movie had Michael Jackson.  It doesn't have the song ""Be a Lion.""",Curious to dive deeper
263," I've heard the Wiz as being described as weird, from the description I tend to agree",Neutral
263," It is kind of weird... The music and the dancing are at the core.  You might remember the song ""Ease on Down the Road.""",Curious to dive deeper
263," Maybe but not that I think of it the normal Wizard of Oz is weird, like really weird so I guess the Wiz should be weird too",Neutral
263," There is a big cultural difference between the two, like a farm in KS vs. Detroit.  Funny, it is at the Ford Theater in D.C.  ",Curious to dive deeper
263," Ford Theater, isn't that were Lincoln was assassinated?",Curious to dive deeper
263,Yep.  I didn't realize it was still a theater.  I would have imagined it as a museum.  The tickets are $20-$73.,Curious to dive deeper
263," I guess $20-$73 for tickets isn't a bad price, if the Wiz is performed near me maybe I'll check it out",Neutral
263,I may see the Black Panther.  I guess he is the richest of all superheros with $500B.  Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne aren't even close.,Curious to dive deeper
263," Nope, I hear Chadwick Boseman did a great job as T'Challa, he was great in Civil War",Neutral
263,I don't even remember it being a comic book.  I wonder if people confused it with the radical civil rights group under the same name?,Curious to dive deeper
263,I used to think Black Panther was named after the group but I guess the comic came out before the group,Surprised
263," Interesting.  Now I'm wondering it the civil rights group got their name from the comic?  They changed the name to ""Black Leopard"" -- doesn't sound as cool.",Surprised
263," Nope, black leopard sounds kinda lame",Neutral
263,I didn't realize Siri was intended for Android until Apple bought it inn 2010.,Surprised
263," Me neither. I personally find Siri creepy, especially when it sings the same song as hal 9000",Fearful
263,Yikes!  Hal creeps me out.  It's like picturing Tupac as a ballet dancer.  I guess he did that in high school. I can't see that...,Fearful
263," Well I got to go, nice chatting with you",Neutral
264," Did you ever think about how celebrities in science are rarer than in music, film, sport, and politics?",Surprised
264,No I never thought of that.  Were you a fan of Stephen Hawking?,Curious to dive deeper
264,I think that it was amazing how he was almost completely paralyzed and could accomplish so much.,Happy
264," Yes, I agree, he was brilliant as well.  He was the ultimate example of mind over matter. ",Curious to dive deeper
264," He was one of the first people to apply quantum physics to black holes and make predictions  with a process named after him as ""Hawking radiation""",Curious to dive deeper
264,Yeah his understanding and explaining of quantum physics and other matter is incredible.,Curious to dive deeper
264," I don't really understand what he understood because it seems so foreign to me, but he also had a lot of wit as well to share with the world.",Happy
264," Yeah I am the same, it is very complex stuff. There are scientists who theorize that universes evolve through natural selection like species do here. ",Curious to dive deeper
264,Hawking was very active up until the end of life even travelling and lecturing internationally.  I have to give credit as well to his supporters,Curious to dive deeper
264,Yeah I agree with you there.  I guess there is a radical theory that there is only one electron in the universe! I'm sure Hawking would have disagreed.,Curious to dive deeper
264," Probably.  Also, there is a region of space maybe pulling galaxies outside the observable universe.  There must be so much out there.",Surprised
264," Wow, yeah it is wild to think about the universe as a whole in general. ",Surprised
264,Strange but there are some stars that are cold enough that they can be touched by a human hand,Surprised
264," That is a strange fact, very cool.  Did you know that Kim jong-un has a degree in physics?",Curious to dive deeper
264," Not sure who that is, but I wonder if Hawkings would validate the tidbit that the universe could have come from nothing without violating physics?",Curious to dive deeper
264,I'm not sure that is an interesting thought and he is the leader of North Korea.,Curious to dive deeper
264,Oh wow!  Robin Williams in aladdin was the first actor to start the trend of celebrity voicings of animated film characters.,Curious to dive deeper
264,I didn't know that.  I guess Pixas spent 3 years studying the physics of curly hair in order to get merida's hair in brave right.,Curious to dive deeper
264," People don't realize how much time is spent on these details.  Judge Judy makes a heap of money at $123,000 per episode  being highest paid celebrity behind Lebron James",Surprised
264,Holy cow that is so much an episode.  I wonder how much other tv people make.,Curious to dive deeper
264," I don't know, but I guess not as much.  Carol Burnett was the first celebrity on Sesame Street :)",Surprised
265,Do you know who Stephen Hawking is?,Curious to dive deeper
265," Hello,  yes I do.  I actually just recently watched a movie about him as well.  The Theory Of Everything,  very well done and explained a lot about his life. ",Curious to dive deeper
265," Interesting, I've seen that one too. Did you know a lot of his work is around blackholes? ",Curious to dive deeper
265,Yes.  Did you know that the deepest note in the universe is emitted by a black hole!,Curious to dive deeper
265,It wouldn't surprise me. I think a lot of his work was around the Event Horizon's if I remember correctly.,Curious to dive deeper
265,If you fold a paper in half 103 times it would be as thick as the observable universe!,Curious to dive deeper
265,Somehow I don't believe that.,Curious to dive deeper
265," Ok.  Thats cool.  I have no idea if thats true,  something I read recently in some cool facts.  This is no where near my area of expertise.  I did read that there may be a universe inside the black hole though,  isn't that crazy!",Curious to dive deeper
265," Yeah, they have a lot of wacky ideas about the universe. That much I do know. They also propose it is a hologram. ",Curious to dive deeper
265,I also read that the universe used to be opaque due to there being too much plasma that light could not travel through it.,Curious to dive deeper
265," Yeah, I've read that as well. There are stars in the universe that are cold enough to be touched by humans. ",Curious to dive deeper
265," Thats really cool.  I can't imagine touching a star.  Have you ever heard of a hubble telescope?  Apparently it discovered a galaxy so big it shouldn't exist,  according to physics. ",Curious to dive deeper
265," Yeah, that is pretty cool. I know a lot about Hubble, it is a pretty cool telescope. ",Curious to dive deeper
265,Sounds like it!,Curious to dive deeper
265," Yeah, I remember when they did the space walk to fix it, remember that? ",Curious to dive deeper
265,I do not.  Was that recently?,Curious to dive deeper
265," It was about 15 years ago, apparently the hubble is having problems again. ",Curious to dive deeper
265,I see.  Guess they really need to make some upgrades.  A lot in technology has changed in  years,Curious to dive deeper
265," Yeah, it does. Pretty bad, the hubble can see a lot of things. ",Curious to dive deeper
265,Did you know turbulence is one of physics great mysteries?,Curious to dive deeper
265," I did, but they sort of have it figured out. I hate turbulence. Nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
266," Hi, how are you?",Neutral
266," Good, how are you? Celebrities in science are quite rare aren't they? I was a fan of Stephen Hawking. I'm sad he finally passed away from ALS.",Sad
266," He was tremendous thinker. Gosh, I wonder if he was as smart as Kim Jong-un, who has a degree in physics, supposedly. ",Neutral
266,I would think that he is smarter. I wonder how it felt to have such a physical disability but yet such a sharp mind.,Sad
266," In his younger years, he wasn't badly afflicted. I wonder whether he was one of the  scientists who theorize that universes evolve through natural selection",Curious to dive deeper
266," Hmm, it wouldn't surprise me. Hawking went further than Einstein did on understanding of gravity. Hawking developed new graphical methods that let him visualize physics of light paths in warped space, black holes, and the convulsions of the universe.",Surprised
266,And he did all that while battling ALS. There is a theory that there is only one electron in the universe. Does this make any sense? I wonder who came up with that.,Surprised
266," Hmm, it does not to me but I know I'm not much of a scientific mind. Hawking strengthened the Big Bang theory as well that says that the galaxies were in a compressed area smaller than a single atom before the big bang.",Curious to dive deeper
266," Hard to imagine, but I guess the mathematics supports it. The universe could have come from nothing without violating physics. Particles can pop in and out of existence, so I guess a universe worth could as well.",Neutral
266," Yeah, it's hard for me to relate to scientists and all of their elaborate theories but Hawking was blessed with wit. He was quite the jokester, which makes him very relatable.",Happy
266,I think he took to his celebrity status quite well. Pixar studio has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities. I wonder if Hawking ever got a chance to see it.,Curious to dive deeper
266," Speaking of celebrities, did you know that Judge Judy is the highest paid celebrity after lebron james?",Curious to dive deeper
266,The woman is a legend. Over $100k per episode. Probably a longer career too. But she probably hasn't done any animated voice work.,Neutral
266,I guess celebrities doing voice work is a fairly new thing in terms of history. Robin Williams was the first to start the trend of celebrities doing animated film voices. This was for the movie Aladdin.,Surprised
266,Did he ever appear on Sesame Street? Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on the children's series. He would have been great on that show!,Neutral
266,That is a good question! Do you like celebrity chefs?,Curious to dive deeper
266,Not especially. I think it's more about them than the food. You?,Neutral
266," Yeah, not really. It's cool that a celebrity chef from Ethiopia is using his fame for good. He believes he can combat his country's hunger problems",Curious to dive deeper
266," I think he'll have a positive impact. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting with you.",Neutral
266," Yes, it has been fun. This talk of food has made me hungry though!",Happy
266,Have a good day!,Happy
267,How's it going? Did you know that the Universe could be just a giant holgram?,Curious to dive deeper
267," Hi, Wow that is a hard concept to digest! Did you know it may be possible to touch a star?",Happy
267," No I had no idea, that would be awesome though as long as the star isn't too cold",Neutral
267,They have confirmed there are cold stars and can be touch by our hands,Happy
267,That's pretty cool. I wonder if it has anything to do with the region of space that may be pulling galaxies outside the observable universe,Curious to dive deeper
267," Wow the universe is so marvelous and complex, there are many theories, for example that there is only one electron in the universe!",Happy
267," That would be insane if there is only one electron in the universe, it would mean I wasted a lot of time in chemistry class",Surprised
267," That is a crazy theory! I totally agree. It is good there has been curious people like the Greeks, Copernicus, Newton.  Not always right but opened the way for research!",Happy
267," Yea, it's interesting that the Universe may have evolved through natural selection like the species on earth",Neutral
267,All this has to do with Physics... did you know Pixar studied the physics of curly har for 3 years?,Happy
267," No, that's pretty crazy, I wonder if they asked Kim Jong-un to help since he has a degree in physics",Neutral
267," hahahaha It was for Maida's hair in ""Brave"" very different hair from Kim's... but maybe he helped with some knowledge ",Happy
267,Maybe Kim could explain how the universe was able to come from nothing without violating the rules of physics,Neutral
267," hahaha that would not be easy! Talking about Pixar, did you ever hear about their secret room?",Happy
267," Yea, I heard Pixar let's celebrities visit it",Neutral
267," I saw it in the extras of Toy Story, its cool! do you know about the highest paid celebrities?",Happy
267," A little, I know Jude Judy is the highest paid before Lebron James",Neutral
267,wow that is crazy!! how much does she make?,Surprised
267," Jude Judy is paid 123,000 an episode for her show",Neutral
267,Wow that is a lot! Do you know Rbin williams was a pioneer in voicing characters for animation movies?,Happy
267," Yes in Aladdin. Well I have to go, nice chatting with you",Neutral
268,Do you like to dance?,Curious to dive deeper
268," Hello, no I do not , do you?",Curious to dive deeper
268,I do when I have a few drinks in me lol. I turned into a michael jackson type dancer,Curious to dive deeper
268," That's funny, I have never been much into it. I can do a few Fortnite dances because my kids force me to.",Curious to dive deeper
268," lol all kids know how to do that, they are hilarious! Michael Jackson has a patent from that lean he does",Curious to dive deeper
268," I believe that, music is such a strong persuader.",Curious to dive deeper
268," for sure, I love music. Babies do too. Did you kids as baby dance a lot?",Curious to dive deeper
268," My son use to bob his head a lot to music when he was a baby, so I believe it!",Happy
268," I believe it too, I am watching my 10 month old right now shake her little behind to some music while standing up ha",Curious to dive deeper
268,Did you see the black panther movie?,Curious to dive deeper
268," Yep, it was a great movie. A lot of people watched it, I think it made a billion or more at the box office, did you?",Curious to dive deeper
268,I cant believe Disney now owns all of Marvel!,Curious to dive deeper
268," Right, talk about a great investment! Black Panther is the richest of all superheroes",Curious to dive deeper
268,Really I would have thought Tony Stark would have been!,Curious to dive deeper
268," Me too, or Batman! I think Black Panther is worth 500 billion dollars!",Curious to dive deeper
268,That's crazy I wonder if he would use Siri? Im sure he uses a virtual assistant somewhere in that fortress of technology.,Curious to dive deeper
268," right lol. I have siri but never utilize that technology much, do you?",Curious to dive deeper
268,I use it only to make my grocery list! What voice do you use for yours?,Happy
268," That is a great idea, I just use the default one, the original I think. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
268," I recently switched from the Australian voice to the U.K version, gotta keep my women interesting fresh!",Curious to dive deeper
268," I will have to check that out lol! It was so nice chatting with you, enjoy your weekend!",Curious to dive deeper
269,Do you enjoy baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
269,Yes.  Just haven't followed it in the past few years.,Neutral
269," Me neither I just like to watch the World Series from time to time, its a sport with a lot of history. ",Curious to dive deeper
269," Find it funny that the isotopes, a minor league, was named after a team on the simpsons",Surprised
269," That is funny, I used to love them in The Simpsons do you like the Yankees? that is one of the most popular teams. ",Curious to dive deeper
269,I'm a Phillies person.  I like that the Yankees uniforms doesn't have the players names on their back.  Interesting concept.,Curious to dive deeper
269," It is an interesting concept, did you hear about the pitchers that swapped families permanently ?",Curious to dive deeper
269,How can you swap families?  Didn't hear that.,Curious to dive deeper
269," Yeah that happened back in 1973, and I dont know how that can work seems like both families are nuts",Curious to dive deeper
269,LOL  Must be!  How about that 17 year old female striking out babe ruth and lou gehrig.  Wonder what ever happened to her?,Curious to dive deeper
269," She did? woah, maybe she was hired to play in the league lol , Ruth and Gehrig must had felt terrible specially because of all the sexism of the time ",Curious to dive deeper
269,For sure!!  I never knew a team receives 3 bases if an opposing team player catches a ball in their hat!!,Surprised
269," I didnt know about that rule, maybe it happens often, do you know the team Chicago Cubs? ",Curious to dive deeper
269,Yes.  They're the team that only won the series twice and those wins were back to back.,Happy
269," Yeah they havent won the series since then, I guess the team is cursed.",Curious to dive deeper
269,Cursed for being greedy  lol!!  Your Yankees have the second highest attendance record!,Happy
269,I guess that was the price they had to pay and really? the second one? I thought they were first,Surprised
269,I might have misread that.  2011 they were second highest.  Anyway  it was nice chatting with you!!,Neutral
269," Oh so that was back in 2011 that makes more sense, and it was great chatting I agree have a nice day bye",Curious to dive deeper
269,Yes thank you,Neutral
269,Ok bye again lol,Curious to dive deeper
270," I am guessing long ball is really working for the Dodgers, what do you think?",Surprised
270," Yeah it really worked for them this season, just didn't have enough in the world series. ",Neutral
270,Who do you think will win out of the top ten?,Curious to dive deeper
270,For next season?  Well I think the Yankees will have a better season.,Curious to dive deeper
270," Yes, they seem good.  I also was happy to see the Brewers finally rising to the challenge.",Happy
270," Hey now your talking, the Brewers are my favorite team.  I was upset when they lost game 7 to the dodgers. ",Curious to dive deeper
270,I used to live in Wisconsin so still happy when they win.  LA team looks pretty good too.,Happy
270," Nice! Yeah LA has been really good the last few seasons, I think they will have another good one next year. ",Curious to dive deeper
270,Do you think next year will favor slugging hitters again?,Curious to dive deeper
270," I think it will.  I think there will be even more home runs next year, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
270,I think so as well.,Happy
270,Did you watch much of the world series this year?,Curious to dive deeper
270," No, I missed it, I work odd hours.",Sad
270,Yeah after the Brewers lost I didn't have too much interest.,Neutral
270," Wow, I just read that in 1973 two yankees pitchers swapped families permanently, is that crazy or what?",Surprised
270," That is wild!  I know Babe Ruth was a famous Yankee, did you ever see the movie the pride of the yankees?",Curious to dive deeper
270," I have not, to be honest I'm not a sports fan. ",Neutral
270," I watched it recently it was pretty good, Babe Ruth played himself in the movie, a good Yankee movie. ",Curious to dive deeper
270,That is interesting!  Did you see they suspended Don Mattingly because he refused to get a haircut?  I can't imagine that happening these days.,Happy
270," Yeah, I remember the Simpsons doing a parody of that one time as well. ",Neutral
270,Now you're talking!  Love the Simpsons!,Happy
270," Oh yeah, the softball episode is my favorite of all time, Daryl Strawberry was in it, he was a former Yankee right?",Curious to dive deeper
270,Do you remember which season? I'll have to catch that.,Happy
270," I think it was season 3 or 4 maybe, but I think the best ever. ",Neutral
271,I love this time of year. Baseball opening day is just around the corner.  Are you a fan?,Happy
271," I have been to a few games, mostly New York Yankee games in the Bronx.",Happy
271,Well they Yankees are the most successful team of all time.  By far the most World Series wins.,Curious to dive deeper
271,Bobby Richard on the Yankees was the only person to win a World Series MVP despite losing the series.,Surprised
271,I can imagine that was bittersweet for him then.  Did you go to old Yankee Stadium or the new one that opened in 2009?,Curious to dive deeper
271,I have been to both stadiums. I suppose I am one of the numbers that support the Yankees having the second highest attendance.,Happy
271,Are you a Mets fan too?  I know they are not as popular as the Yankees but they have a big following too,Curious to dive deeper
271,I am definitely a bigger fan of the Mets. I like underdog stories. I never knew in 1974 they shared Shea Stadium with the Mets.,Surprised
271,I think the Jets and Giants played at Shea at some point to.  Lots of work for the groundskeepers,Curious to dive deeper
271,I bet. It was around the same time in 1973 that two Yankee pitchers swapped families permanently. How unusual.,Surprised
271,Probably the strangest baseball trade in MLB history.,Happy
271,Haha that is very good. Speaking of strange the Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time the Chicago cubs won the world series.,Surprised
271,The Ottoman empire was in existence in 2016?  That does not seem accurate.,Curious to dive deeper
271," I think it was the World Series won before 2016. Because according the the facts the Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win back to back world series and haven't won since, with exception to 2016.",Curious to dive deeper
271,I have to respect Cubs fans for sticking with the team for 100 years of losing,Curious to dive deeper
271,Baseball is all about tradition. That is probably why a married couple scheduled all 2430 major league games up until 2005.,Surprised
271,Can you imagine the planning and cost that would go into that?,Curious to dive deeper
271,They were great at managing it. I never heard of any mistakes. Speaking of managers. Baseball managers wear uniforms because they are techincally able to play.,Surprised
271,Interesting.  Also baseball is just as popular in Japan if not more so.,Surprised
271,That is interesting. It is so popular they are surprised to find it is actually America's national pastime.,Surprised
271,A lot of Japanese players have gone on to have great careers in the MLB.  Ichiro is one of the best hitters of all time.,Happy
272,Do you like baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
272,Sure. baseball is intersting. i try to watch the world series. you?,Neutral
272," Me too, interesting how the cubs were the first team to win them back to back and then had really bad luck some would say the team was cursed",Curious to dive deeper
272,I think that they suffer a curse. what can they do to lift the curse? is there a spell to cast? A sacrifice to make?,Neutral
272," I dont know, thats an interesting question maybe sacrifice a goat and call it a day? do you like the Yankees?",Curious to dive deeper
272,I am not a yankees fan. could we sacrifice another goat against the yankees?,Neutral
272," Sounds like a solid plan, you get the goat lol",Curious to dive deeper
272,I figure that there must be something that can both lift the cubs curse and transport it to the yankees. Who has the most world series thus far?,Neutral
272," I have no idea, I would have to say the Yankees, ",Curious to dive deeper
272," Yes, i think the Yankees have the most. Is this the result of voodoo and witchcraft? if so, then it can be undone through voodoo. ",Neutral
272," I have no idea about magic, maybe Bobby Richardson is also cursed, he is the only person to win the MVP award and the lose the series",Curious to dive deeper
272,that is a shame. The new york yankees suspended don mattingly because he refused to get a haircut. Does that seem fair?,Neutral
272," No, it does not seem fair at all, there is also a Lost  Yankees player",Curious to dive deeper
272,Lost? How did they lose him? that sounds almost intentional. What about bill oreilly? he has been pretty sneaky too.,Neutral
272," I have no idea, I think it means a player in the Lost series, and what about him? what did old Bill do this time",Curious to dive deeper
272," Oh, he pretended to be a member of the press while he was in college in order to get season tickets. ",Neutral
272," Oh I heard about that, thats so funny, best part is that it worked, he fooled many and got to watch the games for free",Curious to dive deeper
272," ol Bill is a cunning one. you gotta keep a close eye on him. maybe if he had worn a uniform, he could pretend to be a manager.",Neutral
272," He could just to get season tickets I know I would, he sure pulled a fast one on many",Curious to dive deeper
272," I guess i was never tempted to get season tickets, but if I were, i would probably stray into the chicanery that bill committed. his sin is the sin that i would commit, were i in his shoes. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
272," I guess we are different that way lol, I would follow Bills footsteps and get me free tickets and I agree its been a great and fun chat thank you very much, bye. ",Curious to dive deeper
273," Hi, do you like baseball?",Curious to dive deeper
273,I do like baseball. dont get much chance to watch. usually watch the WS. you?,Neutral
273,I love baseball as well. Did you know managers can technically play which is the reason they wear uniforms?,Happy
273," I bet that is from the old days. I bet in the old days, one of the players was chosen to be manager.",Neutral
273,Haha that would be funny to see. Kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada.,Surprised
273,What? Why? is kickball not clear enough? boy those canadians need to have a word for everything LOL,Neutral
273,LOL I agree. A man once found $3 million dollars worth in baseball cards.,Surprised
273," that is a terrific find. i would probably sell a few, but keep the rest as an investment. what about you?",Neutral
273," I agree, I would definitely sell the rest so I could retire early lol.",Neutral
273," Yeah, that's true. buy stock and live off the dividends. did you watch the world series last year?",Neutral
273,I didn't get to watch it. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
273,I watched a few games. the dodgers lost again. they really have trouble in the series.,Neutral
273,I'm a huge Cincinnati Reds fan. Just hoping I can see a World Series one day. Who do you like?,Curious to dive deeper
273,i like the bay area teams. they havent done very well recently. the giants were good a few years back.,Neutral
273,That's cool. Did you know Babe Ruth was caught stealing in game 7 in the 1926 World Series?,Surprised
273," the babe didnt look like much of a runner. he could hit, but run? im surprised he tried to steal.",Neutral
273,Haha I agree. The Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time the Cubs won the World Series which is just crazy.,Surprised
273,that is amazing. the cubs are in the history books. they are history. not much has happened to change their place in the history books,Neutral
273,I agree. Do you like the Yankees?,Curious to dive deeper
273,Not particularly. they always have a ton of money and can buy the best players. it is hard on the small market teams.,Neutral
273," For sure. Well, it was good talking to you. Have a good day. ",Happy
274,Are you a fan of baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
274,I will watch it if it is on but I don't follow many teams. Do you know a lot about it?,Curious to dive deeper
274,Not a lot but a little. Did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically eligible to play if they need to?,Curious to dive deeper
274,I wouldn't have guessed that. I always thought of the managers as those out of shape guys who yelled at the players.,Surprised
274,Me too. Did you know that baseball is hugely popular in Japan?,Curious to dive deeper
274,That I did know. They have some great teams over there. I think they were surprised at how popular it is in america as well.,Neutral
274,Yes they are which is so strange to me. Did you hear about the guy who found baseball cards in his grandfather's attic?,Curious to dive deeper
274,Weren't they worth a few million dollars? Could you imagine finding something like that!?,Curious to dive deeper
274,Yes they were. 3 million to be exact. That would be amazing!,Happy
274,I wonder if there were a lot of Yankee cards in there. They seem to be the powerhouse team of baseball.,Curious to dive deeper
274," They do. Speaking of, in 1973 two Yankees pitchers swapped families permanently! ",Surprised
274,Um how would that even work? Like they married each others wives and raised the others kids? So strange!,Surprised
274,I guess. I have no idea why they would do that. Bill O'Reilly made up a fake press organization to get Yankee's season tickets while he was in college.,Neutral
274,Given the price of yankee tickets that is one way to get in I guess. I wonder if that started his love of news as a career.,Curious to dive deeper
274,That's a good question but I also can't believe it worked. Did you know that until their recent win the last time the Cubs won a World Series the Ottoman Empire still existed?!,Surprised
274,Makes sense. I might not know a ton about baseball but i know that the cubs  are always the underdogs.,Sad
274,Definitely. They were also the first team to win back-to-back world series but then they never won again until the recent win.,Neutral
274,You have to wonder why when teams like the yankees win all the time. Is it the money in the team or lack of players? very strange.,Curious to dive deeper
274,There is no salary cap in baseball and they have all of the money. They should cap it like the NFL does.,Neutral
274,That would be a good thing. I think it would increase the excitement of the game because you would have more evenly matched teams.,Disgusted
274,I agree. They've been among the leaders in attendance since 2011 and you know that's because they always win. I think that would level that out as well.,Neutral
275,Are you a fan of baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
275,I sometimes follow baseball. usually around the world series. you?,Neutral
275," Yeah, usually when my home team is doing good. ",Curious to dive deeper
275,i find the game to be too slow most of the time. I would prefer to watch the highlights and get the gist.,Neutral
275," Yeah, they are better to attend in person. Or I should say they used to be better until they jacked the price of a beer up to $12. ",Curious to dive deeper
275," I do not buy anything at games. i get loaded up before and then partake after. during the game, no.",Neutral
275,That's probably a good idea. Did you know somebody found $3 mill of baseball cards in their attic?,Curious to dive deeper
275," I would love to make such a find. i would sell some of the cards, and keep the rest as an investment.",Neutral
275," Yeah, me too. They must have been very old cards. ",Curious to dive deeper
275,I think they were from before 1900. classics. very rare. collectors were probably pretty excited.,Neutral
275," WOW, I wonder if the Honus Wagner card is still the most valuable. ",Curious to dive deeper
275," It probably is. i have no idea what its value is, but it has to be one of the most.",Neutral
275," Yeah, it is the most valuable card ever. ",Curious to dive deeper
275,That is what i heard. i know that cards came with packs of cigarettes. that has changed! LOL,Neutral
275,Hilarious! I wonder what it is worth these days?,Curious to dive deeper
275,i have no idea. millions? you got me. some tech billionaire will want the thing and pay a ton.,Neutral
275," Yeah, that is probably true. Did you know kickball in canada is called soccer baseball? ",Curious to dive deeper
275," That is a cutesy name. i wonder why they chose that. kickball is better, i think.",Neutral
275," Yeah, I'm not sure, but it seems hilarious. Well, nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
275,I enjoyed chatting with you!,Neutral
275,Take it easy!,Happy
276," Hello, are you a baseball fan?",Curious to dive deeper
276," I do not know much about baseball but I have been to a bunch of games, including a few Yankee games. It does have the second highest attendance.",Happy
276,Baseball games are fun to go to but they take a long time. I usually end up walking around the concourse for a couple innings.,Happy
276,I never knew why baseball managers wore uniforms. I thought it was just to blend in with the team and support the team. Ends up they are able to play if the need arises.,Surprised
276,Looking at some of the managers today I think it's more of a tradition now. I know in the past there were a few times where there were actual player/coaches. I believe Ted Williams was one.,Surprised
276,I found it very surprising that a married couple had been scheduling all 2430 major league baseball games up until 2005. I figured it was just a computer.,Surprised
276,Baseball is deep into it's tradition. They probably didn't worry about any form of software until it became too complicated.,Curious to dive deeper
276," You're right. That's probably why baseball cards are so popular too, tradition. A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in his grandfathers attic.",Surprised
276," Also the market was not as saturated back then as it is today, now so many different companies make cards that there isn't a chance for them to be as rare.",Neutral
276,I never knew that is why the old ones are so valuable. I thought it was simply the popularity of the player. In Japan baseball is so popular fans do not realize it is actually America's pastime. I wonder what their baseball cards go for.,Curious to dive deeper
276,It's interesting when a Japanese player wants to play in the MLB. The team gets money for that player leaving.,Neutral
276,I did not know that. In Canada kickball is called soccer-baseball. Odd how a different country views baseball.,Surprised
276,I wonder if they have any different rules than we do? It would be interesting to see if they put their own twist on the game.,Curious to dive deeper
276," When I think of baseball, I think of countries like Japan and America. I don't really think of Canada and I especially do not think of the Ottoman Empire which were still in existence the last time the Chicago Cubs won the world series.",Surprised
276," It's also very popular in Latin America. A lot of professional players are from Cuba, Puerto Rico, The Dominican Republic, and Venezuela.",Neutral
276,That is true. I suppose Canada does have influence because in the 1992 world series the US Marine Corps color guard brought in the Canadian flag upside down.,Surprised
276,That must have been embarrassing. Hopefully everyone realized it was a mistake!,Curious to dive deeper
276,Well if Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 world series with his team down by one run and everyone still loves him then I am sure it is okay about the flag all those years later.,Surprised
276,I'm sure it is since I've never heard it brought up until now.,Neutral
276,Well thanks so much for chatting to me about baseball. I learned a lot today.,Happy
276," Thanks, it was fun chatting with you as well!",Happy
277,Hello are you a fan of baseball,Neutral
277,Hello! I like the New York yankee's! how about you?,Happy
277,Not really a fan of baseball personally,Neutral
277,I don't follow it but I like Baseball! The world series is always exciting! The New York Yankees have a lost player....never found! How odd.,Happy
277,That is odd... a man once found some 1900s baseball cards in his granfathers attic and they where worth 3 million bucks,Neutral
277," Wow, lucky! Did you know kickball is considered a type of baseball in Canada? Interesting! ",Surprised
277,That is interesting! Baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans are suprised to know it is considered Americas national pastime,Neutral
277," That's funny, it has always been America's favorite pastime! I wonder if they take Baseball as serious as American's do lol, or if they watch the world series as well.",Happy
277,I have no clue... so you are a yankees fan,Neutral
277," Yes, they are a very interesting team. Way back in 73 2 of the Yankees pitchers swapped families, permanently, pretty odd.",Surprised
277,That is odd.. Bobby Richardson is the only person to win a world series mvp despite losing the series.. I know the Yankees are pretty well known bbut not to much else about baseball,Neutral
277," Yeah, I don't know many Baseball teams. I do like the world series because it is pretty exciting to watch. Long ago, the women's world cup had higher tv ratings than the world series though.",Happy
277,That is pretty crazy.. my daughter plays softball so that is interesting to know... the chicago cubs where the first baseball team to win back to back world series and havent won since lol my step dad is a cubs fan,Neutral
277," I love softball, I played on a league for a couple of years. So yep I can appreciate baseball because it is much tougher to play. The Cubs, I really don't follow them but I do love our home team too even if they are not so great lol..",Happy
277,yeah i dont really pay attention to baseball this is the first year I have somewhat paid attention to football I went to a Cheifs game and it was a pretty awesome experience,Neutral
277," Cool! I haven't been to a Football game before, but have been to a baseball and a basketball and I think it was all pretty fun.",Happy
277,Yeah it is exciting thats for sure,Neutral
277,It really was. Do you know what the Ottoman Empire is? I guess it was still in existence when the cubs last won the World series....not sure what that is though.....,Curious to dive deeper
277,Im not sure what it is either but I guess that means it was long ago lol,Neutral
277," Haha, very true! I didn't know Baseball managers wore uniforms...in case they need to  play! Cool",Happy
277,that is awesome all part of the team,Neutral
277," Exactly! Well, I will continue to follow a little baseball haha, and try and watch the World series as well. You have a great night! Great chat!",Happy
278,Do you like baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
278,I do - it was my favorite sport as a kid.  I even knew the married couple who scheduled all 2000+ games every year,Neutral
278," I didnt know about them, I guessed they had a talent for that, can you imagine the time that would take!",Curious to dive deeper
278,Yes it was a lot of work.  I just wish my grandfather had saved baseball cards - one lucky man found 3 million dollars worth of them in his grandfather's attic,Surprised
278," 3 million dolars no kidding! that is awesome, what a lucky break he had,",Curious to dive deeper
278,For sure.  Wonder if baseball cards exist in Japan?  The game is really popular there as well,Curious to dive deeper
278," I bet they due, they really love the sport our there, do you have a favorite baseball team?  I like the Yankees",Curious to dive deeper
278,I am an Atlanta Braves fan but I could not help but love the Cubs when they finally won the World Series a few years ago,Neutral
278," Yeah I bet they were really exited, they could lift that curse finally",Curious to dive deeper
278,Yes they won back to back world series and then never won again for years,Curious to dive deeper
278,Babe Ruth was caught stealing a base and then his team lost back in the year 1926,Curious to dive deeper
278,Yeah talk about blowing the world series for your team - in game 7 even!,Surprised
278," I know right, he still was considered a legend, things could have turn out differently if he didnt had the guts to steal that base",Curious to dive deeper
278,Yes.  baseball is not as popular as it once was though - the womens world cup had higher tv ratings than the world series,Neutral
278," It did? Wow, that is suprising, womans sports usually dont get support at all",Curious to dive deeper
278,yes as little as foreign sports!  During the 92 series the us marines carried the canada flag into the stadium upside down!,Curious to dive deeper
278," I wonder why, do you know the reason for that?",Curious to dive deeper
278,An accident I think!  They were clueless.  I hate the Yankees because they win so much.  Do you like them?,Surprised
278," I like them yeah lol, did you know theres a Lost Yankees player!!",Curious to dive deeper
278,How did they lose him?  I knew that two Yankee pitchers swapped families permanently.  Not sure what was up with that!,Curious to dive deeper
278," That is werid, I can undertand if it was a temporary thing but making it permanent, wow, I bet they hated their families",Curious to dive deeper
279," Hi! I recently learned that baseball managers are required to wear uniforms as well because they have to technically play should there be a need. So that must mean, they must stay in shape too right?",Surprised
279," that is interesting, do you think they ever played in a game ?",Curious to dive deeper
279," I don't think so, I don't watch too much baseball and I don't collect cards either, but I might reconsider seeing how valuable they are when a man found three million dollars worth of cards in his grandfather's attic!",Surprised
279," I had heard about that, imagine being set for life overnight like that!",Curious to dive deeper
279,How would you sell it? I imagine the buyers would be a small population.,Curious to dive deeper
279," I suppose so, do you think he took a loss in value trying to sell them for what he could get?",Curious to dive deeper
279,I think I would and I wonder if he knew the value when he sold them. If he didn't that would be very painful.,Sad
279,That really would be sad if someone exploited him,Curious to dive deeper
279,Do you have a favorite baseball team? Mine is the Yankees.,Curious to dive deeper
279," I am not too into baseball, but who is the ""lost"" yankees player?",Curious to dive deeper
279," Yeah that's a little frightening and do they mean ""lost"" as in lost his way because of the fame or ""lost"" as in missing?",Curious to dive deeper
279," I am not sure, I just know there is a lost one. I heard once they suspended mattingly because he would not get a haircut",Curious to dive deeper
279,The players to don a certain haircut? That's pretty strict! I wonder whether or not people still try to sneak into those games like what Bill O' Reilly did with the fake press pass. That's pretty smart since computers and photoshop didn't seem to be too popular back then.,Happy
279," That is true, you can get away with a lot back then, now we know too much!",Curious to dive deeper
279," Yeah, have you ever been to a live game?",Curious to dive deeper
279," i have not, I know it is America's pastime though!",Curious to dive deeper
279,I would argue that it was football! I didn't know there was a women's world cup has well and it even had higher television ratings than the world series!,Surprised
279," I would as well, but apparently it is very popular in japan as well!",Curious to dive deeper
279," I wonder when they carried the flag upside down in the 1992 world series, whether or not that was the doing of Japan.",Curious to dive deeper
279,Maybe it is because it was the canadian flag?,Curious to dive deeper
279,Oh it was the Canadian flag! What was the Marine Corps doing carrying around the Canadian flag instead of the US flag?,Curious to dive deeper
279," Maybe they carried both, I am not sure!",Curious to dive deeper
279," I see, well it was great chatting with you! Have a good day!",Happy
280,hey there what do you know about baseball,Curious to dive deeper
280," I know that it is a sport, played with a ball called a baseball. There are bases, and players, and bats. And hot dogs and popcorn.",Neutral
280,haha hot dogs sound good! and yes the objective is to hit the ball and run around the bases to get to home plate,Happy
280," It is one of the few sports in which the player scores points, not a ball or puck.I wonder how much each baseball costs to make.",Neutral
280," thats a good question, but you could buy a lot fo baseballs if you found millions of dollars worth of cards in your attic like that one guy",Surprised
280,He must have wondered why his grandfather didn't do anything with them. I would sell some and keep some.,Neutral
280," ya kind of a bum move to sel all your grandpas cards, especially since theyve been there since 1940",Surprised
280,He might have needed the cash. Did you know that the opposing team receives three bases if a player catches a baseball in their cap? I've never heard that rule.,Neutral
280,wow didn't know that! also didn't know baseball is super popular in Japan,Surprised
280," Very popular, but not as good as the US version. Different experience in the stadium as well.",Neutral
280," I've heard that, funny the Japan are surprised that baseball is actually americas pasttime haha",Surprised
280,They have something called the Japan series. It doesn't draw the attention of the World Series.,Neutral
280," huh I'll look into it, can you believe until 2005 a husband and wife team scheduled all the MLB games?",Surprised
280,They must have had a computer to help them. All those games? It couldn't be done on paper.,Neutral
280," ya I agree, like 2500 games to schedule a year, that would get tedius!",Surprised
280," I wonder how much they got paid. The Cubs haven't had much luck, have they. They were the first baseball team to win back-to-back world series; and haven't won since.",Neutral
280," no you're right, what do you think about the Yankees?",Curious to dive deeper
280," They have too much money. In general, there is too much superstition  in baseball. Ben Affleck caused the production of Gone Girl to shut down for 4 days because he refused to wear a Yankees cap on screen.",Neutral
280,its funny they started out as the Highlanders but changed their name in 1913,Surprised
280,The Yankees is a very American name. Their logo comes from a medal designed for a police officer.,Neutral
280," oh thats cool, wild that they have the 2nd highest attendance in the league!",Surprised
280,The Yankees are an institution. They've won the most World Series.,Neutral
280," ya, and I don'w know but apparently the Yankees ""lost"" a player somehow, do you know about that?",Curious to dive deeper
281," How's it going, do you follow baseball much? The Dodgers beat the Braves 6-0 in game 1 of the national league division series",Curious to dive deeper
281,I follow a little. That is exciting for Dodger fans.,Happy
281,Yea their starter Ryu had a great game pitching 7 innings without a run,Neutral
281," I heard Maz Muncy had a three-run, second inning blast. ",Happy
281," Yea it's amazing how many home runs were hit last season, with the Yankess setting a record 267 in a season",Surprised
281,Home runs make the game more exciting!,Surprised
281," Yep, 7 of the playoffs teams in the division round were in the top 10 for Home Runs last season",Neutral
281,That is amazing. I just learned that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises.,Surprised
281,Yea I remember Pete Rose played a few games while as a manager,Neutral
281,I have never heard that before. I always thought it was funny to see the managers dressed up.,Curious to dive deeper
281," I wonder if baseball managers in Japan ever play, apparently Japanese fans are surprised to find out baseball is considered America's pasttime",Neutral
281,I wonder why they are surprised by that?,Curious to dive deeper
281," I guess Japan really loves baseball lol, I wonder if they have valuable cards like the one worth 3 million dollars found in a grandfather's attic",Curious to dive deeper
281,I wonder if its newly popular or if its been there for awhile.,Surprised
281," I don't know, it's funny the ottoman empire was still in existence the last time the Cubs won the World Series",Surprised
281,I wish there was a date to reference.,Surprised
281,I believe it was 1908 before the Baltimore Orioles moved to NY and were renamed the Yankees,Neutral
281,Wow! It is funny that kickball is also called soccer-baseball in canada!,Curious to dive deeper
281," Lol, it's pretty funny Bill O'Reilly invented a fake press organization to get free season tickets to the Yankees",Neutral
281,I wonder where the lost yankee player is,Curious to dive deeper
281," Well I got to go, maybe I'll look for him",Neutral
282," Hi, are you a baseball fan? My favorite team is the Yankees, they have been around since 1901",Curious to dive deeper
282," Yes, Phillies my team.  Yankees lost me a bet for a $1 with my grandma when I was very young so I gave up on them.  Did you know that Roberto Osuna hasn't pitched since May 6 serving a 75 game suspension",Curious to dive deeper
282," I knew he was suspended but not for that long,what team is he on now?",Surprised
282,I believe the Astros,Curious to dive deeper
282," Oh, I knew he was on the blue jays, that's a pretty high risk trade considering Osuna violated the domestic violence policy",Neutral
282,Yes.  Apparently the Yankees trade with the Reds for Chapman before the 2016 season when Chapman was set to serve a suspension for a domestic abuse incident is similar,Surprised
282," Yea, I remember that, although Chapman is a great closer I wish the Yankees wouldn't of traded for him in 2016 due to his incidents",Disgusted
282,It seems risky.  But the Astros seemed to want a late-inning reliever badly enough to get Osuna,Surprised
282," Yea, as former world series champions they started to get worried they only had a 4 game lead in their division",Neutral
282,Did you know that a married couple scheduled all the major league games for 24 years up until 2005,Curious to dive deeper
282,Now but that must of took them a lot of time,Surprised
282,A man found $3 million  in baseball cards in his grandfather's attic,Surprised
282,I'm surprised they were still in good condition after being hidden since the 1940s,Surprised
282," Yes, I wish I found them.  Interestingly speaking of baseball it says that in 1973 two yankee pitchers switched families permanently.  I wonder what that means?",Surprised
282," I'm not sure either, maybe they both divorced their wives and then married them",Curious to dive deeper
282,In August 1991 Don Mattingly was actually suspended for not getting a haircut.  I wonder if they still enforce that rule?,Surprised
282," It's possible, I know they made Johnny Damon cut his hair and shave his beard when he signed with the yankees",Neutral
282," Wow.  Interestingly, the woman's world cup had higher TV ratings than the world series in the U.S. That is cool.",Surprised
282," That's cool, I think that was the year the US women won the world cup",Neutral
282,great!  The ottoman empire was still around when the Chicago Cubs last won the world series.,Surprised
282," Lol, I think they need to update that fact unless the ottoman empire made a resurgence a couple years ago",Neutral
283,So how bout them Yankees?,Curious to dive deeper
283,How are they doing?,Happy
283,They are perennially amoung the leaders in the MLB attendance and made the post season 2 years in a row,Happy
283,Do you believe that Osuna has served a 75 game suspension due to domestic violence,Happy
283," That's crazy, I don't know what the Astro's were thinking taking the trade from the Blue Jays",Surprised
283,I wonder why he's allowed back,Angry
283,I guess it's his first offense and they are waiting to find out about his upcoming court hearing,Curious to dive deeper
283,oh.  the Astros think Osuna is remorseful and had enough counseling to not harm anyone in baseball I guess,Curious to dive deeper
283," I guess they are giving him a ""fresh start"" which means as long as he plays good we don't care",Angry
283,He says he won't let them down.,Surprised
283," If they are serious of giving him a fresh start they should wait till next year, he hasn't pitched in the majors since May 6 anyway",Neutral
283,The trade left the Astros in a sticky situation.  All that money invested and what return yet,Curious to dive deeper
283," I heard the Nationals might trade Bryce Harper, maybe Houston should have tried to get him instead",Curious to dive deeper
283,They might need him,Curious to dive deeper
283,He's good but not as good as Aaron Judge though,Neutral
283,Hopefully Aaron Judge will not be out for more than 3 weeks,Curious to dive deeper
283," Yea, he's the face of the franchise now since Jeter left",Curious to dive deeper
283,Did you know the Yankees had been the Highlanders?,Curious to dive deeper
283," Yea I read about that a long time ago, I didn't remember them starting off as the Baltimore Orioles though",Surprised
283," Yes, that is strange and I wouldn't have known that.",Surprised
283,I didn't know they shared Shea Stadium with the Mets in 1974 and 75 either,Surprised
283," Wow, interesting fact.  I never heard that one either",Surprised
284,What do you think about the Orioles and the signing of Alex Cobb?,Curious to dive deeper
284," well I think theyre doing what they need to do but I don't know much about baseball, do you?",Curious to dive deeper
284," I know a bit, I tend to follow some of the games and I think that it was a good call, baseball is an interesting sport indeed, many cool facts about the game",Curious to dive deeper
284," oh ya for sure, like how the MLB uses 160k balls in a given year for all their games",Surprised
284," Thats a lot of balls, just like a single couple used to schedule all of the 2430 games of the league, seems like a lot of hard work",Curious to dive deeper
284," that does seem like a lot of work, did you hear that a 17 year old girl struck out Babe Ruth, I wonder what happened to her",Curious to dive deeper
284,Really? a 17 year old struck out one of the greatest players of the history of the game!!! thats crazy!!,Curious to dive deeper
284," yup, she should have gone pro, do you know what happens if youre in the outfield and catch a ball with your hat in baseball?",Curious to dive deeper
284," No, what happens if you do that?",Curious to dive deeper
284," well you apparently get 3 bases, I never knew that",Surprised
284," Really? I wonder why it doesnt happen often, I havent seen it, that would be interesting to see though. ",Curious to dive deeper
284," nope I think they should do that more, do you like the Yankees?",Curious to dive deeper
284," I think they are a great team, the team has a lot of history for sure, do you like them?",Curious to dive deeper
284," I do actually, they win a lot and I like winning teams haha, I guess they were created in 1901",Surprised
284," Its a winning team for sure lol, you know that in 1973 pitchers just swapped families permanently, that seems really odd",Curious to dive deeper
284," haha wow that is odd, pretty dumb how Ben Affleck refused to wear a Yankees hat because he was a red sox fan",Surprised
284," It does seem dumb but I guess I can respect that, he must feel identified with his team, you know that a player got suspended because he refused to get a haircut!!",Curious to dive deeper
284," wow that seems dumb! kind of weird that their uniform doesn't put names on the backs, they say it takes away the attention from the team",Surprised
284,Yeah so what do you think about the World Series? its been played for more than a hundred years a lot of history there,Curious to dive deeper
284," ya I don't watch it but I'm glad its there, I guess its ya been going on since about 1903",Curious to dive deeper
284," Yeah since the year 1903, its been a long time for sure, the Chicago Cubs were the first team to win it back to back,",Curious to dive deeper
284," yup and then they didn't win it for like 70 years or something, I guess the Dodgers have lost more world series than any other team which also stinks haha",Surprised
285,Do you like baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
285,I do like baseball. I can't wait for the season to start. Do you like baseball?  Did you know that it evolved from a game in England?,Neutral
285," I do like the game, yeah, and no I didnt know that, I wonder why its not popular in England then",Curious to dive deeper
285,I don't know.  Baseball is a form of an old bat and ball game played there back in the mid-18th century.  It's weird that it's popular in the US and especially Japan and not there.,Neutral
285," It is odd, maybe as odd as the managers wearing uniforms in the field, ",Curious to dive deeper
285,I've always wondered why they do that.  I assume it's to show team membership but I don't really know.,Neutral
285," Its because they can also play if they think its the best thing, if the need arises they can step into th field, did you hear about that man that found 3 million dollars worth of cards in his attic",Curious to dive deeper
285," So a manager can play?  I didn't know that.  If we are talking about the same man he found old baseball cards, right?",Neutral
285," Yeah he found card that belonged to his grand father, they were just hidden in the attic, crazy luck right!",Curious to dive deeper
285,Definitely!  Those cards had been hidden away since the 1940s!  I guess the people living there either never went in the attic or never looked around.,Neutral
285,So you said you liked baseball so maybe like the Yankees? what are your thought on the team,Curious to dive deeper
285," I like the Yankees.  There's some odd stuff with them though.  I mean, did you hear about the two pitchers that swapped families permanently back in 1973?",Neutral
285," I didnt, why would they do that lol, that is really odd I have to Google that",Surprised
285," It is really odd but I guess it was the 70s  so who knows.  I've even heard there is a""lost"" yankees player.  That is especially odd to me.",Neutral
285," What does that even mean, a ''lost'' Yankees player? can you elaborate more about it",Curious to dive deeper
285," I really can't, sorry. I just heard that one thing, a lost player.  No one ever expanded on it to me.  ",Neutral
285," Oh I see, well nothing Google cant solve then,  you know  a player got suspended because he refused to take a haircut",Curious to dive deeper
285,No I didn't!  What player?,Neutral
285," His name was Don Mattingly, crazy right, that happened back in the year 1991",Curious to dive deeper
285," You know, I would have thought it would have been much longer ago than that.  I guess I just figured there were stricter rules on hair back in the day.",Neutral
285," I guess so, still sounds a bit stupid to suspend a player just because of that, I think he was a key player for the team so yeah. ",Curious to dive deeper
286,Hi there!  Are you a baseball fan?,Curious to dive deeper
286,Not really.  I find the sport difficult to watch and slow.  What about you?,Neutral
286,I like it.  I think because it just it's something that always makes me think of warm weather and summer time.  Did you know they call kickball soccer-baseball in Canada?,Happy
286," It is nice to sit outside and watch a baseball game in warm weather. I agree.  I didn't know they call kickball ""soccer-baseball"" in Canada.  That is funny.",Surprised
286,I wonder why they call it that.  I'm always wondered why baseball managers wear uniforms...I guess they can play for their teams if needed.  Interesting.,Happy
286,Do you know who the baseball player Angel Hernandez is?,Curious to dive deeper
286,He is actually an umpire.  He has a bad reputation for blowing calls.,Happy
286,That's what I heard.  And he tried to accuse the Yankees and Joe Torre of discrimination against him.  I think being an umpire must be difficult,Curious to dive deeper
286,I wouldn't want to be one.  Especially the ref in the NFL who blew that call against the Saints and cost them a chance of going to the super bowl.  You'll have to google it if you don't know about it.,Surprised
286,I heard about that in the news.  Same thing with being a ref in a tennis match or a soccer match.  It's a tough job.  At least there is video playback.  But human error plays a roll always.,Curious to dive deeper
286,It does.  Did you know that baseball is really popular in Japan too?,Curious to dive deeper
286,Yes I did.  It is popular in South Korea too.,Neutral
286,There's been a few Koreans who have played in the MLB.  Shin Shoo Choo from the Rangers is from there.,Happy
286," Oh okay, cool.  Do you like watching World Cup soccer?",Curious to dive deeper
286,I do.  I watch it when I can.,Curious to dive deeper
286," I heard that more people in the US watched Women's World Cup soccer than the World Series, which I find hard to believe.  The final games of the Women's World Cup are always very exciting though.",Surprised
286,I believe it!  Soccer is super popular compared to baseball.  Speaking of the world series...did you know that Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 of the 1926 series.  I wonder if he was playing for the Yankees then.,Happy
286,Wow!  Well soccer is an easier game to watch than baseball.,Surprised
286,It is.  More action.  I wonder if they have hair length rules in soccer?  Don Mattingly of the Yankees once got suspended because he refused to get a haircut.  lol,Happy
286," I don't think so in soccer.  Many of the men have long hair.  Remember Alexi Lalas with the long hair?  Speaking of baseball, did you know a female pitched was once booted from MLB for striking out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig?",Curious to dive deeper
286,You're right!  A lot of them tie their hair back.  I didn't know that.  How interesting!  It's been fun chatting with you!,Surprised
286,Same here! I didn't know there was a female pitcher to Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.  Have a good evening!,Surprised
286,I'm going to have to look that up.  You have a good evening too!,Happy
287,Do you like baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
287,I love it. Do you know why the managers wear uniforms during games?,Curious to dive deeper
287,Yes they can play if their teams need them so they need to be ready,Curious to dive deeper
287,Yes. Do you know what kickball is called in Canada?,Curious to dive deeper
287,Yes it is called soccer-baseball,Curious to dive deeper
287,Yes I guess it makes sense that it has elements of both games,Curious to dive deeper
287,Yeah. Do you know who used to do the MLB schedule?,Curious to dive deeper
287,Yes it was a couple that did it for a whole 24 years,Curious to dive deeper
287,Yes and they scheduled 2430 games each year,Curious to dive deeper
287,Yeah amazing. In Japan the sport seems to be really popular,Curious to dive deeper
287,Yes so popular that they cannot believe it is a pastime here,Curious to dive deeper
287," Yes, they must really be into it and appreciate the sport",Curious to dive deeper
287,yeah. Do you watch the World Series?,Curious to dive deeper
287,Yes I do. Do you know when it started?,Curious to dive deeper
287,Yes it was back in 1903 so it is already over 100 years old,Curious to dive deeper
287,Yeah. Did you know the ottoman empire was still around when it started?,Curious to dive deeper
287,Yes that us pretyy cool. Did you know CUbs won the championship back to back two years?,Curious to dive deeper
287,Yes and then they went dry for quite a while after that,Curious to dive deeper
287,Yes The women's world cup has more viewers than the World Series though,Curious to dive deeper
287,Pretty awesome. Nice chat!,Curious to dive deeper
287,Same here and have a good one,Curious to dive deeper
288,Do you like baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
288,I love baseball.  Opening day is only 2 weeks away,Happy
288," Only 2 weeks away wow I am really exited, I mostly watch the World Series though. ",Curious to dive deeper
288,Well there have been some pretty memorable world series over the years.  It was first held in 1903,Curious to dive deeper
288,Wow so more than a hundred years since the first game. Did you like Babe Ruth?,Curious to dive deeper
288," I mean, I never saw him play live, but I do think he is one of the best ever.He helped make the Yankees a powerhouse ",Curious to dive deeper
288,Yeah event the bests make mistakes he cost his team the title back in 1926,Curious to dive deeper
288," Yes, Babe tried to steal second base and it did not work out well",Curious to dive deeper
288," No it didn't work well at all. The Cubs were the first team to win the WS back to back, I guess that didnt work for them either",Curious to dive deeper
288,And that was the last time they won until 2016.  Quite the long layoff,Happy
288," Yeah, it seems like the team had a real curse on top of them, the Woman's World Cup had a higher rating that the World Series. ",Curious to dive deeper
288," Well the World Cup does just come around every four years, so I can see how it would be popular on TV",Curious to dive deeper
288,I guess that makes sense still World Series is really popular in the states and woman's soccer team arent as popular.,Curious to dive deeper
288,Well baseball is not as popular as it was back in the day.  Too many things are competing for viewers time,Curious to dive deeper
288," I guess its not, there are a lot of sports out there, I do like the Yankees and the history the team has",Curious to dive deeper
288,They have the most wins in history by a large margin,Curious to dive deeper
288,Did you hear about Bill O'Reilly and how he invented a fake press organisation to get season tickets,Curious to dive deeper
288,He is a well known yankee fan.  I would not put it past him,Surprised
288,Maybe he found another way to get tickets by now and what about Don Mattingly interesting how he got suspended,Curious to dive deeper
288,They have a strict dress and apperance code on the Yankees.  He should of gotten a haircut.,Curious to dive deeper
288," Yeah I wouldnt fight against the team and just get one already, anyway its been great chatting with you today. ",Curious to dive deeper
288,You too.  Have a good one.,Happy
289,Good morning! How are you today? I am sure glad baseball season is back! Are you familiar with the game?,Curious to dive deeper
289,I played when I was younger.,Curious to dive deeper
289," I wish I played, but only neighborhood games. Do you follow any baseball now? I find it amusing that MLB team managers wear uniforms because they can play if needed.",Surprised
289," I follow the Nationals, what about you? ",Curious to dive deeper
289,I follow the Chicago Cubs. Have you heard about the guy that found the hidden baseball cards?,Curious to dive deeper
289," Yeah, apparently they were worth millions of dollars. ",Curious to dive deeper
289," Yes! Hidden away in his grandfathers attic since the 1940's. I wonder if the grandfather forgot them, or hid them so someone would get a big surprise?",Curious to dive deeper
289,I'm not sure. It has me thinking about the time my mom threw away my card collection.,Curious to dive deeper
289," Oh, hopefully no good ones. Isn't it funny that soccer-baseball is the name for kickball in Canada.",Surprised
289," Yeah, that is pretty funny. Is it a big sport up there? ",Curious to dive deeper
289,I am no sure. I know in Japan baseball is super popular.,Happy
289,I've known that for awhile. I'm surprised they don't know it is popular over here though.,Curious to dive deeper
289,I know! That shocks me too.,Neutral
289,Are you a fan of the World Series?,Curious to dive deeper
289," Yes, I am. As a Cubs fan it has been difficult. Prior to the 2016 win the Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time they won.",Surprised
289,Interesting. Did you know the cubs were the first team to win back to back world series.,Curious to dive deeper
289,Yes! Did you know Babe Ruth lost game 7 of the WS in 1926.,Surprised
289," Yeah, he got caught stealing. ",Curious to dive deeper
289," Yes, and they were already down by one run. I guess someone had to be that guy.",Sad
289," Yeah, that sucks. He was a great player too. Well, nice chatting with you!",Sad
289,Nice chatting with you too!,Neutral
289,Have a good day!,Happy
290,Did you know the space shuttle's computer only runs on 1mb of ram? That's crazy!,Surprised
290," That is crazy! my computer has a lot more juice than that, unbelievable how tech advances.",Surprised
290,I know! I can't imagine not having computers now since we have learned to depend on them so much.,Neutral
290," We sure do, I have an apple computer, I didnt know smoking near it would make my warranty void.",Surprised
290,Really? I didn't know that. back in 1936 some russians actually made a computer that ran on water....how strange is that.,Surprised
290," Really strange, I wonder what happened to that model? maybe water wasnt the best choice. ",Curious to dive deeper
290," Right! I don't even know how that would work. Very interesting though, also I read someone built a 16 bit computer using nothing but Minecraft building blocks, so crazy how these people get these idea's.",Surprised
290,I know,Curious to dive deeper
290,So do you like the piano?,Curious to dive deeper
290," I accidentally hit the enter tab, I was going to say I know, the world is full with creativity, and I do like the piano I like the sound of it.",Happy
290," Me too, I did play years ago but not anymore. I love the soothing sound of it. years ago the bbc didn't have any news worth reporting so the just played piano music lol that's awesome.",Happy
290,That odd considering the news giant BBC is today! did you know that Freddy Mercury played the same piano as Paul McCartney,Happy
290," My thoughts exactly! Oh wow that's an interesting fact! They built a piano for the Hindenburg and it only weighed over 300 pounds, who would think of putting a piano on that airship!",Happy
290," That takes some useful weight out of the plane, and maybe someone that is a real piano fan, would be nice to listen to it in the sky though.",Surprised
290," Very true. Piano music is great no matter where you are. It is like poetry to your ears, which I love too. I write some poetry and it's a great stress reliever :)",Happy
290," I do like poetry, do you like the series of Lord of the Rings? most of the hobbits names are actually names of poetry.",Happy
290,Oh wow I didn't realize that. I think it's crazy that Edgar Allan Poe only got paid 9 bucks for his famous poem The Raven. Not enough people realize how amazing poetry is.,Surprised
290," That is crazy as its one of the most remembered poems of history, it must be worth millions now a days.",Surprised
290," I know! A very different time back then. So many types of poetry too, I love it and song lyrics most of the time are like a poem. Love it.",Surprised
290," Yeah, did you know about the poem Demetri Martin wrote?",Curious to dive deeper
290,Is that the palindrome poem? Wasn't it like over 220 words? Amazing!,Happy
290," yeah, it was over 220 words, pretty impressive and actually good.",Curious to dive deeper
291,Hello! How are you today?,Curious to dive deeper
291,I'm doing well how about you?,Happy
291,Not too bad either! Do you play any instruments at all?,Curious to dive deeper
291,I do play the guitar. I heard that the piano is an acoustic instrument.,Surprised
291,Oh really? I never knew that! I guess the strings are struck by hammers huh?,Surprised
291,I guess so. Do you know who invented the piano?,Curious to dive deeper
291,Wasn't in by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 in Italy?,Curious to dive deeper
291,That is correct. The piano is being playing using a keyboard that has a row of keys that the pianist presses down to cause the hammers to strike the strings.,Surprised
291," That is one interesting fact! You know what is more interesting though, how computers have come about!",Surprised
291,I agree. Computers are more complex than pianos in my opinion because they are devices that carry sequences by computer programming.,Curious to dive deeper
291,Well said! I wish I could have used a computer that used water to run it like the Russians did!,Curious to dive deeper
291,Really!! I didn't know that the Russians did this. Do you know who wrote the first computer algorithm?,Surprised
291,No I don't! Who was it?,Surprised
291,It was by a woman named Ada Lovelace.,Curious to dive deeper
291,Oh cool! I wonder if she wanted to upload her mind to a computer like other transhumanists want to!,Curious to dive deeper
291,Wouldn't that be cool Ha!!! Do you know by any chance what was the number one installed piece of software on computers in 1995?,Happy
291,Was it something like Solitaire?,Curious to dive deeper
291,No. It was the video game Doom which I came across this fact very recently.,Curious to dive deeper
291," Thanks for that fact! I remember that game, it was so cool haha. It was nice chatting with you though and just remember, smoking near an apple computer voids the warranty haha.",Curious to dive deeper
291,I didn't know this. Thanks for sharing. It was very nice chatting with you. I hope you have a nice evening. Thanks and bye!!!,Curious to dive deeper
291,Thanks you as well!,Curious to dive deeper
292,Do you know anything about the dance program at Duke University?,Curious to dive deeper
292," No, I don't really but they recently celebrated the opening of the new Rubenstein arts center.",Happy
292,Who was Duke's first vice Provost for the arts?,Curious to dive deeper
292,Scott Lindroth I believe. I love how they have these applied arts programs to bring them balance and something different and meaningful to them.,Neutral
292," I heard that since his time, Duke has grown to have 98 student arts groups.",Surprised
292," That is really amazing, love this idea. they have so many more classes directed at the arts now more than ever which is awesome. ",Happy
292,I wonder how many programs are devoted to the acoustic piano?,Curious to dive deeper
292," I love the piano, but not sure how many programs are devoted to it. by aligning art making with research it makes for a much deeper learning experience though.",Happy
292,I am a fan too.    Odd that the modern piano has been around since roughly 1700!,Surprised
292," Right! L played years ago, and I also love poetry. Everyone should have a creative side they let out. It is amazing that they found a piano at the top of britains highest mountain....crazy to think how it got up there lol",Happy
292," It is funny that they test pianos with Circus Galop, a piece no human could play!",Surprised
292," Hahaha, that is odd! I love researching fun facts on the computer and you can find so much! I use my computer for everything, I write some poetry and save it to my computer.....you could probably find a program to teach you piano on the computer lol.",Happy
292," Perhaps so.    It is funny that poetry goes back to prehistorical times, but we still can not teach a computer to compose it well!",Surprised
292," Exactly, there will always be a need for human emotion which nothing tech wise could ever do. The Edgar Allan Poe poem, the Raven was fantastic and he was only paid 9 bucks for it. Wow....",Happy
292," Conversely, something as simple as the Japanese Alphabet, when recited in order is also a poem!",Surprised
292," I think I read about that while on my computer, and that is amazing actually. I will have to look it up I want to see what it is all about!",Happy
292," Did you know that in 1936, Russians made a computer that ran on water!",Surprised
292," Really? That is awesome! something else to research on my computer, I love reading cool facts. Almost all of the Hobbit's character names were taken out of an old poem, how funny!",Happy
292,Indeed!     I wonder if something similar inspired Demetri Martin's 224 word palmindrome poem.,Surprised
292," Exactly! I need to read that poem, must be very good. I am wanting to find that poem that is read normally is found to be depressing but reading it backwards is inspiring! Love that!",Curious to dive deeper
292,I am looking for some of the poetry from the pyramid texts!,Surprised
292,Oh wow! Now that would be very interesting! I may do that myself as well haha!  It has been great chatting with you!,Happy
292,You too.     I enjoyed sharing prosaic writing with you too!,Happy
293," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
293,Good! Did you know Kristen Stewart from the Twilight movies helped author a paper about AI? Not just a pretty face!,Happy
293," Wow, I had no idea! That's pretty cool. Isn't that one lady from Bri bang also like a pHd?",Curious to dive deeper
293," I'm not sure but wouldn't doubt it. Facebook is developing AI designed to better understand emotions, identify objects, and predict user actions. Yikes. ",Happy
293,Clifford seems to be a great way to augment teaching. I would like to see a pre and post test with a control group to see how well the AI works.,Curious to dive deeper
293,Interesting. At Stanford they use Google Hangouts to teach AI more effectively.,Happy
293,That's interesting. I teach college courses and would love to see how that works. I wonder if the non-for-profit has more info on it.,Curious to dive deeper
293,Good question. How about this one -- there's a NASA scientist who believes our world is just a computer generated VR. Maybe he's been watching too much of The Matrix.,Happy
293,That's nuts. I sometimes wonder if the ultra-intelligent need things to maintain their sanity...,Curious to dive deeper
293," Haha. Definitely. Overthinking can be a torture, I'm sure. The first Virtual Reality game was created in 1968. How far we've come!",Happy
293,I would love to go on Lockheed Martin's virtual reality tour of mars. seems like it would be a lot of fun.,Happy
293," It does sound fun. Up to 40% of VR users get motion sickness -- me included. So make sure to take your barf bag if you go, just in case. ",Happy
293,I never thought of that impact on people. Have you ever gone on 4D rides at like disney? They move and shake but then they also spray water on you for when you go through water tunnels or something like that. Pretty fun.,Happy
293," Yeah, I took my daughter on the Stitch ride and she FREAKED OUT! She thought it was real. I felt so bad. But that's proof that 4D can ramp up the experience. ",Happy
293,HA! How old is she? My 7 year old went on a roller coaster for the first time and freak out until the end and then I could not get him off the rides.,Curious to dive deeper
293,She was 11. But she has a really active imaginations and she loves Stitch -- so I think a part of her wanted it to be real. Wonder how she would do on that Lockheed Martin VR space bus you mentioned earlier?,Happy
293,I am sure she would do great! Are you on Facebook?,Curious to dive deeper
293," Yes, I'm on FB. Used to be on MySpace too, which offered to buy FB for $75 M in 2005. That would have been the buy of the century. ",Happy
293,I know! Wht dopes! Like Iceland rewritting its constituion using ti.,Fearful
293," There's a German state where it's illegal to use the ""like"" button on Facebook. Wonder what's that all about?",Happy
293,Nice chatting with you!,Happy
294,Hello - did you know MySpace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for 75 million in 2005?,Surprised
294," Hi, Are you a registered user of Facebook?",Curious to dive deeper
294," Yes I am, what about you?",Happy
294,Yes. I am thinking of joining the QuitFacebook movement though,Neutral
294,I'm not a huge fan of Facebook. I rarely use it.,Neutral
294,Did you invest in the company at the IPO in 2012?,Curious to dive deeper
294,I did not. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
294," No, but it would be worth a lot of money today if you had.",Neutral
294,It would be a big investment. Did you know the Facebook like button is illegal in one of the German states?,Surprised
294," No I did not. WHy is there not a ""dislike"" button",Curious to dive deeper
294,lol not sure,Surprised
294,They make most of their money off of ads,Neutral
294,Yea they make a lot off of ads. I saw that Facebook is blue because Mark Zuckerburg is red-green blind.,Surprised
294," Yeah, that is weird. I know how you can get a free whopper from BK",Neutral
294,How can you get a free whopper?,Surprised
294,If you unfriend 10 people on facebook,Neutral
294,That's pretty crazy and cool.,Surprised
294,I am thinking about going back to MySPace and deleting Facebook,Neutral
294,I didn't even know MySpace was still around. I would like to do that as well.,Surprised
294,I want to read the Icelandic Constituion on there first,Neutral
294,I don't know much about that.,Neutral
294,Time to check my posts on Facebook.,Neutral
295," When I previously thought of virtual reality I thought of gaming, but have you heard about its uses in the educational revolution?",Surprised
295," Hello there, same here, no I haven't seen too much about the educational side though. ",Curious to dive deeper
295," Through virtual reality, children will be able to attend virtual schools and learn how they want. Through their tablets or visually.",Curious to dive deeper
295," That is really cool, I guess they can get access to things and places that they never would have been able to before. ",Curious to dive deeper
295," Yes, for example if they want to learn visually they can use the headsets to travel to ancient Egypt and watch the pyramids get built!",Surprised
295," Wow, that is even cool for me and i'm an adult!  ",Curious to dive deeper
295," It is.  It is becoming a lot more affordable too.  It used to be over $1000, but in two or three years should be less than $100.",Happy
295," I think you are right, I think more schools will have these in the coming years as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
295," Yes, and can even use them at home to educate.  The program will allow the parents to keep tabs on their children to see how they are doing.",Happy
295,And I think all of those safety features for parents are a must with all technology these days!,Curious to dive deeper
295," Yes, safety and affordability.  With a lot of companies like Google, Lenovo, Magic Leap, and Facebook involved you know there will be an affordable and great product.",Curious to dive deeper
295,Yeah and I think there will be profitable business there as well so its win win for those companies as well.,Curious to dive deeper
295," Yes, agreed.  You even have a company like Lockheed Martin that can take kids on a virtual reality tour of Mars!",Surprised
295," Wow, now wouldn't that be something.  I wonder if they will be able to do that with planets further out in the future?",Curious to dive deeper
295,With all of those companies and a company like Facebook worth over $100 billion I am sure they sky the is the limit.,Happy
295,Exactly.  Do you use Facebook much?,Curious to dive deeper
295,I do.  I cannot believe in 2005 that Myspace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for $75 million!,Surprised
295," Right! That would have been one of those deals of a lifetime, but mistakes happen. ",Curious to dive deeper
295," It is impressive how huge it has become.  In fact, Iceland is literally rewriting their constitution using Facebook.  They allow the public to chime in with suggestions! Wild!",Surprised
295," Yeah I saw that, very interesting.  But, it makes sense though, let the people help control how the government operates, not the other way around. ",Curious to dive deeper
295," Yes, basically the opposite of the German state Schleswig-Holstein where the ""like"" button is illegal. ",Neutral
295," That is hilarious, I wonder if you went back in time and told people 30 years ago about that, what they would say? Anyways, it's been nice talking with you, I hope you have a good day. ",Happy
296,Hi!  Are you a facebook user?,Curious to dive deeper
296," Yes, I do use it, but mostly for the games app's social part. I'd rather play a game. I've heard the Virtual Reality video games are pretty cool. Would you try?",Curious to dive deeper
296,I think I would try it to see what it was like.,Happy
296,I've seen lots of examples on Facebook of people playing a VR game and getting terrified or surprised. It looks like a lot of fun!,Curious to dive deeper
296,I wonder how much the headsets cost for it?  The fist virtual reality game was made in 1968.  I had no idea they were around then.,Happy
296," I thought I've heard that VR has been used for training soldiers, so I wonder if it could have been around for even longer than 1968, but kept secret!",Curious to dive deeper
296,Quite possible.  I read where 40 percent of users experience motion sickness in virtual reality.,Happy
296," Well, that part doesn't sound very fun. Did you know there is a NASA scientist who genuinely believes we're living in a reality generated by a computer? Or maybe multiple computers...",Curious to dive deeper
296," I didn't know that.  I know that Lockheed Martin has a virtual reality ""Mars bus"" that can take kids on a tour of Mars.  That would be neat.",Happy
296," Wow, I was excited when I heard a company was starting art buses to park in lots of shopping centers to look after kids while parents shop. I can't even imagine how great a VR Mars tour bus would be!!!",Curious to dive deeper
296,Hahaha  Do you know anyone that has the Oculus Rift VR headset that Facebook released?,Curious to dive deeper
296," I don't, but I'd love to try it. I am really interested in those augmented reality systems that area a type of VR. I had an idea for those Google glasses before they came out, even!",Curious to dive deeper
296,Nice!  Stanford's free artificial intelligence class uses Google plus hangouts to help them teach more effectively.  What do you think of AI?  It kind of scares me. lol,Happy
296,Meant to say augmented reality. I think it's strange how Tesler's Theorem for AI is whatever hasn't been done yet. Does that mean he wouldn't call the VR games AI?,Curious to dive deeper
296," I have no idea.  Good question.  AI has crushed all human records in the puzzle game ""2048"".  I haven't heard of that game.",Happy
296," I haven't heard of that game, either. There's a game I play where you get better by doing daily tasks. I should make an AI device to do it for me!",Happy
296,lol Nice!  Did you hear about the promotion that Burger King ran where if you were to unfriend 10 people on Facebook they would give you a free whopper?  I would have taken them up on that.,Curious to dive deeper
296," I think there were probably people catching on and adding 10 random people just to unfriend, though! Can you believe that in a part of Germany the Facebook like button is illegal?",Curious to dive deeper
296,I wonder why?  I'm going to have to look that up.  I wonder what Myspace thinks of passing up on the chance to buy Facebook for $75 million in 2005?  Is Myspace even still around?,Happy
296,I think MySpace is around but everyone uses Facebook instead. I think Facebook is worth hundreds of billions today.,Curious to dive deeper
296,In 2012 when they had their IPO they were valued at $104 billion then.  So you are right. I'm sure it's more than that now.  It's been fun chatting with you!,Happy
297,How's it going? Do you know much about VR? Looks like it is not meeting it's potential as an educational tool,Curious to dive deeper
297," Hello there, I know just a little bit, I heard that is true though, that they don't really have the ability to customize the material to the individual or coach. ",Curious to dive deeper
297,That seems odd and something that would be easy to fix if the effort was put in. Learning history and geography seems like a perfect fit for VR,Surprised
297," Yeah I think you are right, especially for those children that are strong visual learners. ",Curious to dive deeper
297,VR does sound like a great tool for those who struggle with time limits,Neutral
297,Yeah I think it has the potential to be.  Do you know much about AI?,Curious to dive deeper
297," Not much except for what's in pop culture, I definitely couldn't explain Tesler's Theorem that well",Neutral
297," I think I'm about the same, I know IBM's Watson is very helpful in the medical field.  ",Curious to dive deeper
297,Yea I've heard of Watson and a little about Stanford's ai class which I might have to take a look at when I got the time,Curious to dive deeper
297,Did you know the actress Kristen Stewart co-authored a paper on AI?,Curious to dive deeper
297," No, I had no clue. I don't know if I'm more surprised of that or the first vr game being made in 1968",Surprised
297," Holy cow, I never would have guessed that about VR.  Did you know doctors are using it to treat phobias?",Curious to dive deeper
297," Yea, I've heard of that, very cool. Lockheed Martin uses VR to tour Mars which is pretty cool also",Neutral
297," Wow, that would be pretty cool to try, I wonder what you have to do to be a part of that?",Curious to dive deeper
297," I don't know, maybe be in a smart class or just be in a school that is nearby a Lockheed Martin facility",Neutral
297," Yeah you are probably right.  On a different note, are you a user of Facebook?",Curious to dive deeper
297," Yea, I think I started using it in 2006, two years after it was first founded by Zuckerberg and his Harvard classmates",Neutral
297," Yeah I think I am the same, I'm pretty sure my roommate in college set one up for me in 2005. ",Curious to dive deeper
297," I use to like myspace a lot better in high school, Tom must be kicking himself for not buying facebook in 2005",Neutral
297,Yeah think about how much money was lost not buying it way back then.  I think I set up a Myspace account but never used it.,Curious to dive deeper
297,Well FB is valued at 104 billion right now but it would probably be worth a lot less if myspace did buy it,Neutral
297," Yeah that is true, but I'm willing to bet it would be worth more than Myspace currently is. Well it was nice talking with you today, I hope you enjoy the rest of the day. ",Happy
298,hello,Neutral
298,Hello how are you doing? Myspace turned down an offer to buy facebook for $75 million in early 2005,Curious to dive deeper
298,i bet whoever was in charge regrets the hell out of it,Neutral
298," Right!  Missed opportunity! Facebook's ""like"" button is illegal in the german state of schleswig-holstein.",Curious to dive deeper
298,i wonder exactly what is so bad about it. The King of Pop started his solo career in 1971.,Curious to dive deeper
298,Yeah i know right.  Why are they so against the thumbs up.  Freddie mercury cancelled a duet with michael jackson in the 1980s,Curious to dive deeper
298," Freddy's vocals would've destroyed jacksons. also - a llama, really dude?",Neutral
298,hahaha well MJ is really weird.  Maybe it gives him inspiration!  Michael jackson wanted to build a 50 foot robot of himself to roam the nevada desert.,Curious to dive deeper
298,only thing i have in common with the dude is being a massive simpsons fan. if i ran into that robot i would think i was tripping,Neutral
298,Did he have a music video of him being this large silver man or something? lol Thats awesome that Michael was a simpsons fan!  I need to start watching it again.,Curious to dive deeper
298," you know, im not sure.....yeah! same here. havent really watched it much lately. taylor switf removed her music from spotify but kept it on pandora. think it was the money? ",Curious to dive deeper
298,Maybe.  This is a ton of money Aloe blacc only received $12k in royalties from pandora for 168 million streams,Curious to dive deeper
298,seems like someone got robbed. pandora makes 274 million in revenue,Neutral
298," This is amazing,  I love listening to stand up Pandora now streams stand up comedy in addition to music.",Curious to dive deeper
298,woah -  i had no idea. pandora is powered by the music genome project. ever heard of it? i havent,Curious to dive deeper
298,No I havent.,Curious to dive deeper
298,an effort to capture the essesne of music at the most fundamental level. i wonder what else they do.,Curious to dive deeper
298," yeah me too. On September 24, 2018, Sirius XM Holdings announced its intent to acquire Pandora for $3.5 billion.",Curious to dive deeper
298,Burger king had a promotion where if you unfriend 10 people on facebook you get a free whopper. LOL i couldve had whoppers for daaaaayyyys,Happy
298,haha what is the price of friendship???  whoppers!,Curious to dive deeper
298," ahaha, we can be real life friends eating whoppers.",Neutral
298,right!!  nice talking to you.  have a good one.,Curious to dive deeper
299,Are you on Facebook by any chance?,Curious to dive deeper
299," yes , I found it interesting that mark zukerburg suffers from colorblindness ",Neutral
299,I was not aware of that. Facebook debuted in 2004. I was not aware it had been so long. It makes me wonder how long I was on MySpace before that.,Surprised
299," I agree, I wonder why burger king wanted people to unfriend others ",Happy
299,I was not aware that they did. That's very strange. You'd think they'd rather advertise on the site since so many people are on there. Facebook makes most of it's revenue from advertisements.,Surprised
299,I understand that to be true also. I cant believe Iceland is using Facebook to rewrite their Constitution,Happy
299,That seems like a bad idea. People don't think before they type on Facebook and they're willing to be more ridiculous because they are behind a keyboard.,Fearful
299," Agreed. I have alsways really liked Micheal Jackson, and I knew he did work on the Simpsons",Happy
299," I have mixed feelings about him. As a pop star he was amazing, his personal life not so much. My understanding is that Freddie Mercury cancelled a duet with him because he insisted on bringing his llama to the studio.",Curious to dive deeper
299," Yes I understand the feelings, would have loved to see the 50 foot robot though",Surprised
299,He had some very out there ideas. I did know that Eddie Van Halen Played the guitar solo in Beat It free of charge.,Curious to dive deeper
299,I did not know that either. and that Micheal helped write the soundtrack to sonic 3,Happy
299,That seems very odd to me. Thinking back to the Sonic games they do not have music that I would have thought a high profile musician made.,Surprised
299," I would agree with that, but still good music. I knoew taylor swift removed her music from spotify but not pandora ",Happy
299,I wonder why? I use Pandora a lot. I often have it on when I exercise. They have a net income of $-16 million despite having $274 million in revenue. I really think they need to look into their overhead cost.,Surprised
299,I would agree. I know she didnt like how they pay artist. I did not know they were streaming comedy also,Surprised
299,I didn't either. I have never tried to use it for that. I use Podcast apps for that purpose. I'll have to look into that.,Surprised
299,They have plenty of streams at 168 million steams for Aloe Blacc,Surprised
299,That's a huge amount of streams. I did not realize until recently that Pandora was only available in the United States. I find that surprising.,Surprised
299,me too I found the music genome project interesting to learn about also,Surprised
299,Algorithms are always interesting to me.,Curious to dive deeper
300,I guess a disabled student who won a case against a TX school died recently.  Her name is Amber Tatro.,Sad
300," Yeah,  thats sad.  Do you used facebook?",Curious to dive deeper
300," Yes, but I'm not addicted... It was a tough SC case.  I'm not sure I agree that schools should have to perform medical procedure.  They are school not a hospital. ",Curious to dive deeper
300," Yes I agree,  unless they have medical training. ",Curious to dive deeper
300," It was all kinds of things with her... Infections, injections, etc... The school would need a team.  She got a standing ovation when she graduated. ",Happy
300,Right.  That is pretty amazing.,Curious to dive deeper
300,Facebook... It seems to have many uses.  Iceland is using to rewrite their constitution.  What do you use it for?,Curious to dive deeper
300," I use it for keeping in touch with people,  seeing what people are up to and news.  How about yourself?",Curious to dive deeper
300,That's the same with me.  I comment very little.  I didn't realize Facebook is blue because Zuckerburg is red-green colorblind...,Surprised
300," Me either.  I just recently saw the movie the social network,  its about facebooks start. ",Curious to dive deeper
300," Yeah, kids from Harvard -- wasn't it a student post board?  Myspace could have bought it for penny's...",Surprised
300," Yeah something like that.  I know right,  that was a huge mis opportunity on their part. ",Curious to dive deeper
300,Yeah.  Why would Burger King have a promotion to encourage others to unfriend others?  They offered a free Whopper to unfriend 10 people.,Curious to dive deeper
300," I dont know the reasoning behind it,  but I wouldnt mind a free whopper lol ",Curious to dive deeper
300," Yeah, that made me a little hungry.  Did you like Michael Jackson?  ",Curious to dive deeper
300," Yes,  love the king of pop.  You?",Curious to dive deeper
300," yeah, he was a talent for sure.  I can't believe he wanted to develop a 50 foot robot to roam the desert around Vegas.",Surprised
300,Hes always been a little different lol Did you hear freddie mercury cancelled a det with mj because he wanted a llama in the studio? lol,Curious to dive deeper
300,No.  I miss Freddie too...  strange reason to cancel... Do you listen to Pandora Radio?  The have comedian now.,Curious to dive deeper
300," Yes,  love pandora,  I do listen to their comedy on road trips and long drives. ",Curious to dive deeper
300," Yeah, ZM radio is cool too.  Thanks for the chat, you were great!",Neutral
301,Good Morning! Do you like to travel?,Curious to dive deeper
301," I do, I travel a lot for work, but even more for leisure. I wish I could use the commuter bus the Dutch are creating. It's designed to travel at 160mph!",Curious to dive deeper
301,I would rather do that than be in Iceland where there is no rail service!,Surprised
301,I agree with that. I wonder how many people there have never left their towns?,Surprised
301," I'm sure many are content where they are. I would hate to live in Japan though, it costs 300 dollars in tolls to drive across country.",Curious to dive deeper
301,That would be an expensive road trip. I wonder how the first king to travel around the world got around?,Curious to dive deeper
301,I think it was King Kalakaua of Hawaii to do that and that was long before airplanes!,Surprised
301,I wonder if he went to Mackinac Island? They've banned motorized vehicles there for over a hundred years. I bet it's peaceful there!,Curious to dive deeper
301," I bet it is, instead of hearing the snow plows like I am right now! Did you know the dodo bird was part of the pigeon family?",Surprised
301," I did not know that, that's pretty interesting. I've heard that some birds fly from Alaska to Norther Mexico without sleeping! That is wild!",Curious to dive deeper
301," I would be sleeping right away during that trip haha. Birds are smart, especially the ones that can mimic camera sounds in Australia!",Surprised
301," Yeah they are, and how hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests.",Surprised
301," I wouldn't know how they get the spider webs not to stick to them, I can never get them off me haha.",Surprised
301," I'm not sure either, haha they always stick to me too!",Curious to dive deeper
301,Have you heard of Machine Learning? it's the study of algorithms and mathematical models that computer systems use to improve performance.,Surprised
301," Yes, I actually studied it in college. I wish I could have wrote the algorithm that mines rap lyrics and writes its own!",Curious to dive deeper
301," That would make writing songs much more easier! I like how they can make double entendres like ""that's what she said"".",Curious to dive deeper
301,That is pretty cool! Ubisoft actually partnered with the British Museum to apply machine learning to speed the deciphering of ancient hieroglyphics.,Curious to dive deeper
301,Technology is just beyond cool! They can even monitor food poisoning with it!,Happy
301," It is amazing, possibilities are endless with it! Did you know the ""are you human "" test on many sites serves a second purpose?",Curious to dive deeper
301,I did not know that! All I know is that they are annoying when you have to wait for them to load lol.,Surprised
302,hi how are you? do you like animals?,Neutral
302,Hi there. I do like animals though I do not have pets. I think they should have rights so they are not hurt. There's a lawyer in Switzerland who represents them in court.,Surprised
302,i do not have any pets either. i would like a dog. that lawyer must have an interesting set of clients. LOL,Neutral
302,H&M was selling goat hair coats and there was video footage the improper treatment of the goats.,Sad
302," yeah, the source of clothing is often quite disgusting. people working under terrible conditions. child labor. its sad.",Neutral
302,H&M is trying to trace the source of all its products now.,Surprised
302," that is good. it is easy to lose control of the supply chain. where do the materials come from? well, it is a big planet.",Neutral
302,At least it seems more and more businesses are recognizing that transparency is important. I think because more consumers expect it.,Happy
302," yeah, we dont want to participate in a kind of oppression. we want clothes at a fair price.",Neutral
302," Speaking of saving money, there was a man who wore 70 items of clothing so he didn't have to pay for baggage. I don't think that would fly in the US haha",Surprised
302,he must have been enormous. did he make it through the x ray machine? did he fit in the seat?,Neutral
302," Right, haha. Bulletproof clothing often seems bulky as well. Bulletproof clothing mogul Miguel Cabarello shoots his employees to test the quality of his clothes.",Surprised
302,what?? that is crazy. his employees should shoot him a few times first. LOL,Neutral
302," Yeah, I know. I don't think he could pay me enough.",Surprised
302," yeah, really, there needs to be a danger pay, or a per bullet bonus or something ",Neutral
302,Yeah because we cannot live forever like the biologically immortal jellyfish and lobster.,Surprised
302,would you really want to live forever? i wonder if it would get boring or frustrating. it might be good to be frozen for a century then wake up for a bit. that would be fun.,Neutral
302," Not forever, maybe just longer, haha. In the Netherlands they try to help wildlife live longer by constructing bridges for them.",Surprised
302," that is thoughtful. the dutch seem to think a lot about nature. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
302," Yeah, makes me want to take a nature hike right now. Nice talking!",Happy
302,Have a great day! Bye!,Neutral
302,Have a good one!,Happy
303,Hello ! Did you know the brand ZARA banned the use of animal after an investigation?,Surprised
303,Hello - I did not know that.,Surprised
303," They were found to throw goats, I understand why people were shocked ",Sad
303,That's crazy. Did you know pilgrim clothing was full of color?,Surprised
303," Thats so interesting also, I heard they only wore black on special occasions, only humans wear clothing also ",Curious to dive deeper
303," Yes I saw that as well. There's a store in Alabama that only sells clothes, cameras, etc. that are found in unclaimed baggage. ",Surprised
303,Normally bigger corporations have enough power to make decisions like that. But that's not ethical is it,Curious to dive deeper
303,Yea I don't think that's ethical either.,Angry
303,I think it has a clear link with the use of animals by many companies.... Using fur without consent kinda resembles using unclaimed baggage,Disgusted
303,Yea I think so too.,Surprised
303,Germany was the first country to give rights to animals do you agree with that?,Curious to dive deeper
303,Wow I didn't know that. I agree with that though.,Happy
303," I do too, but I mean it includes animals like the lochness monster... haha",Surprised
303,haha. Did you know rip curl makes clothes in North Korea yet the label says China?,Surprised
303,Really ?? thats crazy ! isn't that so unethical also.... the people that make the clothes probably don't even get paid enough.... Apple did have a clothing line also but I mean it did not last,Curious to dive deeper
303,Oh wow that's funny Apple had a clothing line.,Happy
303,I bet it had apples all over it.... Did you know that many many companies are feeling the pressure to ban animal use such as faux fur?,Surprised
303," I did not know that. I don't own anything with fur, but it doesn't bother me if people do wear it. ",Surprised
303,Why does it not? do you agree with the companies?,Curious to dive deeper
303," Animals were put on this Earth for humans to use by God so as long as you're eating the meat, it doesn't bother me to use the fur along with it. ",Happy
303,Interesting point of view ! I still think they are right to ban it though,Disgusted
304,do you like colorful clothing?,Curious to dive deeper
304," I do just like the pilgrims, do you know when they wear black?",Curious to dive deeper
304,Yes only on special ocassions,Curious to dive deeper
304,Yeah. Do you know how they can tell if you need your clothes tailored?,Curious to dive deeper
304,Yes they look for collar gaps in them,Curious to dive deeper
304,Yeah. Did you hear of that store in Alabama with stuff from airports?,Curious to dive deeper
304,Yes they sell stuff that are left unclaimed at airports from people,Curious to dive deeper
304,Yeah I bet you they have all kinds of stuff there,Curious to dive deeper
304,Yeah I guess. DO you like animals?,Curious to dive deeper
304,I do. DO you know how many are there?,Curious to dive deeper
304,Yes about 20 quintillion individuals ones,Curious to dive deeper
304,I do not even know how many zeroes are in that,Curious to dive deeper
304,Exactly. Do you have a pet?,Curious to dive deeper
304,I have a dog and two cats and you?,Curious to dive deeper
304,I have a cat. Domesticated animals have a white patch on the forehead it seems,Curious to dive deeper
304,I do not think my pets have that though to be honest,Curious to dive deeper
304,Mine either. Do you know who we have hiccups?,Curious to dive deeper
304,Yes they are left behind from when animals had gills and lungs,Curious to dive deeper
304,Yeah. Did you know the loch ness monster is a protected species?,Curious to dive deeper
304,So cool. It was nice chatting with you,Curious to dive deeper
304," Same here, nice chatting with you",Happy
305,Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! :),Happy
305," Hello, what is your opinion on animal cruelty?",Curious to dive deeper
305,I hate when animals are being cruel... ;),Curious to dive deeper
305,Would you purchase a pair of shoes made of animal skin if they were on sale?,Curious to dive deeper
305,hmmm... are Martens made out of leather ?,Curious to dive deeper
305," I am not sure, but I am pretty sure.",Curious to dive deeper
305,I wanna say no.... but if they look pretty cool... and the animal is dead already... I mean... I won't change the world by myself by skipping a beautiful pair of Martens...,Curious to dive deeper
305," Animal are being killed for food, but I think there are other material can be used for clothes.",Sad
305,I guess so... but I feel like that's going to end soon because I've read an article about artificial meat genetically made... so maybe animals will be safe soon....,Curious to dive deeper
305," Yes, you are right. Did you know that some of the largest clothing chains discontinue selling mohair due to animal cruelty?",Curious to dive deeper
305," I mean that's great, but I think they are just doing that for the media coverage... I don't know, don't know much about fashion...",Curious to dive deeper
305,Maybe you are right. Mohair is made from the hair of a Angora goat for sweaters and coats.,Curious to dive deeper
305," oh, so the animal is fine ? After cutting the hair ? Or does it suffer ?",Curious to dive deeper
305," Oh, so the Angora sis much like a sheep?",Surprised
305," I'm not sure, I hope Angora is not suffering because somebody cuts it's hair...",Curious to dive deeper
305,I hope not either. Materials that made from the hair of these animals are expensive.,Surprised
305,I'm sure they are... hey - Apple had a clothing line in 1986. I didn't know that....,Curious to dive deeper
305," No, I didn't know that, all I know about apple is making and selling electronic products.",Surprised
305," Yeah, that's what I thought ! Maybe it's worth googling it after this HIT ;)",Curious to dive deeper
305," Yes, did you know what type of clothing were made by Apple?",Curious to dive deeper
305," That's the thing - I don't , but I would think it's something artificial - maybe worth looking into ; ",Curious to dive deeper
305,What do you think about a man wore 70 items of clothing at a Chinese airport to avoid bagging charge?,Surprised
305,I think he had to be really skinny :),Curious to dive deeper
305," You are so right, I am surprised he pass the checkpoint. ",Neutral
305,He was probably sweating like crazy ! lol :),Curious to dive deeper
305," Back to animals, I am a animal lover and I hope things will change in their favorite.",Neutral
305," I really think it will soon. Hey, Thank You so much for chatting with me ! ;)",Curious to dive deeper
305," Ok, nice chatting with you.",Happy
305,My pleasure ;),Happy
306,Do you like to travel?,Curious to dive deeper
306," I love to travel. Haven't gotten much chance lately, though. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
306," I love to travel as well, so relaxing I want to visit Mackina island, sounds like a really peaceful place",Curious to dive deeper
306,Where is that? I don't think I've ever heard of it.,Curious to dive deeper
306," That is actually located in the US, I cant recall where but motorized vehicles have been banned there for more than a century",Curious to dive deeper
306,Wow! Are they trying to keep a historical feel to the area?,Curious to dive deeper
306," Seems that way, the air must be clean and free of many of the pollutants we have in the city, Japan also seems like a great destination, kind of expensive though",Curious to dive deeper
306," Japan would be an amazing cultural experience, but travel inside the country is pricey, maybe even more than travel to the country!",Neutral
306,Yeah highway tolls cost more than $300 dollars thats too much money,Curious to dive deeper
306," I guess if you traveled there, it would be best to focus on one city so you don't have to spend on traveling around. It's probably expensive to travel in Iceland too. Most people there without cars take flights to get from city to city!",Surprised
306," That makes sense, seems like it would be just as expensive and the flight time is less, the firs king of Hawai sure traveled a lot",Curious to dive deeper
306,I wonder if he was surprised at the size of the world after ruling a small chain of islands for part of his life. I know I would be.,Neutral
306,Sounds like something to be excited about I bet he saw many kinds of birds in his travels,Curious to dive deeper
306," He probably saw some kinds that he had seen at home, since birds migrate so far. Some go from Alaska to northern Mexico!",Neutral
306," He probably saw a dodo bird, those are extinct now but maybe he had the chance to see one.",Curious to dive deeper
306," It's a shame they went extinct. The moa and the elephant bird have gone extinct too, but both of those were wingless birds.",Sad
306," There was an elephant bird? I bet it was massive, spiders must hate hummingbirds lol",Curious to dive deeper
306,I'd hate hummingbirds too if they kept stealing my house to make a nest! Thankfully they're a bit too small and lightweight for that.,Neutral
306," I bet hummingbirds wouldnt mess with bigger spiders, sounds like they are bullies but I hate spiders so I guess its ok lol",Curious to dive deeper
306," I'm with you - not a fan of spiders at all. Hummingbirds are beautiful to watch though, and penguins are my favorite animal. I'm on Team Bird over Team Spider.",Happy
306," Im on Team Bird as well so that makes two of us lol, I bet a lot of people would agree with us.",Curious to dive deeper
307,Do you like to travel?,Curious to dive deeper
307," Yes, I do. I dont often have the time or money to travel but i really do enjoy it.",Neutral
307,Me too. Did you know in Japan every highway is a toll?,Curious to dive deeper
307,the high speed highways impose a toll. the roads are not crowded though. you get what you pay for. did you want to go to Japan?,Neutral
307,I want to visit. Did you know that Iceland had no public rail service?,Curious to dive deeper
307," Yes, i did know that. Japan on the other hand has a tremendous rail service. if you plan to visit, the rail system is better than the highway. however the air travel in Iceland is probably cheaper.",Neutral
307,Did you know that bird's bones are hollow?,Curious to dive deeper
307," Yes, I did. they are stronger because they are hollow. lighter too. Did you know that birds have regional accents according to scientists?",Neutral
307," No, I didn't know that. I also didn't know the feathers weight more than their bones. ",Curious to dive deeper
307," I guess that is also true of crows, which are among the most intelligent of birds, and are even capable of imitating human speech.",Neutral
307,Interesting. What do you know about machine learning?,Curious to dive deeper
307," It is learning done by machines. Beyond that, not much. You?",Neutral
307,They have an algo that can mine rap lyrics and write their own.,Curious to dive deeper
307,That is very cool. Soon we will not need rap artists. We can have the machines do it for us.,Neutral
307," Hilarious. Yeah, it will be like that Beastie Boys song Intergalatic. ",Curious to dive deeper
307," Yes, that would be great. What else do you know that is interesting about machine learning?",Neutral
307," Apparently there are ""are you human "" tests that aid in the design of machine learning. ",Curious to dive deeper
307," Yeah, turing tests. this whole things we're doing right now is part of that study. Anyway, thanks for the phat chat!",Neutral
307," Right, that is what they are called. Nice chatting with you too. ",Curious to dive deeper
307,Have a good evening!,Neutral
307," You too, nice chatting. ",Curious to dive deeper
308,do you have a smart speaker? I have an alexa... but they kind of creep me out sometimes.,Curious to dive deeper
308," I don't. They look handy, but come off as kind of invasive.",Disgusted
308,yeah i think they can be... but it is useful. I like amazon products for the most part. it was way more affordable and versatile than the apple home speaker that was 350,Neutral
308," $350 really is too expensive. I get that Apple tries to go for the high-end market, but good grief.",Disgusted
308,siri was intended for android and blackberry initially and it's funny now because the amazon ceo talks about how limited it's abilities are now.,Surprised
308," Siri isn't even compatible with Spotify on the Homepod. When your assistant can't talk to your music to play on your speakers, there's a problem!",Surprised
308," i have a huge problem getting alexa to connect too sometimes tho. it always tries to open ""spotty control""... my husband and I always joke that we are an ""amazon family"" i didn't realize how true that was until I learned that amazon has owned IMDB since 98!",Happy
308,Since '98? No kidding! I guess it makes sense for a company that started as a bookstore to branch out into movies next.,Surprised
308," yeah, i remember when they only sold books. a distant memory i think. now the workers walk 7-15 miles each shift.",Curious to dive deeper
308,That makes me wonder how many miles the goats Google used to trim their grass traveled. Maybe 15 miles?,Curious to dive deeper
308,hahaha google has some wild things. I used to live in the bay and their workspace is very unique.,Surprised
308,You've seen the Googleplex? Neat! What's it like?,Surprised
308,they have a lot of different campuses all over palo alto and san francisco. it is very well kempt. and there are google bikes EVERYWHERE.,Happy
308,That sounds about what you'd expect from the provider of so much web traffic.,Happy
308,yeah when they went down for a bit a few years ago web traffic dropped 40%. yahoo must have been happy for five minutes.,Surprised
308," Poor Yahoo. Apple has Siri, Microsoft has Cortana... I'm sad that Ask.com isn't still around. I want to have Jeeves as my personal assistant!",Sad
308," that is a throwback. Cortana isn't very useful, but I like bing as a search engine...and i like that they pay you points that can be changed in for giftcards.",Happy
308,Cortana was helpful in Halo at least. Can't really picture Siri hanging out with Master Chief.,Happy
308,my friend met the siri lady in an airport once. that was interesting.,Neutral
308,Hah! I wonder how the male voice actors feel. Mr. Briggs didn't even know he WAS the voice until he heard himself in a commercial.,Surprised
308,yeah talk about being the weakest link. I wonder how that happens though...like don't they have to pay for his voice?,Surprised
308," Maybe it was some kind of contract work, and the client wasn't disclosed.",Curious to dive deeper
308," maybe that is a good point. thanks for chatting, I had a great time talking. :)",Happy
308," Me too! Best of luck to you and your ""Amazon Family!"" Take care.",Happy
309,DO you use siri at all?,Curious to dive deeper
309,I sure do. Do you know what she sings if you ask her to?,Curious to dive deeper
309,Yes she sings the same song as hal 9000 of space oddysey,Curious to dive deeper
309,Yes. Do you know where siri sends the questions that we ask?,Curious to dive deeper
309," Yes to a database in North Carolina, pretty scary",Curious to dive deeper
309,Yes that is why IBM are afraid of what siri might say,Curious to dive deeper
309,And they are right to be afraid. DO you know who is the voice of Siri in the UK?,Curious to dive deeper
309," It is a male, the same guy that did the voice in the Weakest Link",Curious to dive deeper
309,Yes his name is Jon Briggs and he did not know he was the voice of siri,Curious to dive deeper
309,Yeah until he heard an iPhone commercial. Do you use Google?,Curious to dive deeper
309,All the time. Do you know how much computing power a search requires?,Curious to dive deeper
309,Yes more than it took them to sent Armstrong and 11 others to the moon,Curious to dive deeper
309,Yeah . Do you know how they calculate traffic?,Curious to dive deeper
309,Yes they take the average of android devices in traffic,Curious to dive deeper
309,Yes. Google once hired goats to mow the lawn instead of people,Curious to dive deeper
309,That is so cool and different and also more environmentally friendly.,Curious to dive deeper
309,True. Did you know they went down for 5 minutes in 2013?,Curious to dive deeper
309,Yes and it took down 40% of web traffic down with it,Curious to dive deeper
309,That just speaks volumes  on how heavy its use it,Curious to dive deeper
309," I know, it is amazing. Nice chat",Curious to dive deeper
309,Same here and have a good one,Happy
310,Do you use siri in your house?,Curious to dive deeper
310," Hi! I use Siri sometimes by accident or sometimes when I am driving and can't take my eyes off the road. However, I do use Alexa around the house. Do you?",Curious to dive deeper
310," I've never used it, it is hilarious, because I have an iphone. I don't have alexa, I'm scared it will spy on me. ",Curious to dive deeper
310," Oh, yeah, usually Siri is turned off for me like on my other Apple devices, but I have found that it sometimes comes in handy for phones when driving although most of the times it's quite frustrating because they don't understand me and do something else. Considering Siri's best skill is being a musicologist, I will have to try out that feature some time.",Surprised
310," It scares me, I was unaware that Apple had something called the Homepod. ",Curious to dive deeper
310," Apple has restricted the scope of the HomePod's intelligence, considering that Siri gets things wrong about 10% of the time. It's nice that they built the technology so that everyone is treated the same, which raises privacy concerns because anyone can ask to read owner's messages.",Surprised
310," Yeah, do you use Cortana? The microsoft thing? ",Curious to dive deeper
310," No, I don't use that, do you?",Curious to dive deeper
310," No, but I find it to be very annoying. They took away the search functionality for that. ",Curious to dive deeper
310," Oh, I'm not too familiar with that. What do you mainly use it for?",Curious to dive deeper
310,I'm not sure to be hoenst. But did you know that siri was supposed to be for android originally?,Curious to dive deeper
310,That's surprising but I did know that Siri uses Bing search engine over google as its default search engine.,Surprised
310," Interesting, I did not know that. ",Curious to dive deeper
310,I would love to work at Google some day even if it means being called a 'noogler' and have to wear a propeller beanie cap because that's what new google employees are all succumbed to.,Surprised
310,Well apparently the guy from the weakest link does the voice.,Curious to dive deeper
310,Which voice are you referring to?,Curious to dive deeper
310,The birtish voice on Siri.,Curious to dive deeper
310," Oh ok, the American voice of Siri is a voice actor named Susan Bennett, she's also the terminal voice for Delta Airlines, I wonder whether she negotiated a licensing or royalty fee for her work.",Surprised
310,I didn't know that. What type of roles has she been in?,Curious to dive deeper
310," From what I read, Delta Airlines, subway terminals, voice of Siri, etc. I'm guessing any commercial voice you hear in public places might be hers.",Surprised
310," OMG, that is awesome. I bet Amazon workers are tired after walking 7-15 miles each day. ",Curious to dive deeper
310," They are definitely tired, but on the bright side, they probably don't need gym memberships because they might be in great shape!",Surprised
310,That's true. The first customer spent $27.95,Curious to dive deeper
311,Did you hear about the 300 crocodiles killed in Indonesia?,Neutral
311,Yeah I think that is sad. Us humans are invading these animals' space and we think we own the place.,Sad
311," I agree.  We dont even respect other humans, so animals definitely dont get any resepct.  We really need to treat every living thing with respect.",Sad
311,It's especially bad because it was a licensed sanctuary that Sugito wandered into to collect food. This was undoubtedly done without permission.,Sad
311,It is like when the kid fell into Harambe's cage.,Neutral
311," Right, I was mad about that one too. Police tried to stop the killings but there were 600 people so it was impossible.",Surprised
311,That is horrible.  There are 20 quintillion (yeah that is a number) animals on earth and humans are one.  Id say we are slightly outnumbered.,Neutral
311,Killing a protected species is a crime in Indonesia so it was just those people who were out of control. What's gross is the villagers took selfies with the crocodiles afterward.,Sad
311," I would get killing the one, but trying to exterminate a species because of one bad one is stupid.",Curious to dive deeper
311," Yeah, and I still don't think it's bad because the villager wandered into its habitat. But some people did question the logic of having crocodile ponds so close to a village.",Sad
311,Or rather building a village close to where the animals already live.,Neutral
311,What about the Disney World alligator? Did you hear about that one?,Surprised
311," I vaguely remember something about that, what was the deal with it again?",Curious to dive deeper
311,There was a sign that said stay away from the water but the parents let him get too close to the pond. He was scooping up water into a pail when he was snatched. Poor kid.,Sad
311," I remember that now.  I feel bad, it is just awareness. Some people have none",Neutral
311," Yeah, I heard that he was also playing in the water. And in this case they euthanized the alligator and humanely removed others.",Sad
311," Removal I can deal with, only if we were not intruding on their initial home.",Neutral
311,Yeah well I guess Disney World built where there were already alligators naturally. Seems pretty ineivitable in many areas of Florida that we would intrude. Sigh. I feel bad for the boy but the crocodile was probably just acting in its nature because it's a carnivore.,Sad
311," Thinking like this little snack wandered into my home, how nice.  ",Curious to dive deeper
311," Right.:/ And as humans we make handbags of alligators all the time. That being said,I'd be very protective of my children if an animal came to attack them.",Sad
311,True.  Its been great chatting!  Have a nice day!,Neutral
312,Are you a fan of Disney movies?,Curious to dive deeper
312," Hi, how are you? Yes, I do like Disney films. Loved them as a kid. I haven't seen one in a while though. What was the last Disney film that you saw?",Neutral
312," I saw Moana last, but also Frozen shortly before that, it was the first film directed by a woman by Disney, you?",Curious to dive deeper
312," I think I saw an animated film, probably Fantasia? A long time ago. I have heard good things about Frozen.",Neutral
312," That was a while ago, an instant disney classic. Did you know toy companies get involved before they even make movies",Curious to dive deeper
312,The marketing and the licensing are all together on this. The film seems to be a giant commercial for toys! LOL,Neutral
312," For sure, that is a good way to put it! Do you have a favorite animal?",Curious to dive deeper
312,I guess dogs are my favorite. There are so many out there! Elephants are cool too.,Neutral
312,me too I love dogs so much. Elephants and dogs are the only animals that respond to pointing,Curious to dive deeper
312,That makes sense. Elephants have a tremendous intellect. I think they are much smarter than we suspect.,Neutral
312,Did you know there are like 20 quintillion individual animals on this planet,Curious to dive deeper
312,I figure we're killing them at a rate that is going to hurt our chances of survival. That is something we should worry about.,Neutral
312," For sure, it is sad to think that is happening. Hiccups formed i think because of animals ",Curious to dive deeper
312," We probably do not need hiccups now, but there are there from a long time ago. Maybe when we breathed differently.",Neutral
312," That is very true. in 2002 animals were given actual rights in Germany, should happen everywhere",Curious to dive deeper
312,Animals should have someone to advocate for them. Too often animals are left to fend for themselves. I wonder who the lawyers are.,Neutral
312," For sure, humans could do this if they weren't so busy doing other things.",Curious to dive deeper
312," I wish that we had a longer term vision of our place on the planet. We don't. Humans are separate from animals, but not independent. We will follow their fate if we destroy the planet.",Neutral
312," For sure, I will be long gone by then but sad to think it will probably happen. good chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
312,Nice chatting with you too!,Neutral
312,Have a great weekend! BYE,Curious to dive deeper
313,People in Indoenesia do not like crocodiles.  They killed 300 after 1 killed a villager.,Surprised
313," I can see how the crocodiles can be dangerous though. For them, it's about human safety",Neutral
313," I understand, but the guy that was killed was in a protected croc sanctuary. It was kind of his fault.",Curious to dive deeper
313," And I guess the species is endangered, which is part of why it's a big deal",Neutral
313," Yes.  40 cops tried to stop the crowd, but it turned into a mob of 600 villagers.",Fearful
313," Most of the time they try to remove the animals humanely, but those cases are also in the United States. Those villagers likely acted out of fear",Neutral
313," Yes, in some instances animals that attack are required to be put down and tested for disease like rabies",Curious to dive deeper
313," On the other end of the spectrum, animals have guaranteed legal rights in Germany",Neutral
313,That is good.  There is a line between public safety and animal cruelty,Disgusted
313," As long as the public is safe. In Scotland, the Loch Ness monster is a protected species",Neutral
313,That is funny.  Next it will be bigfoot,Happy
313," If Bigfoot is in the US, that one may not happen. Although if he has a white patch on his forehead, it's a sign that he's domesticated",Neutral
313,Apparently humans looked like bigfoot many years ago.  Then about 240 thousand years ago we lost body hair,Curious to dive deeper
313,One thing we didn't lose are hiccups. It's a leftover result of when land animals had both lungs and gills,Neutral
313,That is insane to think how species evolved.  Now that are 20 quintillion different animals on earth,Curious to dive deeper
313," And yet among all those, we are the best distance runners due to persistence during hunting",Neutral
313," Yes, but we have to buy our vitamin C.  Most other animals and plants produce it naturally",Curious to dive deeper
313," True, but I wonder how many other animals can regrow a rib in 2-3 months after it's surgically shortened",Neutral
313,That is true.  And we can use tools.  Let's see a crocodile do that,Curious to dive deeper
313,I wonder if there's a sound frequency that can cause fear in them like there's one that does in humans,Curious to dive deeper
313,Maybe that is why we build fires and make weapons.  To guard against the fear,Neutral
314,Hi do you like animals?,Curious to dive deeper
314,Hi. I love animals. I have a couple of pets. How about you?,Happy
314," I also love animals,  I have a dog,  but Ive been asking my husband for a dragon for years",Surprised
314," I don't think he'll be able to find that. Out of the 20 quintillion animal types on the planet, I don't think dragon's exist.",Neutral
314," well not the ones I want.  But they do exist,  the kimodo dragon. ",Curious to dive deeper
314,Oh that's right. I forgot those little guys are still around. Did you know Germany is the first country in the world to give animals legal rights?,Curious to dive deeper
314," Yeah I think the kimodo dragon actually has its own island too lol I didnt know that,  what rights are those?",Curious to dive deeper
314," Yes, I think the do have an island. As for the legal rights, I'm not entirely sure but pretty much what humans have.",Neutral
314,I see.  Did you know dogs have 12 blood types?,Curious to dive deeper
314," No, I had no idea. That is interesting. Did you know animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated?",Curious to dive deeper
314,Is that every animal?  I never seen it on any of my dogs or fish.  That is interesting.,Curious to dive deeper
314," Yes, my animals have those patches. I think it's all the head pats.",Neutral
314,lol what kind of animals do you have?,Curious to dive deeper
314," I have two cats. They are rescues, really good cats but they seems to hate the movie Frozen. Did you know that was the first Disney film directed by a woman?",Neutral
314," Nice,  my dog is a rescue.  I wonder why they hate frozen,  it has such good songs.  No I didnt know that. ",Curious to dive deeper
314,I don't know but they literally growl at the TV when its on. I guess they aren't Disney fans. I wonder if they would like the lion king.,Curious to dive deeper
314," Yeah show them something they might relate to,  cats.  did you know that wreck it ralph developement started in the 1980s,  took so long to get that movie finish,  turned out great though. ",Curious to dive deeper
314," I had no idea, that is a long time of development. I was also surprised to find out the lion king was the first Disney film to be dubbed in Zulu for its African release.",Curious to dive deeper
314," Thats good,  they should make it dubbed in more languages. ",Curious to dive deeper
314," Yeah, they are trying to sell to a big audience. I mean toy industries are involved with Disney animations before they begin making the films.",Neutral
314," That seems like a given,  these toys come out way before the movie to promote it and get kids excited about the movie.",Curious to dive deeper
314," Well its no surprise. Disney is one of Hollywood's biggest film studios. If they make something, then you should get in while you can.",Neutral
314," Yeah,  its been good talking to you.  ",Curious to dive deeper
315,Is Google your #1 search engine?,Curious to dive deeper
315," Yeah, pretty much. I'm locked into a disturbing amount of their utilities. How about you?",Disgusted
315," I love Google, i can't stand other search engines like bing or yahoo",Curious to dive deeper
315,I refuse to use Bing because I despise Microsoft even more than Google.,Disgusted
315," lol, Google is incredible though, it requires more computing power for one search than it took to send neil armstrong to the moon!",Curious to dive deeper
315," Yeah, pretty much any kind of personal electronic device these days would put the supercomputers of that period to shame.",Neutral
315," that is very true, a lot has come since back then. How about siri, are you a fan?",Curious to dive deeper
315," I don't even have a smart phone, so I've never used it. Have you?",Neutral
315," wow, you are daring, i like it! I have an iphone but never use siri, I would rather just google something instead to be honest.",Curious to dive deeper
315," I'm not really daring, LOL. I just live in a 3G dead zone and I'm self-employed, so I just need a basic tracfone in case I have an emergency on my occasional trips to town. But my laptop is all the Internet connection I need.",Happy
315," I have a friend like that also, no shame in that. That is perfect though with your laptop because you can still communicate with others if needed. Do you do a lot of amazon shopping?",Curious to dive deeper
315," A fair amount, although they're another corporation I hate :) I get better deals on supplements and used books. How about you?",Neutral
315," For sure, it was started as a book company in 1994",Surprised
315," They're a good source of out-of-print stuff, for sure. Library Genesis is also good for obtaining ""unauthorized"" pdfs of a whole lot of books. I always check there before Amazon.",Happy
315," I will have to check that out, is that legal to use? I am taking my masters and books cost too much",Curious to dive deeper
315," The uploads are probably copyright violations, but I've never heard of anybody having trouble over downloading from it. And any academic book you want there's a better than 90% chance you'll find it there. Just Google ""Library Genesis"" to find mirror sites. ",Happy
315," wow, I will do that, thank you! Back to amazon though, jeff bezos has a clock in a mountain that will run for 10,000, i wonder why",Curious to dive deeper
315," It sounds a lot like something called the Long Now Project that did something similar, IIRC.",Curious to dive deeper
315," I will have to look into that, that sounds interesting. I just googled library genesis. It was so nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
315,Likewise. But I don't think we're quite done yet.,Neutral
315," Now we are, enjoy your weekend !",Curious to dive deeper
315,You too!,Happy
316,It looks like Apple is have some problems with its new HomePod product. Do you have one?,Curious to dive deeper
316,No I don't have one. But my parents do have an Amazon Alexa and my brother has a Google home which are similar devices. do you have one by the way?,Curious to dive deeper
316," Apple always overprices their stuff allowing others to offer products that are just as good at a lower price.  Kids and young adults buy them because they are ""cute"" and popular in their little clicks.",Surprised
316," Yep I think so. It's crazy that there have been over four hundred million smart home devices shipped back in 2017 and it is projected to reach almost 1 billion devices by the year 2022 though, so they are definitely going to get more popular over time",Surprised
316,I still feel stupid talking to an inanimate object. Siri wasn't even and Apple development.  It was originally intended for Android but Apple bought it.,Curious to dive deeper
316," Haha that's really weird. I also think it's weird that Apple went for the high-end Market with their homepod, when you can get a Google home for about $100 a homepod goes for almost four hundred, that's definitely a rip off",Surprised
316," Yeah, that's Apple.  They have become more competitive but, face it, like everyone else their stuff is made somewhere in Asia. SO do you use something like Siri or Cortana?",Curious to dive deeper
316," No I just stick to Google myself, I don't know what Google's voice assistant is called but it's not Siri or Cortana, what about you? What do you use",Curious to dive deeper
316,On my phone it's Google like you.  On my laptop it's Cortana by I don't use it much.   I didn't know there was a male Siri -- a British guy?,Curious to dive deeper
316,No I didn't know that either. I only heard the female Siri haha. What do you think about the fact that a Google search uses more computing power than the power it took to send an astronaut to the Moon,Surprised
316,People back then were good with a slide rule!  I think smart people will always be needed and computers will not take over the world.,Surprised
316,Yes I think so. What it is crazy how far technology has come. For instance Google can use Android devices on the roads to map traffic data,Surprised
316,Yeah.  I don't remember Google going down for 5 minutes in 2013.  It took 40% of web traffic with it.  I probably thought it was a problem on my end.,Surprised
316," Wow that's a crazy amount of traffic! And no I don't remember that either, what do you think about the fact that Google Maps changes its Maps based on where you are searching from? That way if there is a dispute on a countries border it will create the border based on the user's location data?",Curious to dive deeper
316,That is interesting... They sure go to a lot of trouble.  Like when they used goats as lawn mowers.  They clearly didn't know how ornery goats are.,Curious to dive deeper
316," Haha that sounds like that would have taken a long time, what do you think about the fact that the CEO of Amazon actually built a clock into a mountain? I don't know why he would do that do you",Curious to dive deeper
316," Yeah, Bezos will do that in lieu of compensating his employees.  He's another one of the lefty liberals that would disappear if you removed the hypocrisy from them.  ",Disgusted
316," LOL I like the way you think. it is crazy though that Amazon owns imdb.com, I use that almost everyday for my movie collection",Surprised
316,I love IMDB and was surprised to learn that.  I also learned that the 1st Amazon customer got a building named after him.,Surprised
316," Yeah that is shocking. And since I don't have an iPhone I wouldn't know this, but apparently if you ask Siri to sing a song then she will sing the song that HAL 9000 sings in 2001 A Space Odyssey which is definitely creepy haha",Surprised
316,That would be a little creepy.  Kubrick did the Hal 9000 thing where it was kind of chilling...  Thanks for the excellent chat!,Surprised
317,hi how are you? do you use amazon?,Neutral
317," Hello I am doing great! I do, a little more than I want to though, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
317," I sometimes use it, when i dont have time to shop. i like to check things out in the store, if possible.",Neutral
317,It's sad but I have turned into the complete opposite! I only go to the store if it's not on amazon haha. I wish I was the first customer to buy something though!,Curious to dive deeper
317,I would rather have amazon prime for life than a building named after me.,Neutral
317,Haha I would like that as well haha. Can you believe how many miles a day an Amazon worker walks a day?,Curious to dive deeper
317," I think that they must lose a lot of weight, or get really bad knees LOL",Neutral
317,I bet! I didn't even know IMDB was owned by Amazon too. They have the hand in every cookie jar haha.,Curious to dive deeper
317," Yeah, soon amazon will own everything and we will all work at amazon. 15 miles a day. can i do that at my age? LOL",Neutral
317,I'm only 30 and am dreading that just thinking about it lol. Maybe Google will try and stop them?,Surprised
317,Google and amazon will merge. all searches will produce amazon results. you will use your wages from google or amazon to buy goods online from amazon.,Neutral
317,It's like the movie terminator! SKYNET IS OUT TO GET US!!!! haha it really is crazy how much stake Google has in the internet.,Surprised
317," google dominates, but there is always some upstart that unseats the dominant firm. i wonder who that will be.",Neutral
317," Well Google falls under Alphabet now, so I feel like they are getting prepared for that!",Curious to dive deeper
317," Yes, from A to Z, they will control everything. oh, well. i for one hail our new corporate overlords.",Neutral
317,Apple even has a big piece of everything. Do you have an iPhone and use Siri?,Surprised
317,I dont have an iphone. too expensive. i really dont want an electronic pacifier in my pocket LOL,Neutral
317,haha I have the iPhone SE which came out like 5 years ago haha. I hardly ever use Siri but people love her!,Surprised
317,Siri is probably convenient but isnt it always listening to you? i dont want that kind of eavesdropping.,Neutral
317,I'm sure it is. Apple must have a lot of boring data on me haha.,Curious to dive deeper
317," Yeah, me too, and i dont even use Apple. LOL anyway, great chat!",Neutral
317,Thanks you as well. Have a good night!,Curious to dive deeper
318,hi how are you? do you like to dance?,Neutral
318,I like to watch it. I know Bruce Lee was a great dancer and he won the Hong Kong Cha Cha Championship in 1958.,Happy
318,i cant say that im surprised. he must have had a great sense of rhythm. i bet he was a real ladies' man.,Neutral
318," Yeah, I bet. Did you know ballet dancers can go through four pairs of pointe shoes in a week.",Happy
318," if i were a dancer, i would go through a dozen. LOL. i cannot dance. really.",Neutral
318,Me too! Did you know Michael Jackson has a patent?,Happy
318,is that the patent on the shoes for that special lean? he really was a genius.,Neutral
318,It was a device used to achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves.,Happy
318," yeah, thats it! i was never any good at dancing. i wonder if you have to start when youre young.",Neutral
318," Well, I know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. Maybe the better dancers heard a lot of music when they were younger.",Happy
318,i wonder if i heard enough music. maybe that was it. maybe i missed by window. oh well.,Neutral
318," Yeah, maybe. I know they smile more when they hit the bet.",Happy
318,I use smile when i hit a bet too. LOL i heard that tupac was a dancer back in high school.,Neutral
318," Yeah, I think he danced in the Nutcracker in HS.",Happy
318," I bet he was really good too. he was a backup dancer for digital underground later on. by the way, are you a fan of snakes?",Neutral
318,No. I'm not crazy about snakes. There's no snakes in New Zealand.,Happy
318,so ive heard. i guess i would move there if i had a phobia of snakes. i have never seen a flying snake. that would be frightening.,Neutral
318," No, basically they;re legless lizards without limbs.",Happy
318," oh, ok. The fear of snakes is hard-wired  in human brains. i guess that makes sense. we needed it for evolution.",Neutral
318," Yeah, can you believe that crocodiles are more closely related to birds than to snakes.",Happy
318," i guess scales and feathers are analogous? i never know they were related. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
318," Yeah, good talking with you too!",Surprised
319," Hi! Are you familiar with Bad Times at the El Royale? I feel it basically defies expectations even though not all of its surprises are pleasant but there is satisfaction, however!",Neutral
319," hi how are you? I have heard of it. it is a movie that came out recently, right?",Neutral
319," Not too long ago and it's basically set in 1969 and is also kind of a B movie, black comedy and mystery! Drew Goddard directed it as well!",Neutral
319,A B movie? Great! that sounds fun. low budget? doesnt take itself too seriously?,Neutral
319," Exactly. So are you a horror fan in general? I watch horror films as a workout because you can burn over 180 calories just by watching them, surprisingly enough!",Neutral
319," I thnk the first time it would burn that many, but the second time maybe not. not so scary. ",Neutral
319," That is a good point. But you know what else is crazy, they say if you view abstract art after watching a horror film, you'll enjoy it a lot more! I need to try that!",Surprised
319,How does that even work? is your brain more active? more emotionally sensitive?,Neutral
319," I would imagine so. It's so weird, isn't it? I tell you what else is weird, Stephen King once said Bambi was the first horror movie he watched. Can you believe that? He definitely has a twisted mind, doesn't he?",Surprised
319,He probably was traumatized by that disney flick and ended up fascinated with the macabre.,Neutral
319,Agreed! You know what else gets me? Danny from The Shining didn't actually know he was acting in a horror movie until years later. It's like how did he not know?,Surprised
319,I guess he was ....slow? i dont know. what kind of movie did he imagine it to be?,Neutral
319," That's what I'm wondering. Ha! But enough of this horror talk, or else I'm going to get scared. Ha! Are you a fantasy fan at all? I'd like to join the national spelling bee fantasy draft one of these days!",Neutral
319,I have never down fantasy sports. I guess the appeal is that you compete and can make some money?,Neutral
319,I guess so! But I also think it's cool that a single fold in our brains basically separate how we perceive reality and fantasy. That's truly amazing!,Neutral
319,I wonder if my fold has come unfolded in recent years. i feel that my time on the internet has blurred the line.,Neutral
319," Ha! I know what you mean. It is hard to distinguish at times, isn't it? Maybe we should start writing fantasy. Then hopefully we can be knighted for our services to literature like author Terry Pratchett was!",Neutral
319,Terry is a great writer. He deserves the recognition. do we have to call him sir terry though?,Neutral
319," I suppose he's earned that title. Ha! On a similar fantasy note  (if you would consider this movie fantasy like I kind of do), do you like Thor? I think it's crazy Ant Man of all characters made his Marvel debut before Thor and even Hulk, Iron Man and Spider Man! Isn't that unbelievable?",Surprised
319," I havent seen thor. I guess it could be good. i like the norse myths. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
319," It's a great movie! Marvel Studios produced it and Paramount distributed it. Plus it was directed by Kenneth Branagh and written by both Zack Stentz and Ashley Edward Miller! Well, it was great chatting with you as well! Hope you have a good night, friend!",Neutral
319," Yes, i enjoyed chatting too! Have a good weekend!",Neutral
319," And same to you! Be sure to check out Thor this weekend. If you like Anthony Hopkins, Idris Elba, Natalie Portman or Chris Hemsworth, then this is the movie for you! Ha! Take care, friend!",Neutral
320,Good morning! As someone who suffers from ophiophobia. I am pleased to learn there are no snakes in New Zealand.,Happy
320,I hate snakes.,Neutral
320,Did you know that there is even a flying snake?,Curious to dive deeper
320," No I did not.  But crocodiles, which I also hate, are related more to birds than snakes. ",Surprised
320," I like the crocs, and I guess monkey's share our fear of snakes.",Surprised
320," They must be smart, lol.  What about the legless lizards.  They look like snakes ",Surprised
320," I don't like those either, nor eels. I do think it's fascinating that they have their paired organs one in front of another, opposed to side-by-side.",Curious to dive deeper
320," That is fascinating.  I also think that the fact that In Britain, politicians had tomwear a top hat if making a point of order in the house of commons until 1998.",Surprised
320," That's insane. Kinda like people thinking that in the old west, the bowler was most popular, not the cowboy hat.",Surprised
320," Oh really, neat.  When someone tips their hat to you, it originated from knights lifting their face visors to show friendliness.",Curious to dive deeper
320," I did know that! It was explained to us at Medieval Times. Yet, the length of ladies hatpins were regulated, so they could not be used as a weapon.",Curious to dive deeper
320,That sounds reasonable.  Some hats even have religious fuct,Neutral
320,Do you know what the function of the turban worn by Sikhs is?,Curious to dive deeper
320," No but I know it's a religious thing, just like mitres worn by Bishops.",Neutral
320," The chef's Toque is just silly, it gets in the way and looks like a coffee filter.",Happy
320," lol, yes it does.  Do you like to Dance?  Did you know that Bruce Lee was actually a great dancer.  He won the Hong Kong cha cha championship in 1958.",Surprised
320,I don't dance. I am not cordinated at all. I like watching people dance. I think its cute how babies break out in dance when they hear music.,Happy
320,That is adorable.  My wife has a degree in dance.  She told me that professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pair of pointe shoes in a week.,Surprised
320," I think it's fascinating that Michael Jackson's shoes were responsible for that extreme lean in his dance moves, I always thought he wore disguised pointe shoes.",Curious to dive deeper
320,I also saw he has a patent on the device used for that lean.,Surprised
320,That is insane. Almost as crazy as Tupac being a ballet dancer in high school.,Surprised
320," Well, have a great day.",Neutral
321,Are you a fan of horror films?,Curious to dive deeper
321,I am a definite no on that!,Surprised
321," I'm not either to be honest. What about Fantasy films, do you watch them? ",Curious to dive deeper
321,I'll take back a bit. I like Edgar Allen Poe. I know watching horror movies can burn up to 180 calories!,Happy
321," Interesting. So instead of going to the gym, you just sit there and watch the movies? ",Curious to dive deeper
321,Right! Did you know Bambi terrified Stephen King.,Surprised
321," I'm not surprised, Bambi does die in the end. ",Curious to dive deeper
321,I'm glad. I know if you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art you will enjoy the art more.,Surprised
321," Interesting, any type of specific artists, or just abstract art? ",Curious to dive deeper
321,I think just abstract art.,Neutral
321," Ok, I wonder why that is. Any ideas as to why this occurs? ",Curious to dive deeper
321,None at all. It's hard to believe Danny the boy from the shining did not know he was acting in horror film.,Curious to dive deeper
321,Interesting. I didn't know that. Did you know that they have fantasy draft spelling bees?,Curious to dive deeper
321," No, I did not. A single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy. ",Surprised
321," Interesting, I didn't realize that. Have you heard of the fantasy called ""In the Realms of the Unreal?""",Curious to dive deeper
321," No, what is it about?",Curious to dive deeper
321," It's apparently a fantasy, but I'm not sure what it is about. ",Curious to dive deeper
321," Oh, okay. I know fantasy has evolved into various media including film, TV, graphic novels and more!",Surprised
321," Wow! That is really cool. What about Thor, have you seen it? ",Curious to dive deeper
321,I have heard of Thor. I know it is a 2011 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics character of the same name.,Curious to dive deeper
321," Yeah, it is pretty good. I saw the first one and kind of liked it. ",Curious to dive deeper
322,Did you happen to see Bad Times at the El Royale?,Curious to dive deeper
322," I did, and I thought it was much better than what I expected, what about you?",Happy
322,I went to the theater. I know it did not do well in the theater and that's too bad. It was good and I'm a big fan of Drew Goddard and Jeff Bridges.,Curious to dive deeper
322," I liked Cynthias performance I thought she was pretty good, I liked that each had a different skeleton and hidden problems",Curious to dive deeper
322,Yes she was amazing. I liked the intrigue and mystery as well. Drew Goddard also did Cabin in the Woods. Are you a fan of horror movies?,Curious to dive deeper
322," I am a fan of horro movies, what about you? do you like them?",Happy
322,I love them. Did you know that watching horror movies burns over 180 calories?,Neutral
322," I didnt, I guess Im going to watch a few this weekend lol, do you know who Stephen King is?",Curious to dive deeper
322,I love Stephen King. My book shelf that just hold his works is literally bowing from the weight.,Happy
322,Well aparently he was afraid of Bambi and that was the first horror movie he ever watched.,Surprised
322," I can see that being very upsetting. Old Disney movies are brutal. Speaking of King, the boy who played Danny in The Shining was not aware they were filming a horror movie. ",Neutral
322," I wonder how that worked lol, it was a really scary movie, probably best if they tricked him.",Surprised
322,I totally agree. It's intense. Have you ever heard of an instrument called a waterphone?,Curious to dive deeper
322," I havent heard of that instrument, I wonder how its used or its applications!",Curious to dive deeper
322,It's actually used to make the creepy metallic noises you hear in horror movies. I always wondered what made that sound.,Curious to dive deeper
322," Oh I see, I wonder how it sounds like thoug, do you like fantasy?",Curious to dive deeper
322,I like some fantasy. I like Terry Pratchett who was knighted for his works and he certainly deserved that honor.,Happy
322," He was knighted because of his apportations to literature right? Im more of a Superhero fan, I guess that counts as fantasy as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
322,That is correct. I can see that counting. I think fantasy drafting has become out of control. People have fantasy drafts for the national spelling bee now!,Surprised
322,Thats crazy lol I heard about congress fantasy but spelling bee fantasy?!! thats just weird,Surprised
322,It has definitely gone way too far.,Surprised
323,Isn't it amazing that British politicians were forced by law to wear a top hat.,Surprised
323,I wonder what the story is on that. I'm going to look up bowler hat,Surprised
323,The bowler hats were extremely popular in the old west.,Neutral
323,I looked at a picture of bowler hat. I think I like cowboy hat better. Or those Mexican hats. Those are cool,Neutral
323," They do look very similar to the cowboy hats, no wonder they were so popular.",Neutral
323,They are cute but maybe that's why I don't like them. I don't see kippa mentioned,Neutral
323,I like to wear hate. I tip my hat to greet people when I'm wearing one.,Neutral
323,I don't like to wear a hat unless it's to keep the sun out of my face,Neutral
323,Are you afraid of snakes?,Curious to dive deeper
323," No, I think they are kind of cool. We have a snake man around here who visits jails and hospitals with his snakes. The kids love it",Neutral
323," That's surprising. Like most people and other primates, I'm so afraid of snakes.",Neutral
323,oh ya I saw this cat video where people had a cucumber and the cat thinks it's a snake and freaks out,Surprised
323,I guess chats are scared of snakes too then. There are places in the world where there are no snakes at all.,Neutral
323," I meant to write Reptile man, not snake man. He has a webpage",Neutral
323,I think snakes are reptile. Snakes are different from lizards though.,Neutral
323," I'm going to look up ""legless lizard""",Neutral
323," I've seen those before, they look like snakes, but they're not snakes.",Neutral
323," wow, interesting! My daughter works for a veterinarian that sees pretty much any kind of animal",Neutral
323," There are so many types of snakes, I'm sure she has seen all of them including flying snakes!",Surprised
323,I should ask her. People have all kinds of pets like turtles and spiders,Neutral
323,I just have a dog as my pet.,Neutral
324," Hey hows it going, do you like fantasy or horror films the most?",Curious to dive deeper
324,horror is the best. I love Edgar Allan Poe,Happy
324," The Raven is such a great book. I like both, I get scared easily at horror movies though but do with fantasy, they are both great though.",Curious to dive deeper
324," I did not know that scream was going to be titled ""scary movie"".",Surprised
324," Yah, what are those called, dark comedies right? ",Curious to dive deeper
324,yes. The actors in the exorcist never knew that they were making a horror film. lol,Surprised
324," It's crazy, I think a lot of people are like that in real life too, I wish more people would realize that it could be us like that. Isn't it nuts that a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy? ",Curious to dive deeper
324,Thats deep. People could learn more about this at an actual university,Curious to dive deeper
324," They could, too bad not everyone has access to a university though, would help everyone out a lot if it was more profitable, the inequality gap in the US is getting ridiculous!",Curious to dive deeper
324,Did you ever see Thor that came out in 2011 ?,Curious to dive deeper
324," I did, I remember watching it in the movie theater, it's the fourth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Loki seems like a bad guy you can root for, or am I mistaken?",Curious to dive deeper
324,I have never seen it. I do like Chris Hemsworth,Neutral
324," Yah he is a good actor, I like Natallie Portman and Tom HIddleston too, both great actors and actresses!",Surprised
324,I agree but Idris Elba and Anthony Hopkins are the best,Happy
324," Idris Elba is a great actor, did you see The Wire at all?",Curious to dive deeper
324,one of the best shows ever. So Jim henson created 'the dark crystal' ? I did not know that,Neutral
324," I did not know that, Jim Henson created Seasame Street right?",Surprised
324," yes i grew up on that. I would love to see that 15,145-page fantasy manuscript ",Curious to dive deeper
324,Or what about a fantasy draft for the national spelling bee? That's nuts people do that too. I wonder what Seasame Street would be like as a horror or fantasy show?,Curious to dive deeper
324," lol good question. the lord of the rings won an academy award for ""best picture"" Good movie !",Happy
324," I'm sure it was a good movie, I really can't get into that type of fantasy movies, same with Game of Thrones, I know they are great pieces of art and so good, I just don't really like watching them, there is a lot of good take aways from the movies though about how the world should be. Terry Pratchett was knighted for his services to literature, and he's a comedic fantasy author.",Curious to dive deeper
324,Very good point. I love all Fantasy movies in both literature and drama. enjoy your fantasy movies !,Happy
325," Hey! Did you know that until 1998, British politicians had to wear a top hat when making a point of order in the house of commons?",Surprised
325," I did not know that, but it could be because hats are worn for various reasons which include ceremonial ones, like the house of commons!",Happy
325," Exactly. The most popular hat in the Old West was actually the bowler, not the Cowboy hat.",Surprised
325," So you are saying that all of the westerns have got it wrong? Haha, all of the cowboys should have been wearing bowler hats, doesn't make them seem quite as tough. ",Curious to dive deeper
325," I guess so! I was surprised when I learned that. Imagine the Marlboro cowboy in a bowler! That wouldn't work though, because a cowboy really does need a cowboy hat to protect against the sun and rain.",Curious to dive deeper
325," I agree, it is just not the same. You know how cowboys would tip their hats in greeting? That originated from knights raising their face visors to show they were friendly. ",Curious to dive deeper
325," That's very interesting and makes sense. How do you feel about snakes? I'm not a big fan. I'd go to New Zealand, where there are none.",Surprised
325," I would be joining you in New Zealand. Snakes make my skin crawl, always have. It is a long held fear of mine. New Zealand is lucky!",Fearful
325,Yeah that's how I feel too! There is a genus of flying snakes that can launch themselves. If I saw that in person I would die.,Surprised
325," I would as well, it is bad enough to see them slither around, but flying...no! I was reading that the fear of snakes is hard-wired not just in human brains, but in monkey brains as well. ",Fearful
325," Well humans and monkeys are distantly related lol. There are legless lizards also. I don't mind legged lizards, but I don't think I would look at a legless lizard as anything less than a snake.",Surprised
325," If it doesn't have legs, I am checking out. A legless lizard is a snake! You know, I was reading that crocodiles are closer related to birds then snakes and lizards. I would have never guessed that. ",Curious to dive deeper
325," Haha checking out. Agreed. I wouldn't have guessed that about crocodiles either. I always call alligators/crocodiles dinosaurs, and I heard that chickens are likely descendants of dinosaurs.. so maybe I am onto something? ",Curious to dive deeper
325," If you have seen Jurassic park and believe it (I kinda do) then you would agree. Hey, do you like dancing? Did you know that it can be categorized and described by its choreography. I am horrible, but its fun. ",Surprised
325,I love Jurassic Park and I do love dancing. I'm not the best dancer either but I have a good time. Apparently Bruce Lee was a great dancer and won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship in 1958.,Surprised
325,I bet that is why he was so good at martial arts. Dancing probably helped keep him limber and light on his feet. I feel like those would be important skills to have.,Happy
325," Good point! Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music and smile more when they hit the beat! I can attest to that, I have one at home and he loves music.",Happy
325," That is adorable, baby dancing is the best, it is so pure for the joy of it! You know who else was a dancer? Tupac, he danced ballet. That is unexpected. ",Happy
325,Whoa I didn't know that and I'm a Tupac fan. Very unexpected! Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week. I know he wasn't wearing those though.,Surprised
325," No, can you imagine him performing California Love wearing point shoes and doing ballet? It would be funny, but probably ruin the effect of the song. ",Curious to dive deeper
325,Hahahaha very true. Well I thoroughly enjoyed this chat! Have a wonderful day/night!,Happy
325," Same to you, take care!!!",Happy
325,You as well.,Neutral
326,Hi do you like DIsney?,Curious to dive deeper
326,Yeah I do. Do you know what the real name of Minnie is?,Curious to dive deeper
326,Yes her name is Minerva but I like Minnie better,Curious to dive deeper
326,Yeah me too. Have you heard about the culture of hidden mickey mouse?,Curious to dive deeper
326,Yeah they hide stuff on everything disney for people to find,Curious to dive deeper
326,Yeah pretty cool. Do you know who Bill Nye is?,Curious to dive deeper
326,Yeah the is the science guy and he worked with disney for the Flubber movies,Curious to dive deeper
326,Yeah he is in a lot of things now. Do you like the Pixar studio movies?,Curious to dive deeper
326," I love them especially wall-e, have you seen it?",Curious to dive deeper
326,I have and loved it. Do you know who it is a tip of the hat to?,Curious to dive deeper
326," Yes to Walter Elias Disney, which is very fitting as he started the whole thing",Curious to dive deeper
326,Yeah it is fitting indeed. DO you use google a lot?,Curious to dive deeper
326," Yes I do, is the got to search engine for me. Do you know when it was founded?",Curious to dive deeper
326,Yes in 1998 so it has been around for a while now and I am glad for it,Curious to dive deeper
326,Me too. DO you know how they calculate traffic?,Curious to dive deeper
326,Yes they actually take the average of how fast android devices are moving,Curious to dive deeper
326,Yes. They once hired goats to mow their lawn instead of people,Curious to dive deeper
326," Yeah that is pretty neat, everyone benefited there",Curious to dive deeper
326,Exactly. A single google search uses more computing power than it took to sen 12 astronauts to the moon,Curious to dive deeper
326,That is insane indeed. It once went down for 5 minutes and took 40% of traffic with it,Curious to dive deeper
326," No wonder they are this big, so many people are using them",Happy
327,Hello there hope you're doing well. Do you like the fantasy genre? I like it because it's roots are in oral traditions.,Curious to dive deeper
327,I like fantasy drafts. Lol,Happy
327,Yeah fantasy drafts are fun- and even fantasy drafts are done for the national spelling bee!,Surprised
327,I haven't ever done that. There is also a draft for congress.,Happy
327,Type of people participate in these things? I think it would be boring. A single fold in the brain makes a difference between perceiving reality and fantasy.,Surprised
327,Have you ever heard of terry pratchett,Happy
327,Yeah I think so I can't believe he was knighted for services to literature. He must have made some great contributions.,Surprised
327,He really has. What an honor as well.,Happy
327,Yeah he must've been so proud. There was once a janitor from Chicago who wrote over six years of fantasy manuscript. He must've really been into it.,Curious to dive deeper
327,Yeah that is a long time to write something. He must have been really devoted.,Happy
327,Agreed. I bet he would've love to work for Disney. Bill Nye actually work for Disney as a consultant for Disney's flubber.,Surprised
327,really. Thats cool. I always liked bill nye,Happy
327,Yeah he seems like a good guy. The Disney character Minnie mouse's name is short for Minerva mouse.,Surprised
327,I heard that actually.,Happy
327,Yeah I think it's interesting I never knew it. There's a whole subculture dedicated to finding hidden Mickey mouse images in all things Disney. I didn't know they hid things.,Surprised
327,You would think they would have better stuff to do.,Happy
327," Yeah some people have too much time on their hands. Disney's big hero six was rendered using a 55,000 core super computer. Wow.",Curious to dive deeper
327,Have you ever seen Wall-E,Happy
327," Nope I have never seen that movie, is it good? It looks like Pixar honored Walter Elias Disney in the name.",Surprised
327,Yeap they sure did.,Happy
327,I love having Google because I can look up anything I don't know. A single search requires a ton of computing power.,Happy
328,Have you ever read a wrinkle in time?,Curious to dive deeper
328,I have not. What is it about?,Curious to dive deeper
328,It is a fantasy where the main hero is a little girl. Apparently publishers were not a fan when it was first being sent out for publication.,Sad
328,Interesting. There is a university where you can study science fiction and fantasy literature with a concentration in Tolkien studies.,Surprised
328,That would be an amazing class! I think there is so much to be learned from those great books.,Curious to dive deeper
328,I think so too. Jim Henson created The Dark Crystal with the idea that it was unhealthy for children never to be afraid.,Surprised
328,Hmm I could see that being true. If children have no fear then they are liable to get into anything. Healthy fear isn't a bad thing.,Surprised
328,I agree. Do you like Walt Disney?,Curious to dive deeper
328,I like some of their stuff. A few things are a bit underhandedly political for my taste but most is good. You?,Curious to dive deeper
328," Yep, I like Walt Disney. The Disney channel doesn't accept outside ads. Did you know that?",Surprised
328,I didn't know that. Makes sense though because then they can direct traffic toward their products and shows.,Disgusted
328,Yep I agree. Walt Disney and Salvador Dali once collaborated on a short film.,Surprised
328,That is awesome. i think my favorie disney film would have to be either big hero 6 or the incredibles.,Happy
328," Yea those are both good ones. Disney makes $1,110 per second.",Surprised
328,Wow that is just a insane amount of money. Hopefully they are doing some good work with all that cash.,Surprised
328,I bet they are. Walt Disney was fired from his job at a local newspaper for not being creative enough.,Surprised
328,That seems very strange but I guess the times where different on what people considered entertainment.,Sad
328,Do you use Google?,Curious to dive deeper
328,I do use it quite a bit. Gmail is great. Do you like it?,Curious to dive deeper
328,I love Google. I pretty much use it daily.,Happy
328,I think they are probably the most used site ever. Look at what happened back in 2013 when it went down for 5 minutes. Internet use dropped 40%!,Surprised
328,It was good talking to you.,Happy
329," A Wrinkle in Time was a great film with an interesting cast, what are your thoughts?",Curious to dive deeper
329," Well, good morning.  I actually have never seen that movie, have you?",Curious to dive deeper
329," I have, its actually pretty good, you should watch it, Oprah  Winfrey is a part of the cast",Curious to dive deeper
329," Well, anything with Ms. O in it is probably pretty good.  I'll give it a look when I get a chance.",Curious to dive deeper
329," You should, I think it was also a book, well best movies come out of great books",Curious to dive deeper
329," Yes, they do. Do you watch Disney Channel?",Curious to dive deeper
329," I do like the Disney Channel yeah, why do you ask?",Curious to dive deeper
329,Do you know they don't accept outside ads.  The only commercials it airs are for its own shows and Disney products?,Curious to dive deeper
329," It seems like they are loosing a lot of money there, did you watch the movie Big Hero 6?",Curious to dive deeper
329," I don't think so.  Yes, I loved Big Hero 6, so did my kids.  Speaking of Disney, did you know Walt Disney was fired from his job at a local newspaper for not being creative enough?",Surprised
329," Well the movie Big Hero 6 was made with a 55000 core super computer, amazing right? and he was fired wow, that is funny and ironic",Happy
329," Amazing, what a computer that was.  Did you know that Walt Disney and Salvadore Dali collaborated on a short film?",Curious to dive deeper
329," I didnt, no, I might have to Google that later, do you know Bill Nye the science guy?",Curious to dive deeper
329," Yes, I've watched him many times on tv.",Curious to dive deeper
329," And what about the movie Flubber, do you remember that movie?",Curious to dive deeper
329," Yes, I do. Old version and the newer one.",Curious to dive deeper
329," I didnt know there was a new version, anyway, he is the science consultant in the old version of the movie",Curious to dive deeper
329," That's cool! Here's a fun fact for you, type the word, askew into Google and watch the page tilt.",Curious to dive deeper
329,I just did it and nothing happened maybe they fixed that issue already.,Curious to dive deeper
329," Maybe so! Do you know new Google employees are called ""nooglers""?",Curious to dive deeper
329," That seems kind of messed up, I think the beanies are funny, the ones the make the nooglers wear.",Curious to dive deeper
330,"  Hello,  did you know that more than 80% of the earths forests have been destroyed?",Sad
330,That is sad. I hope we can reverse that  statistic.,Surprised
330,Yeah that is really sad.  I recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century.,Curious to dive deeper
330," I also think it is interesting that when earth was formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long. I wonder why that changed?",Surprised
330," I don't know,  maybe it slowed its rotation eventually?  That's pretty weird.  ",Curious to dive deeper
330,Do you believe in aliens? The UN appointed ambassadors to extraterrestrials.,Curious to dive deeper
330," Yes,  definitely.  Thats cool lol at least they are prepared!  Do you believe in aliens?",Curious to dive deeper
330,I am not sure. I feel like there is more life out there. I wonder if they will make contact with earth?,Surprised
330," Im assuming so,  otherwise what would the ambassador have to study?  lol how else can he be prepared if theres no evidence?",Curious to dive deeper
330,I am not sure. Do you have any pets?,Surprised
330," Yup,  I have a dog.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
330,I have a cat. Did you know that there are cat cafes in japan and taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks!,Surprised
330," lol yeah,  theres all sorts of cafes like that,  Ive been to a meerkat cafe,  a bird cafe and a raccoon cafe before. ",Curious to dive deeper
330,That is really interesting. I would like that. I wish i slept as much as cats. When a cat reaches 15 years old it has usually spent 10 years of its life sleeping.,Surprised
330,Thats a lot of sleeping!  Theres is a cat named stubbs in alaska that is a mayor lol,Curious to dive deeper
330,I love that. It has been the mayor since 1997.,Happy
330,lol I wonder how they decided that or what his duties are lol,Curious to dive deeper
330,I wonder if he is a stray. The cat in the godfather 1 opening scene was a stray that was found on set.,Happy
330," Wow,  I hope that cat got paid,  thats a very popular movie!",Curious to dive deeper
330,I hope he was adopted after.,Surprised
330,lol yeah.  Its been fun chatting!,Neutral
331," As libraries close, I wonder if it is still true there are more libraries than mcdonalds.What do you think?",Curious to dive deeper
331," I think its possible, They are very useful for everyone. The sacramento library even has a library of things",Surprised
331,A prisoner used the library resources to become a lawyer.,Curious to dive deeper
331,I know! it was a really good use of resources. He proved his innocence and now helps others do the same,Surprised
331," That's amazing. There are all kinds of old stats and info to discover, too.",Happy
331,Yeah you can get unrestricted access to information in many different formats,Neutral
331,Appling was busted on an old baseball story because researchers contradicted his claim.,Curious to dive deeper
331,I heard he was really good at fouling pitches. Including 14 straight.,Surprised
331,It would be great to see a new interview with him but he passed away in 1991.,Curious to dive deeper
331,Yeah I would like to hear his opinion on Belt's 21 pitch at bat,Curious to dive deeper
331,I wonder if he would change when presented with the Yankees stats.,Curious to dive deeper
331,He had a good time playing against Red Ruffing. He liked messing with him,Surprised
331,It sounds like Appling used that strategy a lot.,Neutral
331,Unfortunately we dont have enough stat going back far enough since at bats and pitch by pitch only started getting record in 1988,Sad
331," He bragged about fouling out players,",Neutral
331,Do you think Brandon Belt could do the same,Curious to dive deeper
331,He used the same strategy to run out 12 minutes 45 seconds of gametime.,Curious to dive deeper
331,Thats a long time in baseball. 16 fouls,Surprised
331,It is the longest at-bat since they kept stats on that.,Surprised
331,Did you know baseball managers wear uniforms because they can technically play for their team?,Surprised
331,So they're ready to go on the field and sub in?,Surprised
331,I believe so! That would be something to see!,Surprised
332," hey did you know that when I cat gets to be 15 years old, it has on average slept for about 10 years, so 2/3 of its lifespan",Surprised
332,That doesn't surprise me actually.  i saw something funny the other day that in Japan that have what is called Cat Cafe's where people pay hourly to play with cats,Surprised
332," ha that is crazy, I just got back from a pet store and held a dog actually, I'm not much of a cat person, are you?",Curious to dive deeper
332," No, I'm not but was reading an article where the town of Talkeetna, AL has had a cat named Stubbs as it's mayor since 1997",Surprised
332," that is funny, I like the movie the Godfather a lot, apparently the cat used in the beginning scenes was found on the set and was actually a stray",Curious to dive deeper
332,What about birds. do you like them?  I think hummingbirds are amazing.  They steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nest,Curious to dive deeper
332," haha that is funny, I do like birds, I think it would be scary to be in Austrailia and birds there can mimic different sounds, like you're walking along and think someone is chasing you with a chainsaw, but it's just a bird making that sound haha",Happy
332,wow that would be scary!  I saw that the famously discint do do bird is actually a sub-family of pigeon,Curious to dive deeper
332," that is wild, I know people hunted the dodo because they were eating them, so I guess if we want to know what they tasted like we could try pigeon haha",Curious to dive deeper
332,this is interesting.  In most birds the bones are so hollow that their entire skeleton weighs less than their feathers,Curious to dive deeper
332," that is wild, I think it's crazy that there are birds that fly the distance of Alaska to Mexico without sleeping, thats a lot of endurance!",Curious to dive deeper
332,I saw that human activity threatens about 1200 bird species with extinction,Curious to dive deeper
332," ya that is sad, we are using up earth's resources, and I know that by the end of the 21st century we will have run out of helium which is very important for manufacturing",Curious to dive deeper
332,Wow that is crazy.  more than 80 percent of the earths natural forest have already been destroyed,Curious to dive deeper
332," ya that is sad, what's really crazy is how quickly this is happening, so far humans would only represent about a minute if you consider the entire history of earth to be 24 hours long",Curious to dive deeper
332,Ok so this is totally of subject but the united nations appointedd official ambassadors to extraterrestrials,Surprised
332," haha I wonder how they appointed that guy, like he essentially knows that he will never have to work, like what does that guy do all day? I want his job haha",Happy
332,Exactly that is so funny!  Did you that over 7.6 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival,Surprised
332," I didn't that's a ton of people, I wonder if an alien would be overwhelmed at the number of people on earth, like they would have to wonder how big of a planet this is and how it supports so much life",Curious to dive deeper
332,Good question.  I read that the earth is the densest planet in the solar system and largest of the four terrestrial planets,Curious to dive deeper
332," I could see that, what I really want is for scientists to find alien life in my lifetime though, we need to go back to the moon! haha",Happy
333," hi, do you know much about planet earth?",Curious to dive deeper
333,I know that 80 percent of our forests have already been destroyed,Sad
333,yeah and that is so sad. did you know the day used to be 5.5 hours only ?,Curious to dive deeper
333,It is really sad considering that humans have only been here a minute if earth's history was viewed as a 24 hour period. I did not know that about the day being so short,Surprised
333,Yeah when you think about it it makes it ever sadder to what we are doing to this planet,Curious to dive deeper
333," Well, the UN has appointed an official ambassador to extraterrestrials so hopefully we make some alien friends soon so we can move planets. ",Surprised
333," haha, that would be kind of cool. apparently earth will be helium free by the end of this century",Curious to dive deeper
333,No more helium balloons? Aww...,Sad
333," I know, but maybe it is for the better. do you like animals",Curious to dive deeper
333,I don't really like them as pets but in nature yes. It's sad that the dodo bird is extinct. I hope we stop destroying the earth and habitats for animals. The dodo bird was actually a sub family of pigeon.,Sad
333,Yeah and I think it was a nice looking bird. I hope so too. their bones are lighter than their feathers,Curious to dive deeper
333," Yeah, this is due to their bones being hollow.",Surprised
333," yeah, I guess that makes sense for them since they need to fly",Curious to dive deeper
333," Right. I think wild birds in Australia are neat but would probably drive me insane. They can mimic camera, car alarms, and chainsaw sounds.",Surprised
333," hahaha I can imagine that, going out everytime to check if the car is alright",Curious to dive deeper
333,Another neat thing to observe would be a hummingbird stealing a spiderweb's nest!,Surprised
333,they are so tiny and yet so smart,Curious to dive deeper
333," Sorry, I meant stealing webs to repair their nests. Yeah, bird brains are tiny but they seem so intelligent!",Surprised
333,That is true. How do you feel about cats?,Curious to dive deeper
333,I do not really like them but there is a stray cat that is super sweet and cuddles with me even though I tell her no. It is pretty cute. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
333,I like cats too. there are cafes of them in japan,Curious to dive deeper
333,Nice! I would love to be a cat. They spend a lot of time sleeping.,Happy
334,Hello! How are you this morning?,Curious to dive deeper
334,im doing well! sipping on my morning coffee. how about you?,Neutral
334,Same here! Enjoy that! Also enjoy helium because it's running out lol.,Curious to dive deeper
334,it is??? no way! what are we going to fill out balloons with?,Surprised
334,I'm more worried about making funny voices lol. We are running out of so many things on this earth. Did you know 80 percent of forests have been destroyed?,Curious to dive deeper
334," thats a sad thing to hear. but we still have a bunch, so imagine how many we used to have!",Surprised
334,I couldn't imagine! I wonder if that's why some birds fly from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping?,Curious to dive deeper
334," they have to get to the warm, and fast! they must get tired making the long journey tho",Surprised
334," I'm sure they sleep for days haha. Birds are pretty smart. There are wilds birds in Australia that can mimic the sound of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws.",Curious to dive deeper
334,That's so funny. I wonder what their accents are like. Because birds have accents!,Neutral
334," I'm picturing british and american birds talking to each other lol. I would like to see that, but also hang out with cats in Taiwan.",Surprised
334,id love to hear a bird with a cockneyed British accent. do you like cats?,Curious to dive deeper
334," No I actually don't really like cats lol, but you can hang out with them at a cafe in Taiwan. I think that would be interesting.",Curious to dive deeper
334," that would be interesting, but i would avoid it, im allergic!",Neutral
334,Wise person you are! Have you seen the godfather? I guess the cat in the opening scene was a stray they found on set!,Curious to dive deeper
334,i actually havent but id love to. i wonder if they paid that cat SAG day rates,Neutral
334," haha or in cat treats? I envy the life of a cat, it spends most of its life sleeping lol.",Curious to dive deeper
334," that would be fun, so much better than working all day long",Neutral
334,I agree! Would you ever want a cat as your town mayor?,Curious to dive deeper
334,haha it would about as useful as my current mayor....what town elected a cat???,Surprised
334," It was Talkeetna, Alaska! I'm going to look more into that now! Have a great day. Awesome chat!",Curious to dive deeper
335," Hello there, do you follow baseball or MLB much?",Curious to dive deeper
335," I do, although I haven't followed it much the past couple of years.",Happy
335," I am the opposite, I have been following more closely these last few, especially this last season as my team almost made the world series. ",Curious to dive deeper
335," Oh, which team is that? Is it the Cubs? They were the first team to win back to back World Series.",Happy
335," No, I am a fan of the Brewers, I have never seen them play in a series, one game away.  ",Curious to dive deeper
335,What was the longest at bat you've ever seen? There is some question as to what the longest at bat ever was.,Happy
335," I don't know probably only 20 pitches or so, but I figure the longest is pretty darn long.  Did you know managers can technically play if needed?",Curious to dive deeper
335," I didn't know that, but it makes sense. Also, apparently the longest at bat ever was 21 pitches. ",Happy
335," That is all, that doesn't seem like very many considering a full count is minimal 5 pitches.  ",Curious to dive deeper
335," Well, apparently there is some dispute. The 'story' doesn't match any game on record, but the story has been told for over 70 years.",Happy
335," Yeah and I guess the records began being kept in 1988, so who knows what it was before that. ",Curious to dive deeper
335," Yeah, I guess 1998 is considered the modern era. Before that teams didn't watch stats too closely.",Happy
335," That is crazy, that doesn't see that long ago.  I'm sure there are all kinds of crazy records before then. ",Curious to dive deeper
335," Cy Young apparently won 435 games, now 200 is considered incredible. ",Happy
335," Holy cow that is a crazy amount of baseball games to win, not just start, but win. ",Curious to dive deeper
335,I can see why they named the yearly pitching trophy after him.,Happy
335,Yeah I agree with you on that. Did you know that kickball is also called soccer-baseball up in Canada?,Curious to dive deeper
335,I didn't know that. Did you by chance read about that in the library which is a collection of information sources?,Happy
335,Yeah isn't that pretty funny?  I read that in some random facts I saw online.,Curious to dive deeper
335," Ha, I like random facts. Did you know North Korea holds the record for the largest mass gymnastic performance?",Happy
335," No, I didn't know that, what a weird record to go after.  Well it was nice talking with you today, I hope you enjoy the rest of the day. ",Happy
336,Do you like game of thrones?,Neutral
336," I do, its one of my favorite shows, Dacid Benioff is a genious, so much imagination, do you like the show?",Curious to dive deeper
336,I do. He did a good job adapting Martin's fantasy novels into a tv series.,Neutral
336," George R. R. Martin is one of my favorite writters as well, I didnt know the show was filmed in Ireland, the country has beutiful landscapes",Curious to dive deeper
336,They did a good job worldbuilding and making a somewhat medieval setting,Neutral
336," Yeah and also picking up the cast, like Harry Lloyd, he is a decendant of Dickens",Curious to dive deeper
336,Ya an talisa maegyr is played by charlie chaplin's granddaughter,Neutral
336," A lot of talent in the show, there is a natgeo show called Game of Lions, seems like a fun show to watch lol",Curious to dive deeper
336,Well another good decision aside from the scene the director made is to film it in ireland. They actually get financed by ireland since the film would encourage tourism,Neutral
336," I wonder if that strategy works for the country, I guess it does since many people around the world watch the show",Curious to dive deeper
336,I'm sure it does. Which arcs did you enjoy the most of got,Neutral
336," I liked the second story arc, that one was amazing what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
336,I like the 3rd arc since it makes everything else pale and insignificant in comparison. Oh but I liked it when jeffry died,Neutral
336," Yeah Jeffry had it coming, it was a fair death, he was a cruel boy and the actor was pretty good",Curious to dive deeper
336,Are you excited for the 8th season?,Neutral
336," I am, too bad its going to be the final one but I guess the show will leave on a high note",Happy
336," Honestly, I have no clue how they are going to fit all the action and story into 1 season when it took 7 to get here. I just hope it doesn't feel rushed or left a a cliff hanger. In any case, since the 3rd arc focuses on the legendary dangers of the north threatening the known realm, there will be a battle to remember",Neutral
336," Thats a sure thing, it will be a battle to remember and it feels rushed, theres a lot more the show can give us, I like how Arya acts as well, she has become a badass",Curious to dive deeper
336,I guess it is due to her success that the name Arya is rapidly becoming the popular girl baby name,Neutral
336,Its funny how a show can have an influence even on things like that one,Curious to dive deeper
336," Indeed. In any case, thank you for the enjoyable chat about got and I hope you enjoy the 8th season",Neutral
337," Hi, how are you?",Happy
337," Hi, I'm doing good how are you?",Neutral
337," I'm good, thanks for asking.  Do you watch Game of Thrones?",Curious to dive deeper
337," I've never actually seen GOT. The only thing I know about it, is that it's a drama show.",Neutral
337," I've watched it a few times, it's a pretty good show.I've never seen the National Geographic show called Game of lions, though.  Have you?",Curious to dive deeper
337," No, I can't say that I have. I haven't even heard of that either. What did you like about Game of Thrones?",Neutral
337," I like fantasy type shows and this one has a large cast with several plot lines going on at the same time.  It holds your interest and is never boring. Scenery is beautiful, it gets filmed in Ireland, Canada Iceland, Malta Scotland, Spain, and the U.S.",Happy
337,I think the only guy I really know from the show is Peter Dinklage because he won an Emmy for being on the show.,Neutral
337," Well. Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter plays Talis on the show, also.",Neutral
337,That is interesting! The show comes on HBO right? I'll have to check it out sometime.,Surprised
337," Yes, it does.  Just binge watch it, all seven seasons.  The eighth season doesn't premiere until April, so you have some time to get up to speed, it's worth watching!",Happy
337,Eight seasons? That means it came out in 2011. That is a long time for a show to be on and still being successful.,Neutral
337," Yeah, that long.  It has a big following, so much so that Arya the name of one of the characters is the fastest rising baby name for girls in the U.S.",Surprised
337,That is a little disturbing. Not sure I would name my kid from a TV show. I think the actor that played Arya was actually her first role in anything.,Surprised
337," I know right.  I wouldn't either, but some people are very big fans. Lol",Surprised
337,I'm not that big of a fan of anything. Lots of celebrities are overrated. In 2007 Paris Hilton was voted the most overrated celebrity.,Neutral
337," Me either and I remember when Paris Hilton was everywhere.  I wish the Kardashians would go the same way.  They are way overrated, as well.  ",Disgusted
337," Yeah, the Kardashians are the very definition of celebrity. They garner so much public attention by mass media and I have no clue what they are actually known for.",Neutral
337,I don't think nobody does. Lol Do you know that Robin Williams started the trens of celebrities doing the voices in animated movies?  He was the best doing the Genie's voice in Aladdin.,Curious to dive deeper
337," I didn't know he was responsible foe that at all. That is very interesting, but I did know he was the voice of Genie. The guy was a national treasure.",Surprised
337," Yes, he was, gone much too soon. Well, it's been nice talking with you this morning.  I hope you have a good day. ",Happy
338,Hi There ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;),Curious to dive deeper
338," Hi, how are you doing?",Curious to dive deeper
338,pretty good thx :) Did You hear the universe may be one giant superhologram ? I can't seem to wrap my head around it... can You ?,Curious to dive deeper
338," i did not, that would be pretty wild, they should make a commercial about that",Curious to dive deeper
338," They should make a National Geographic special ! lol, even then I don't know if I would understand that... ",Curious to dive deeper
338,they should! i like the theory that there is one electron in the universe!,Curious to dive deeper
338,ugh... another one... I'm Polish man... cut me some slack here :),Happy
338,I am sorry?,Surprised
338,I am too... :) I'm saying it's another subject I don't understand ;) one electron ? What does that mean ? I thought there are billions of them...,Curious to dive deeper
338," i thought so as well, maybe the theory is we are all super small?",Curious to dive deeper
338,Hey ;) there is nothing small about me man ;) lol,Happy
338," I got you haha. what do you think abuot celebrities? judge judy makes 123,000 per episode apparently!",Curious to dive deeper
338," That's really a lot... I mean I like her, but I remember when I was much younger, I thought she is not a real judge... that it's just a show :)",Happy
338,She makes the second most of any celebrity other than lebron James actually!,Surprised
338," Oh, You're a fan ? ;)",Curious to dive deeper
338," I think he is a great player, but I love Dirk Nowitzki a lot more",Curious to dive deeper
338,I don't think I know him... what team is he playing in ?,Curious to dive deeper
338," he is on the mavericks! i read that pixar has a secret room for celebrities, that is pretty cool!",Curious to dive deeper
338,They do work with a lot of celebrities so I guess that makes sense. I always liked Pixar - beautiful graphics and great sense of humor ;),Happy
338," they really do make some great and wholesome movies, i liked alladdin with robin williams!",Curious to dive deeper
338," That was done by Pixar ? I don't think so, but I might be mistaking...",Surprised
338," it may have just been disney, they work so closely it gets confusing",Curious to dive deeper
339,Do you watch Game of Thrones?,Curious to dive deeper
339," Hi, I have never seen it. What about you?",Curious to dive deeper
339,Are you kidding? its like the best show ever you should really watch it it has about 8 seasons,Surprised
339,Haha I've been wanting to watch it. I saw Harry Lloyd is the great-great grandson of Charles Dickens.,Surprised
339," You should watch it, and yeah the show has a great casting, its based on the novels by George R.R Martin, his a great writer.  ",Curious to dive deeper
339,Very cool. I saw Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter plays Talisa.,Surprised
339," Yeah she is one of the main characters of the show, I feel sad because the eight season is the final one so in April the beggining of the end will happen. ",Sad
339,Oh wow that is sad. I saw there is a Nat Geo show called Game of Lions that follows a pack of lions around.,Surprised
339," That show must be really good, I wonder if they named the show after Game of Thrones. ",Curious to dive deeper
339,I think so. Do you know much about the universe?,Curious to dive deeper
339," I love reading about the universe its one of my passions, what about yourself? ",Curious to dive deeper
339,I feel the same way. There are scientists who think the universes evolve through natural selection like species here on Earth.,Surprised
339," That is an interesting theory, they might be on to something, there is also a theory that states that the universe is one giant super hologram.",Curious to dive deeper
339,Interesting...a giant hologram! I saw there are stars cold enough to be touched by human hands.,Surprised
339," That is also a cool fact, then there's also the theory that there's only one electron in the universe.",Curious to dive deeper
339,That is a very interesting theory. Do you follow celebrities?,Curious to dive deeper
339," I do follow them, many of them make lots of money I kind of envy that",Curious to dive deeper
339,Me too. Pixar has a secret room often visited by celebrities.,Surprised
339," It does? I wonder who has been there before, maybe Robin Williams before he past away. ",Curious to dive deeper
339,Possibly. He was the voice of the Genie in the Aladdin movie.,Surprised
339," Yeah he was the voice of Aladdin in animated films and left a big legacy behind as he started this trend of celebrity voices of animated films, anyway its been great chatting. ",Curious to dive deeper
339,Such a shame he passed away. Good chatting with you too. Take care!,Happy
340,did you know that Tom Cruise spent ten million dollars to make a bunker that protects him from aliens lol,Surprised
340," I did not, I wonder if it was from the star that flickers some people think it is aliens!",Curious to dive deeper
340," that would be scary! according to the xfiles, aliens would colonize earth in 2012, at least that never came to pass!",Surprised
340," Thankfully, They named it Tabby's star!",Curious to dive deeper
340," ah interesting, I guess the alien figures from the Aliens movies were based on sea creatures from deep in Earth's ocean",Surprised
340," Wow, That star has its own subreddit.",Curious to dive deeper
340," that is weird, did you know that it might be aliens, Astronomers have discovered a system that is 455 light years away with the building blocks of life?",Curious to dive deeper
340," I believe it the universe is huge, earth is also 4.5 billion years old.",Curious to dive deeper
340," that is crazy, I didn't know that uranus rolls around sideways in its orbit instead of just spinning like Earth does",Surprised
340," Interesting, What is kind of sad is that 80 percent of earths forests have been destroyed.",Sad
340," yes that is sad, also crazy that when the earth was made a day was only about 6 hours long, thats a super fast day!",Surprised
340," Wow, also interesting is the core is molten lava but the caps are ice!",Curious to dive deeper
340," ya that is interesting, it's scary to me that we wilsl run out of helium by the end of this century, I know that it's very important for manufacturing electronics",Surprised
340," That cant be good, hopefully they invent a way to create it.",Surprised
340," yes I agree, crazy that we will run out of helium but humans have only been on this planet for about a minute if you count the planet's history as a 24 hour day",Surprised
340,That is not very long at all! There is a planet where it rains glass!,Curious to dive deeper
340," ha that would be wild to see! I wondder if that planet has aliens? I guess firefighters are trained on how to treat aliens in case they ever visit, which seems like a waste of time haha",Surprised
340," I guess better safe than sorry, Jupiter's moon would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun.",Curious to dive deeper
340," that is crazy, also with venus, I don't know if you know, but it has no seasons and is the only planet to spin clock wise, the rest spin counter clockwise",Surprised
340," I did not know that, The name of Jupiter's moon is Ganymede, kind of odd huh?",Curious to dive deeper
340," that is very odd, I don't know who dreamed that up but I would have come up with a better name myself!",Surprised
341,Earth is the third planet from the sun and it is the only planet to have water in liquid form.,Happy
341," Yeah and Earth's surface is covered by about 71% water, mostly oceans.",Curious to dive deeper
341,Only 3% water is fresh water which is used for drinking. Earth has one natural satellite is Moon. The earth receives its light and heat from the sun.,Happy
341,Yeah and scientists say that earth will be virtually helium free by the end of the 21st century1 Crazy!,Surprised
341,The earth spins on its own axis it causes for the day and night changes. If day in one part of the earth may be other part of earth have night.,Curious to dive deeper
341," Earth's axis is tilted with respect to it's orbital plane, producing seasons. Thank goodness for seasons. My favorite is Spring!",Happy
341,The layer of the lithosphere is the upper most layer. Almost 71% of earth surface is covered with water remaining 29% is of water. The polar region are covered with snow or ice.,Happy
341," Hm. The planet Uranus actually rotates sideways and ""rolls"" around the sun rather than ""spinning"" like other planets!",Surprised
341,Very interesting. Already 80% of forest area in the world has been destroyed which results in global warming and climate changes and affects the green houses of the environment. Lot of pollution also.,Happy
341," Yeah, sadly mostly human activities are to blame for that, including massive deforestation for many reasons. ",Sad
341," Planet is a term that has been used since ancient times in the context of history, astrology, science, mythology and religion. There are five planets visible to naked eyes in the solar system.",Happy
341," Yep, I've seen all of the naked eye planets. Have you?",Curious to dive deeper
341," Yes, Venus rises before the sun, so early that it is called the morning star.",Happy
341,Ah yes! Have you ever seen Jupiter or Saturn with just your eyes?,Curious to dive deeper
341,It is small planet we can see them with the help of telescope.,Curious to dive deeper
341,Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun. It's so big!,Surprised
341,Jupiter is the only planet which largest amount of artfical satellite.,Curious to dive deeper
341," I think Earth is the planet with the largest amount of artificial satellites. Jupiter likely has the largest natural satellites, which we call moons.",Neutral
341,Earth has only one natural satellite is moon.,Curious to dive deeper
341," Yes that's true. Sometimes the moon is called Luna. The moon is responsible for making the earth's tides, via the tidal bulge of the planet. ",Neutral
341,It is very interesting news.,Happy
341,It was nice talking to you! Goodbye! :),Happy
342,Do you truly believe aliens exist?,Neutral
342,Yes I do.  I don't think we are all alone in this universe.  What do you think?,Curious to dive deeper
342,To be honest it has to be possible think about all the species of animals especially the ones we don't even know about in the ocean. Dolphins are already smarter then us so how could aliens not exist,Happy
342," I so believe we'll eventually find some.  But, I feel kind of like Stephen Hawking, it's dangerous to be communicating with them.",Fearful
342,But what if people like stephan hawking understood things we dont' he is on another level of intelligence kind of like elon musk they are the human versions of aliens with their brains,Curious to dive deeper
342," I agree with you about that.  If we found some aliens, I'd say let's watch them for a good long time before any attempts at communication and they probably feel the same way about communicating with us.",Curious to dive deeper
342," Exactly if aliens wanted to harm us they could have easily already have done it, they don't want to interfere with us we shouldn't interfere with them",Neutral
342," I agree, there's something to it, though when the UN has a contigency plan in place should aliens ever attempt to contact the Earth.  So, somebody knows something, they just can't alert the masses and create panic around the world.",Curious to dive deeper
342,So true and don't you find it wierd how drones were first military technology and then a couple of years later it becomes available to the public. Where did the military steal their ideas from drone technology from?,Happy
342," The same place they stole a whole bunch of their other ""ideas"".  It's just a matter of time, but hopefully Trump will have his Space force up and running by then. Lol",Curious to dive deeper
342,We're getting into alex jones and joe rogan territory here lol you should watch that on youtube so you can have a good laugh,Surprised
342," I'll have to check it out, for sure.  On a side note, I hear that the Hudson Bay region of Canada has less gravity than the rest of Earth. Wonder why?",Curious to dive deeper
342,Might have something to do with magnetic fields we need to get neil degrasse tyson on the case he'll figure it out,Curious to dive deeper
342," Lol, I'm just wondering, will I be lighter on my feet there?  And will the weight of the world not feel like its on my shoulders?  Asking for a friend.",Curious to dive deeper
342,LOL these are the real questions the people want to know,Neutral
342,Exactly!  I read that Jupiter saves the Earth from getting hit by so many asteroids.  That's very nice of it.,Happy
342,Poor jupiter its basically a giant shield for our great ball of water,Curious to dive deeper
342,True and poor old Pluto lost its designation as a planet!  Wow!,Surprised
342,Pluto will always be a planet in my heart lol they can't just suddenly change something like that,Happy
342," That's how I feel too, about little ole Pluto.  I feel like the bullies are picking on him and I need to stand up and defend the little guy.  ",Angry
342,Listen Pluto will always be a planet there's probably support groups for this kind of thing lol,Happy
342," I hear ya!  Well, it's been fun chatting with you, friend.  I bid you good night.",Happy
342,Have an awesome night go watch alex jones and joe rogan real quick on youtube and have a laugh,Surprised
342," Ok, will do!",Curious to dive deeper
343," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
343," Great, how are you?",Neutral
343,I am well. Do you believe in aliens?,Curious to dive deeper
343," The one's from space? Not likely to have happened, though there is life on other planets. What about you?",Neutral
343,Not really. I am not even remotely interested in space so I usually ignore that stuff. X-files on the other hand...,Happy
343,The aliens missed their colonization date. Why so close to Christmas? I guess the winter solstice is a good date.,Neutral
343,What a bunch of downers. At least we have will smith to protect us!,Curious to dive deeper
343,Did you know that over 80 percent of the Earth's forests have already been destroyed? Maybe the aliens will be appalled at the destruction and leave.,Neutral
343,Or our level of stupidity and move on so we don't ruin their planet.,Sad
343," In September 2010, the UN appointed an ambassador to extraterrestrials in case they make contact with us. I wonder how you quality for THAT job. Seems like there would be little to do.",Curious to dive deeper
343," Yeah. I am not sure that's a full-time job. ""Any aliens today?"" ""No."" ""See you tomorrow!""",Happy
343,There seems to be more pressing problems. Earth will be helium-free by the end of the 21st century. Where will we get helium for our balloons? Maybe the aliens will bring some for us.,Neutral
343," Can helium be created in a lab? On a personal note, I have two helium balloons stuck in my vaulted ceiling. That helium lasts for at least 3 weeks. It is getting tiresome.]",Angry
343," In 2007 Tom Cruise spent millions on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens. Maybe he knows some of the firefighters trained in treating aliens, in the event of a UFO crash. Or maybe he has a secret helium source.",Neutral
343," As long as he is not jumping on the couches in his bunker, I am fine with it. He seems a little weird...",Happy
343," Speaking of weird, the world's longest name is a story about a shepherd protecting his sheep and humanity from aliens. Who has this name, and why? Are the parents X-files fans?",Curious to dive deeper
343,Aliens were based of creatures found in the ocean? I feel like there is a lot in the ocean we do not know about.,Curious to dive deeper
343," We haven't been around very long. If Earth's history were viewed as a 24 hour period, we would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds. ",Neutral
343," You're right, that's not long at all!",Surprised
343," When Earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long. By the time the aliens show up, the day will be 40 hours long and the work day will be 20 hours. The alien overlords won't pay us overtime either.  Well, I enjoyed chatting!",Neutral
343,Me too!,Happy
344," Hi, how are you doing this evening?",Neutral
344," I'm doing well, how are you? ",Curious to dive deeper
344,I'm great! Are you knowledgeable of the sport known as baseball?,Neutral
344," Yeah, I used to play when I was younger. Did you know a 17 year old female pitcher was banned from professional baseball after she struck out babe ruth? ",Curious to dive deeper
344,That sounds unfair! She should have been hired on the spot! fans would pay to see that!,Neutral
344," Hilarious, did you know the opposing team receives three bases if a player catches a baseball in their hat? ",Curious to dive deeper
344,How often does that happen? Has an umpire ever really done that? I have questions.,Curious to dive deeper
344," I'm not sure, it doesn't seem like a real rule does it? ",Curious to dive deeper
344,It sounds bogus. Three bases? I've never heard of that. Somebody check the rule book! Giamatti would not accept that rule.,Angry
344," Yeah, some of the stuff you read isn't always true. Did you know that the Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win Back To Back World Series. ",Curious to dive deeper
344," The Cubbies, a sad story. How could they put on such a losing streak? They signed a deal with the devil to win back to back, and then never win again.",Neutral
344," Well they won recently didn't they? I think in 2014 or maybe it was 16, it slips my memory. ",Curious to dive deeper
344," Did they? Did they break the curse? I didn't know that. I figured they had made their deal, but now I guess they made a new deal with the devil. Why do managers wear uniforms now?",Neutral
344," I believe they did. BTW, do you watch the show Game of Thrones? ",Curious to dive deeper
344," I've heard of it. HBO, right? Some guy wrote some books, but takes forever to get new stuff done, yeah?",Curious to dive deeper
344," It is on HBO, anyways, one of the actors who is real big and looks old in the show is actually only 25 years old. ",Surprised
344," Hm.That sounds odd. I know that they shoot all around the world, which is a really cool thing.",Neutral
344,Did you know the Dodgers have lost more World Series than any other team.,Surprised
344,That is a saddening statisic. How much the fans must deplore that record.,Neutral
344," Yeah, it is pretty bad. Have you ever seen them play? ",Curious to dive deeper
344,I have never seen the Dodgers but I expect that LA must have money because of the many fans.,Neutral
344,I've been to the Stadium before. It is not that great. Nice chatting with you.,Curious to dive deeper
345,Well...howdy! What about baseball and the World Series?,Happy
345,I'm a fan. Are you a fan of baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
345," Well, I'm not an Astros fan, I'm a Cleveland Indians fan. How about you? What baseball city you like?",Curious to dive deeper
345,I'm a Nationals fan. It seems like the Astros made a splashy move by not having to commit tens of millions of dollars in annual salary well into the next decade.,Curious to dive deeper
345,I hear ya....do you think Gerrit Cole is worth all the effort to get him?,Curious to dive deeper
345," I'm not sure, probably not, but let's see. Did you know that the managers wear uniforms because they technically are allowed to play? ",Curious to dive deeper
345,I never new the managers could also play. Can't remember that happening in ages. I always sort of liked Justin Verlander when he was with the Tigers. The Indians always kicked his butt.,Curious to dive deeper
345," Yeah. The Nationals have Bryce Harper, he had a bad year last year, but he is still very highly paid. ",Curious to dive deeper
345," Very true. I was rooting for the Nationals last year, but man they hit the wall late in the baseball season. What happened?",Curious to dive deeper
345," It happens all the time. Crazy, they just can't close the deal. ",Curious to dive deeper
345,That sounds an awful like the Indians. I'm 61 years old and have never seen them in a World Series. I'm beginning to think I never will.,Fearful
345," Crazy. Well, they were in the movie Major League. ",Curious to dive deeper
345,LOL....yep...and with Charlie Sheen playing for them in that. Sheesh. Hey maybe the Nationals and the Tribe will play in the world series this year....ya never know?,Curious to dive deeper
345,That would be cool. Did you know that up until 2005 a married couple scheduled all of the games for the year?,Curious to dive deeper
345,I've never heard that before! I wondered what happened after 2005? Did that married couple get divorced for arguing baseball games...lol,Curious to dive deeper
345," I'm not sure, they probably moved to some sort of automated system. ",Curious to dive deeper
345," Well, that would explain why the Indians play so many silly early baseball games in wintery Cleveland in the early season. Computers must not know weather.",Curious to dive deeper
345,Very true. Did you know somebody found $3 million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic?,Curious to dive deeper
345," I read that! Wonder what they did with the money? Oh....and I do watch Game Of Thrones sometimes, I'm up to Season 5.",Happy
345," I used to, I stopped at Series 4. I hear they get a subsidy from Ireland. ",Curious to dive deeper
345," That's news to me...I'm not a huge fan of Game of Thrones, can't understand them when they talk.",Curious to dive deeper
345," Yeah, it is ok. Well nice chatting with you. ",Curious to dive deeper
346," Hello, do you watch baseball>",Curious to dive deeper
346,I am a fan of baseball - I used to know the married couple who scheduled all 2430 baseball games every year,Neutral
346," Wow, I guess those are the people that you can call mega fans. I am not the biggest baseball fan although I do go to a few games each year",Happy
346,Yes baseball is so popular in Japan many people are surprised to find that it is our national game,Curious to dive deeper
346,I would be surprised too. Kickball is known as soccer-baseball in Canada. That is odd.,Surprised
346," Yes.  I have had a few baseball cards in my day, but one lucky man found his grandfather had saved 3 million dollars worth of cards!",Curious to dive deeper
346,3 million is probably more money that I will ever have. The only things that my grandparents collect are rocks from their childhood. I do no think that those rocks will ever be worth 3 million!,Neutral
346,laugh for sure!  Maybe you should try to be a team manager - they wear uniforms because theoretically they could put themselves in the game and play!,Curious to dive deeper
346,Really ? Although I do not think any of them have ever stepped in. I think that the actual players are much better than the coaches.,Surprised
346,No doubt but it would be fun to see one to step in for an inning - perhaps in the world series championship game,Curious to dive deeper
346," Speaking of the world series, the Ottoman Empire still existed since the last time that the Chicago cubs won the world series!",Surprised
346,That was until a few years ago!  That was a great year.  The curse of the goat!,Neutral
346,What is the curse of the goat? Is it some kind of superstition?,Curious to dive deeper
346,The Cubs did not let a man bring his goat into a baseball game around 1918 and he put a curse on them.  It lasted almost a hundred years!,Neutral
346," Ah, thank you. Speaking of the cubs, they were the very first team to win the world series back to back and they have not won since!",Surprised
346,Yes - even famous players can blow it sometimes too - Babe Ruth was caught stealing in game 7 and it caused his team to lose the 1926 world series,Curious to dive deeper
346,Really? I though Babe Ruth was a renowned baseball player. I wonder why he would steal.,Surprised
346,Yes he was a big hitter but sometimes you need to steal a base!  He was a big guy though so probably not that fast,Curious to dive deeper
346,Probably. Do you watch Game of Thrones?,Curious to dive deeper
346,I have never seen it but I have heard a lot about it.  It has received 47 emmy awards so it must be pretty good,Curious to dive deeper
346,47? That is a lot. Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter played Talisa in Game of Thrones!,Happy
346,I had never heard that - I knew Peter Dinklage won several Emmys for the show.,Neutral
347,hey what search engine do you use? Is it google?,Curious to dive deeper
347," Hello, how are you? Yes I use Google predominantly, unless I am looking for videos or music. What about you?",Curious to dive deeper
347," Well Actually I use Bing because they pay you for every search, but it's crazy that Google Maps can tell how congested traffic is by how fast android phones are movie",Surprised
347,I know right. Or the fact that one of Google's search requires more power than it did to send Neil Armstrong and 11 other astronauts to the moon.,Surprised
347,ya that is crazy! I do like that they're a green company and one time used goats to mow their lawn haha,Surprised
347," Yes, goats are very effective.  Talking about google. Google uses andriod devices moments to calculate traffic ",Surprised
347," ya they do, they also are a huge part of internet traffic, when they were down for about 5 mins they took out 40 percent of total web traffic1",Surprised
347,interesting..google tailors its maps around disputed borders based on where the browser is located,Surprised
347," haha that makes sense, do you use Spotify? I only use youtube myself",Curious to dive deeper
347," I use them all, Pandora, You Tube and Spotify. The all have there different  purposes. Spotify has so many songs that 20% of them have never been played.",Curious to dive deeper
347," ya that is crazy, that's about 4 million songs, I guess a musician woul dneed their song played 130,000 times in order to earn minimum wage ",Curious to dive deeper
347," Yes per day, that is crazy. A band earned $20,000 from spotify for a silent album.",Neutral
347," haha that is genius, I guess the guy behind spotify is also the guy who created utorrent which is something I use",Curious to dive deeper
347,I use spotify when I just want something playing in the background or to listen to a whole CD. But when I want to watch the videos I switch to YouTube. Did you know YouTube is the second largest search engine.,Curious to dive deeper
347," I didn't but that makes sense, have you checkout out the police version of youtube, blutube?",Curious to dive deeper
347," I have heard of it but now seen it. I just can't believe the amount of content, in 2017 there were 400 hours of content uploaded every minute, so crazy.",Curious to dive deeper
347," that is crazy, also I remember when Gangnam Style came out and Youtube had to upgrade itself to handle the traffic",Surprised
347,I remember that too. Do you know what the most disliked video on YouTube?,Curious to dive deeper
347," I think it's Baby by Justin bieber, I personally don't think its that bad what about you? LIke it is catchy haha",Surprised
347," It is annoyingly catchy, people are just being haters. There are plenty of other awful things I am sure, just not as popular. Have tried their paid music streaming, have you?",Curious to dive deeper
347," no I have never paid for streaming music, I just use youtube, but I am on a google music trial right now, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
347," I have not paid for anything either, just Netflix. ",Neutral
347,yeah netflix and youtube make up half of internet traffic os it is very likely lots of people use it!,Surprised
348," Game of Thrones seems like one of the most popular TV shows...and it has been for a few years, too, right?",Curious to dive deeper
348,Yeah about 5 or 6 years now.  You dont watch it?,Curious to dive deeper
348," No, but I really want to. I haven't even bought cable TV. I have watched Game of Thrones at friends' houses, though.",Curious to dive deeper
348," Oh thats good,  you should catch up the last season is coming out in april and thats it the show will be done. ",Neutral
348,I really need to catch up on it. I also have no idea what's going on this year with the World Series Baseball.,Curious to dive deeper
348,The actress that plays Arya actually has never been in anything before.  what a break!  First time acting and gets Game of Thrones!,Neutral
348,Is Arya the one that has all the gorgeous fierce dragons on Game of Thrones?,Curious to dive deeper
348," No.  Arya is the little girl,  she looks like a boy,  on purpose. ",Neutral
348,I heard that Ireland finances the Game of Throne series because it's filmed there and they get a good boost of tourism through that. Sounds good to me!,Curious to dive deeper
348," Yes, My aunt and cousin went to visit it last summer,  the pics were amazing!",Neutral
348,Did you know that Charlie Chaplin's Granddaughter plays Talisa Maegyr in the Game of Thrones? I wonder if she has many lines?,Curious to dive deeper
348,I did know that but I dont recognize the name at all so I guess she is not a main character.,Neutral
348,Do they have other cool creatures in the Game of Thrones show besides dragons? I'd love to see unicorns and other things too!,Curious to dive deeper
348," Giant wolves that are called Direwolvles,  White walkers (like dead zombies but frozen one),  Giants.  ",Neutral
348,WOW! Sounds so cool! They have Dire Wolves in this card game called Magic the Gathering. Definitely have giants in that game too.,Curious to dive deeper
348," Oh ok,  I have heard of that game.  Its a card game?",Neutral
348,Yes. I mostly like the artwork on the cards. It's definitely better than watching the World Series baseball. I think my Grandpa used to call it the Fall Classic or something.,Curious to dive deeper
348,Thats cool.. i hardly watch the world series unless the sf giants are in it.,Neutral
348,I think that's a baseball team doing a little better than the Cubs...I heard they haven't won the world series since the Ottoman Empire was in existence. Amazing!,Curious to dive deeper
348,I think the cubs are only in existence to make everyone else feel better about their own team,Happy
348,LOL I bet there is a group of people like that in The Game of Thrones!,Curious to dive deeper
349,Hello. Would you pay 10$ a month for you tube music ?,Disgusted
349," Probably not,  I dont really need it lol I just listen to pandora mostly.",Curious to dive deeper
349,I would rather listen for it with ads,Neutral
349,did you know youtube is the second largest search engine in the world?,Curious to dive deeper
349,Yes I use it every day since 2005 when it was first launched,Surprised
349," I probably use it a lot too,  I look up how-to videos,  reviews,  movie trailers,  tips,  and snowboarding videos lol ",Curious to dive deeper
349,I would like to check out blutube to see the law enforcement videos,Curious to dive deeper
349,Is that available to the public?,Curious to dive deeper
349,I would have to check in to that. Do you like Spotify ?,Curious to dive deeper
349," I honestly have never used it,  I hear it has 4 million songs that have never been played though thats kinda sad. ",Curious to dive deeper
349,yes it is sad. but I just download all my songs from you tube for free,Neutral
349,do you use spotify at all? Did you know a band earned 20k from spotify for a silent album lol,Curious to dive deeper
349,yes but you need like 13745 plays just to make 7.25 a hour,Neutral
349," I guess it depends on how many songs they had on there then,  to make 20 k lol",Curious to dive deeper
349,Do you use google ?,Curious to dive deeper
349,yes probably everyday lol how about u?,Curious to dive deeper
349,i started when the IPO took place back in 2004,Neutral
349,did you know google maps calculates the traffic by how fast android phones are moving?,Curious to dive deeper
349,that is very good to know.,Neutral
349,Instead of hiring people to mow their lawn they once used hundred of goats,Curious to dive deeper
349," and I need to look up ""baby"" by JB just to see why people dont like it",Curious to dive deeper
349," Its a good music video,  i dont know why people dont like it. ",Curious to dive deeper
349,it has been nice chatting with you. Enjoy you tube while is free,Happy
349,Thanks have a good one.,Curious to dive deeper
350,Hey do you like baseball by the way? What do you think about the Nationals,Curious to dive deeper
350,I'm a big baseball fan!  I think they will do ok even though they lost Bryce Harper.  It's kind of the same situation like how they lost Jayson Werth a few years ago.,Happy
350,Speaking of baseball did you know that a baseball manager can actually play for the team if necessary?,Surprised
350,That would be interesting to see!  That's one rule I didn't know.,Happy
350," Yep that's why they wear uniforms, also weird is that in Canada people is known as soccer baseball",Surprised
350,That's interesting too!  Up until 2005 a married couple scheduled all 2430 MLB games for 24 years.,Happy
350,That seems like a lot of work! Do you know why they stopped? The guy who found millions of dollars of baseball cards in his attic is a very lucky dude!,Surprised
350,I don't know why they stopped.  I know I would stop working if I found a million dollars worth of baseball cards!  lol,Happy
350,Yep I could think of a lot of things to do with a million dollars lOL and I would be very happy that my grandfather had them in the Attic,Happy
350,Yes!  No doubt.  Did you know that the womens world cup had a higher tv ratings than the world series in the US?,Happy
350," No I didn't know that that's crazy. also crazy is that baseball is super popular in Japan, they even think that it is their National Pastime and not ours LOL",Surprised
350,lol  Babe Ruth who was known for home runs was caught stealing to end game 7 of the 1926 world series?  Interesting useless stat.  lol,Happy
350,Haha what's an interesting stat. Do you ever watch Game of Thrones? I know that's a change of topic,Curious to dive deeper
350,I've seen it but don't follow it close.  I know it got financed by Ireland because they film scenes there which boosts tourism incomes.,Happy
350," Yep you're right about that. I think it first premiered back in 2011 which seems like a long time ago, I can't wait for the new season to start in April",Happy
350,The next season is supposed to be the last one correct?,Happy
350," Yes it will be the last one. It's crazy that Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter is actually in Game of Thrones, I forget who she is though",Surprised
350,Wow.  I never knew that.  How neat.  I'm going to have to binge watch it and get caught up before the last season begins.  I've heard that Arya is the fastest rising new baby name given to girls in the US most like because of Game of Thrones.,Happy
350," Haha you're right about that! And yes you should definitely check it out, they even made a knockoff series about lions called game of lions LOL",Surprised
350,That's funny!  I see that Harry Lloyd who is on there is the great great great grandson of Charles Dickens.  That is neat they have 2 people related to famous people from a long time ago.,Surprised
350,Yep I agree with you. There's even a guy who is the great grandson of Charles Dickens LOL they've got everyone in the show,Surprised
351,Hello do you like baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
351,I do like baseball. I think it's crazy that the baseball managers can actually play the game. That's why they wear the uniforms,Happy
351," Yeah that is,  considering theres like 20 players on the team,  I think its safe to say the manager can just not suit up lol ",Curious to dive deeper
351,Haha that's a good point. Do you know what they call kickball in Canada,Curious to dive deeper
351,I read it but I dont remember lol,Curious to dive deeper
351," Haha well they call it soccer-baseball, a very dumb name in my opinion LOL",Surprised
351,maybe they should shorten it to like socball lol  sounds better to me.,Curious to dive deeper
351,Lol that does sound a lot better actually. Can you imagine if you found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in your attic. I would probably have a heart attack,Curious to dive deeper
351," i would go on vacations!  Like a really nice one,  then save or invest the rest.  I wish my family collected something cool like that.  ",Curious to dive deeper
351,Yep I agree. Did you know that baseball is super popular in Japan?,Curious to dive deeper
351,who wouldve thought!,Curious to dive deeper
351,I know right. I guess a lot of Japanese are confused in knowing that it is America's national pastime. but we created the game so that's why it's so weird haha,Curious to dive deeper
351,Yeah really.  Do you watch game of thrones?,Curious to dive deeper
351,I do like Game of Thrones. What about you? I can't wait for the new season to start in April,Curious to dive deeper
351,seriously!!! Im re watching all of the season to prepare for it hahaha,Curious to dive deeper
351,Yep I need to do that too! I love that Peter Dinklage has won three Emmy Awards. He does a great job in that show,Curious to dive deeper
351,he does a great of making us hate him lol I really love Tyrion.,Curious to dive deeper
351,Tyrion is awesome haha. It's great that the show has gotten a total of 47 Emmys as well. I even got three Hugo Awards. I just need to know how the show ends haha.,Happy
351," yes I definitely want to see how this crazy show ends,  and I want to see what spin off they will make,  i would really like a tv show about the targaryens!",Curious to dive deeper
351,Yep I think they are making spin-offs to so that will be cool. Have you ever seen the show Game of lions,Curious to dive deeper
351," I have not,  its on my to do list lol I love animal shows too. ",Curious to dive deeper
351,Animals are awesome! It's also crazy how many stars in Game of Thrones are related to famous stars. Let's hope that this season is good!,Happy
352," Hi, do you like baseball?",Neutral
352," Yes, I grew up in St. Louis in the 70's so I used to love the Cardinals, KC in the 90-00's so a big Royals fan and I've been in Boston for 4 years so I have enjoyed local baseball in all three towns. Are you a fan?  I knew that managers wear uniforms in the dugout because they can technically play and there were player-managers in the old days, but when the last time a manager actually played in a game?",Curious to dive deeper
352," Hi, yes I like baseball , and sports in general....and is true I have never seen a manager playing!! but is good they are ready in case they are needed!",Happy
352," It's funny baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans don't know it was America's pastime. I guess they forgot WW II, it was brought there by occupying US Troops after Japan surrendered. ",Curious to dive deeper
352," Wow that is impressive, they kind of ignored how americans feel about baseball.. i think the Chicago cubs have not won in a long time!",Happy
352," Yes, first team to win back-to-back World Series and not another one for 108 years (Ottoman Empire was still in existence when they last won a World Series?), that ironic. As a St. Louis fan growing up I did go to quite a few games at Wrigley Field along the way before they  had lights which made a good afternoon. As I have a lot of Cub fan friends that World Series win was quite something, though many of them felt relief instead of happiness after the win.",Curious to dive deeper
352,That is really cool history right there. Would be nice to see a win from the cubs again. Do you know what a very lucky man found in his grandfather's attic?,Happy
352," You mean the $3 Million dollar baseball card collection? Yes, I collected and bought some rare cards at a shop and know have no idea where they album are, a luck garbage collector might have found them when my mom cleaned out the attic long after I moved out. Being in Red Sox land, there's always the ghost of Babe Ruth, when you look at the big guy he doesn't look fleet of foot, bunny he lost the '26 World series getting caught trying to steal home down by one run. Funny thought, though I doubt Yankee fans thought that , that year.",Curious to dive deeper
352," wow, you collected those too!  I am amazed those cards lasted hidden since the 1940's!!",Happy
352," Yes, I think every kid 1940-19808 probably did. You see where in the '92 World Series the US Marine Corp color guard carried the flag upside down, I wonder if that was planned to psyche them out or distract them from the game plan or totally an accident?",Curious to dive deeper
352,I would be funny if it was an accident.. You lknow? I really like hoe the world series are played.. It is not just one game..you get a seven game playoff and the excitement lasts more than other sports!,Happy
352," Yes, that makes it fairer to the best team. You can win on a fluke shot  or play in one game (i.e. Super Bowl, NCAA Champion), but to win 4 or 7 is more skill. I am a Royals fan and they Won the World Series 4-5 years ago and then lost all their best players to free agency or like Justin Verlander leaving the Tigers and going to the Astro's. With small market teams the skill isn't always evenly distributed around the league. ",Curious to dive deeper
352,Yes that is kind of sad.. and Verlander helped so much the Astros to win.. it was the right move.. for the Astros,Curious to dive deeper
352," Yes, there's two sides to every story. Though small market teams don't have the draw of the Yankee's or Dodgers, you see where the Women's World Cup had higher TV  rating than the World Series in the US last year?",Curious to dive deeper
352,I am a soccer fan and the womens world cup grew a lot in popularity since the last one! But I was shocked to learn that is was watched more than the world series!!,Surprised
352," So was I, speaking of fans. My wife loves Game of Thrones, we're binge watching it getting ready for the final season, do you watch it? It has some great blood lines, did you see where Charles Dickens great-great-great grandson and Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter are both actors on the HBO Series?",Curious to dive deeper
352,I do not watch but I know is really really popular!! Even made the name Arya very popular in new baby girls.,Happy
352," Yes, that crazy to me. I like the show okay, buy my wife is so enthused she'd probably name a kid after one of the shows characters (both our kids are out college, there's no risk in that). It is beautifully filmed, financed by Ireland  with some many scenes set there and Croatia, Canada,  Malta and all the other places they filmed it makes for some beautiful scenery for all the sets.",Curious to dive deeper
352," LOL wow it is film in really beautiful places !!!  I probably will create a game of thrones tour and visit all those places including the sites in Spain, Scottland, Morocco!!",Happy
352," I assure you they already have it in Ireland and soon, if not already there will be cruise lines offering Game of Thrones Themed world cruises. You don't follow the show, but the Lannister's are an evil clan ruling the throne (illegitimately some would say) for many years and Martin, the author of the book said (funny living in Boston area) the Patriots are the Lannister's of the NFL which I think isn't a totally false and funny analogy.",Curious to dive deeper
352,LOL!! I will probably watch Game of Lions!! You know I have enjoyed this chat very much!! Cool facts about baseball history!,Happy
352," Yes, I enjoyed the wide ranging discussion too. Have a great remainder of your week.",Happy
353,Do you like baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
353," Yeah, I'm a Royals fan. I thought it funny that managers wear unis because they can play. ",Surprised
353," Yeah, I never thought that was possible, I think the whole team has to get injured first though",Curious to dive deeper
353,Can you imagine someone like Tommy Lasorda playing.  It would be like Babe Ruth getting caught stealing in the 1926 World Series.,Angry
353," Yeah I can imagine the scenario, Babe Ruth sure was  a great player, too bad his team lost that game back in 1926",Curious to dive deeper
353," Yep.  Funny, kickball is called soccer-baseball in Canada. ",Angry
353," I see, so do you like to watch series? have you watched Game of Thrones before?",Curious to dive deeper
353," Yes and yes... I love GoT, it's a guilty pleasure of mine.  I was surprised to learn that Harry Lloyd was a relative of Charles Dickens.  Love Charles Dickens...",Surprised
353," That is a suprising fact are they really related? guess theres no doubt where his talent comes from, you know the series are financed in part by Ireland",Surprised
353,I heard that.  There are more famous connections too.  Talisa is the granddaughter of Talisa.  Wow.,Surprised
353," I wonder if they knew these facts when they casted the actors of the show, it seems like there's a lot of interesting facts behind the series",Curious to dive deeper
353," I'm sure they let it slip out during the casting.  GoT now has spin offs, a Nat'l Geo show called Game of Lions where lions are like GoT characters. ",Surprised
353," Havent seen that one but sounds like an interesting show for sure, Game of Lions, I wonder how its similar to the series",Curious to dive deeper
353,I can't imagine costuming lions like that.  Can you believe the women's World Cup had better ratings than the World Series in the U.S.?,Surprised
353," It did? maybe because the womens team is pretty good, they always land in a good spot, still, its surprising as baseball is one of the most popular games in America",Curious to dive deeper
353," Yeah, I guess baseball is so popular in Japan that they were surprised to find out it's America's national pastime. ",Surprised
353," Yes Japan has a lot of fans indeed, do you know who the Chicago Cubs are?",Curious to dive deeper
353," Yeah, until they won in 2016, the Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time they won the World Series. ",Surprised
353," I heard they had a big drought before that, its strange how the team was the first to win the series back to back",Curious to dive deeper
353,It was long for sure.  I was glad to see them beat the Indians in 2016.  It was like that had a curse or something like in GoT.,Surprised
353," Yeah it sure seemed that way, its a good thing the curse got lift.",Curious to dive deeper
354," Hi, how are you doing tonight?",Neutral
354," Hi, I'm trying to learn what the word ""accoutrements"" means, do you have any idea?",Curious to dive deeper
354,What are you learning that word for?,Curious to dive deeper
354," Well, it's a new tactic that video game companies are tyring to employ to entice gamers.",Neutral
354," Oh, you mean you need to buy extra and accessories in order to enjoy the game fully? Pretty sneaky. ",Neutral
354," I suppose, do you play video games on consoles like the PlayStation?",Curious to dive deeper
354,I used to play video games a lot as a kid. Don't play now. No time. Little interest. Do you like to play?,Curious to dive deeper
354," No, but the US department of defense used over a thousand of those consoles to build a supercomputer because it was cheaper than the alternative! That sounds like massive processing power!",Surprised
354,That's a smart way to go. Scale up simple units to get the power. I don't really know the PS. Aren't they up to PS4 or something?,Neutral
354," Not sure since I don't play as well either, all I know is that it is created and owned by Sony who launched it in Japan. They were so popular and successful that they've sold at least over 100 million units! Wonder what X-box's numbers are.",Surprised
354,Sony has made a great platform. Are the games good? Usually that drives the sales of the machine. Are the games on all the platforms now?,Curious to dive deeper
354," Not sure since those consoles can be used for research purposes, like researchers are using them to research black holes, maybe they are not only used for games.",Surprised
354,I did hear that the military used the controllers for training troops on equipment. Very intuitive. They learned fast. I don't know why black holes for research though. Why not regular computers?,Neutral
354,Probably since it was cheaper like the supercomputer they built out of the consoles. I wonder if I went on YouTube whether or not I could learn how to build a supercomputer as well. Do you use YouTube?,Curious to dive deeper
354," That's true. Cheaper. I sometimes use Youtube, usually for music.",Neutral
354,I do the same for those purposes as well and for DIY videos which I think is a large reason why its the second largest search engine on the net!,Surprised
354," DIY videos? Sounds interesting. Why is Justin Bieber's ""baby"" is the most disliked video on youtube? Why the hate? I don't like the guy, but what's the point?",Neutral
354," Yeah exactly, like Facebook, they should probably take away that dislike button and spread a little bit more positivity! Unless it's because his die-hard fans are sad that he isn't a ""Baby"" anymore. fans do get crazy sometimes.",Surprised
354,I'm not really up to speed on the new music. I guess I'm getting old. I use Youtube to find my favorites from the old days.,Neutral
354," Not only do they have songs, they even have music videos, backstage access, audio recordings, etc. so you can find them all on there, even the oldies but goodies!",Happy
354," That's great! Police actually have their own youtube called blutube, where they share law enforcement videos. I wonder if there are any secrets there that would be good to know. ""How to get out of a ticket.""",Curious to dive deeper
354," I wonder if there were videos whether or not they'd actually work. Great chat, have a nice day!",Happy
355," Hello, do you happen to have a pet?",Curious to dive deeper
355," No, I don't own a pet. I do like dogs, though. Do you own a pet?",Curious to dive deeper
355," I have a dog, its interesting how there about 12 different blood types, my dog is a donor and I never knew this fact.",Surprised
355,I've heard that there are dog blood drives. I guess the dogs are ok with having a needle in their leg.,Neutral
355," I guess so, some of them might be afraid, you know Google prefers dogs over cats, they are a dog company.",Curious to dive deeper
355,It's probably easier to manage dogs in an office space. Cats won't stay put.,Neutral
355," I agree but cats spend like 66% of their lives sleeping, when they reach the age of 15 they have spent 10 of those years sleeping.",Curious to dive deeper
355," When they're asleep, they're easy to manage. Once they're awake, they wander and explore. Cats would be great if they would sit at a computer and surf the Internet. Istanbul has vending machines that reward dogs for collecting recycled bottles.",Neutral
355," I wonder if thats an effective system, I think it might work and its a way to reduce costs for sure.",Curious to dive deeper
355,I've never been to a cat cafe. There are many of them in Japan and Taiwan. I guess the cats get along with each other and don't have a problem with people trying to pet them.,Neutral
355," Yeah I guess cats are popular in those countries, there is an author that published his cat as the coauthor of his book.",Curious to dive deeper
355," I think he wanted to use the word ""we"" in the paper, so he included his cat as an author. I wonder how a cat got to be the mayor of a town.",Neutral
355," I bet the other politicians were really bad lol, still think mayor Stubbs will do a better work than most politicians.",Curious to dive deeper
355," A cat couldn't really do much harm. Sleeps most of the time. Rest of the time they hunt. Cats have eliminated the bird species of specific areas, even caused extinction.",Neutral
355," They have? wow that is suprising, you know the cat in godfather 1 was actually a strayed one.",Surprised
355," It was a pretty well-behaved cat. I don't think cats will ever be called  ""man's best friend"" but they sure come close.",Neutral
355," I dont think that either, you know dogs are actually not color blind, they can also see colors but not in the way we do.",Curious to dive deeper
355," I'm not surprised. I suspect that many animals can see color, just not like human beings For example, I expect that cats can see color as well.",Neutral
355," I see, I didnt know cats could also see colors that is surprising to me!",Curious to dive deeper
355,Cats probably also have many different blood types. I wonder whether they have blood drives the same as for dogs.,Neutral
355," I bet there are, I mean there are a lot of people who love cats so its really probable.",Neutral
356,I was reading that Jazz trumpeters grew goatees as it provides comfort when they are playing. I never knew that and found it interesting.,Curious to dive deeper
356," That is interesting, so they started it for comfort over style then. ",Curious to dive deeper
356,I guess. I once had a neighbor who was into jazz and would play. He was pretty good. A harlem woman has free concerts at her apartment for the past 20 years and sometimes top performers will stop over. What fun!,Happy
356," That would be fun, and its sounds like her neighbors all like it if it's been happening for 20 years!",Curious to dive deeper
356,Did you know that Wayne Rooney is considering signing with DC United,Curious to dive deeper
356," Yeah I think he did sign with them actually, this must be a bit dated.  I think that is the new norm now with stars coming to the US to end their careers. ",Curious to dive deeper
356,I understand he is not the only one to come to the US. He did sign that is interesting. Do you follow sports much. I do not which is why I had not known.,Curious to dive deeper
356,I do follow sports so that is why I knew.  I am a big fan of english league football actually.,Curious to dive deeper
356,That is wonderful! So DC United is a team in the US. Is the game played the same here in the US and in England?,Curious to dive deeper
356,Yeah they are an MLS which is the American soccer league.  The game is played the same way but we have a playoffs here instead of top of table wins the league.,Curious to dive deeper
356," I think that soccer is a great sport and while I do not follow, I think it is a lot better than american football is. I would imagine that he is a good player as they did want him badly. ",Curious to dive deeper
356," Yeah he is a good player and I think he has been doing good for them so far.  And I agree, and I think american football is far more dangerous a sport to play. ",Curious to dive deeper
356,It certainly is. Soccer is such a popular sport all around the world. I guess a player named Mesut Ozil donated his earnings from a bonus in the World Cup to pay for 23 children in Brazil to have surgeries. What a nice thing to do.,Surprised
356," I read that, I think that is such a cool thing to do.  I know he has been in a tough situation with his national team as of late as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
356,That is too bad for him. Hopefully things turn around. I always wondered why americans call it soccer and I read that is because it was the slang for Association Football. Such a simple reason.,Surprised
356," Yeah I guess it started as a slang term and just caught on for some reason here, I think its stupid that we named american football, football, because most of it is played with our hands!",Curious to dive deeper
356," Ha, ha, I always wondered that as well. It does not make any sense. Honestly I am surprised that soccer is not more popular here in the US Did you read that there is a variation of soccer where 3 teams play at the same time. That must be crazy. ",Surprised
356," Yeah I think I heard about that one time.  I think people here think its too boring because of the score, but it really is the most exciting.  And then I think that they think they need to come up with new games or ways to play to make it more exciting. ",Curious to dive deeper
356,Yes that might be so. Reading about hats and I see birthday hats were derived from dunce hats to encourage foolish behaviour at parties.,Surprised
356,That is pretty interesting.  Did you know the same type of plastic they make legos with is used to make hard hats?,Curious to dive deeper
356," Wow, I never knew that. Funny that they limited hat pins to a certain length, afraid women would use them as weapons. ",Surprised
356," Yeah that is funny!  Well its been nice talking with you, I hope you have a good night. ",Happy
357,Good morning! Do you like dogs?,Surprised
357," I do, I have a dog at home and a cat. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
357," I love dogs. I have one as well, and it's so smart it can understand pointing. I guess dogs and elephants can do that.",Surprised
357," Yeah they are smart. Did you know that they are not color blind, but they can't see as many different colors as humans?",Curious to dive deeper
357," I didn't know that, but that's cool. Did you know google prefers dogs to cats?",Surprised
357,I've heard that their code of conduct specifically states that. That's pretty cool!,Curious to dive deeper
357," Speaking of cats, when a cat reaches 15, they've spent 10 of it sleeping. Must be nice!",Curious to dive deeper
357,That's funny. Did you know there's a town in Alaska has had a cat as its mayor since 1997.,Curious to dive deeper
357," They have my vote! Cats are famous sometimes, even one from the Godfather part 1 that was a stray on set!",Surprised
357,Did you know there's cat cafe's in Japan and Taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks. I wonder if that would go over well here.,Curious to dive deeper
357," I think it would with dogs, since they perform many roles for humans!",Surprised
357,I didn't know that they have 12 different blood types.,Surprised
357,Me neither! They also have dog blood drives for them to donate to!,Surprised
357,I need to take my dog to one. I give blood all the time so he should too.,Curious to dive deeper
357,I'm sure he would save many dog's lives! I wish I lived in Hawaii as far as business attire goes!,Surprised
357,I'd like wearing an Aloha shirt instead of my uniform. I dress pretty much like Billy Mays' pallbearers. Blue shirt and khaki pants.,Curious to dive deeper
357,That is one nice style you have there! I wear polo shirts but didn't know they were invented for tennis players!,Surprised
357," I never knew that either. They were invented by Rene ""The Crocodile"" Lacoste.",Curious to dive deeper
357," What a nickname! I can see why it was later adopted by polo players, hence the name!",Surprised
357," Yeah I can see that too. In China during the cultural revolution, gang fashion involved layering as many shirts as you could and popping their color. That's a fashion that I'm glad died. ",Curious to dive deeper
357," I am too. I always laughed at those people. Well it was nice chatting with you, have a great day!",Curious to dive deeper
358,Hi do you like cats? They are definitely good at hunting vermin!,Curious to dive deeper
358,Agreed. I do love cats as well as most pets! Did you know the cat used in the opening scene of The Godfather was actually a stray they found on set? I thought that was pretty cool!,Neutral
358,Oh that is super cool. From rags to riches. A cats life must be nice. They spend over half their life sleeping!,Surprised
358,That us true. Ha! I would like to visit one of those cat cafes over in Japan that lets you pay by the hour to drink and play with cats! I bet that's so interesting!,Neutral
358,That would be fun! Also there is a town in Alaska that has a cat mayor!,Surprised
358,Is that so? That's a little odd! Ha! Did you ever hear about the physicist that published his cat as coauthor so he could avoid criticism by writing in first person plural?,Neutral
358,Haha I never knew about that. However I also like dogs too. They were the first species to be domesticated!,Surprised
358," I love dogs as well! It's crazy only dogs and elephants are the only animals that can understand pointing, isn't it?",Surprised
358,Yeah I agree I would think more animals would understand that. Google also prefers dogs to cats which is kind of funny that they declare such a thing.,Happy
358," I know, right? I wonder if they have vending machines around their buildings that releases water and food in exchange for bottles like Istanbul does. It'd be nice if our country could do that! ",Curious to dive deeper
358,Yeah probably not a ton of strays in Palo Alto! But yeah I think that is a cool idea to promote recycling.,Neutral
358,Agreed and help stray dogs as well. I also think its crazy that dogs can't see as many different colors as we humans can.,Surprised
358,Yeah that is interesting. I think it's funny when owners put shirts on their dogs. They probably put Hawaiian shirts on their dogs in Hawaii!,Curious to dive deeper
358," Ha! Probably so. You know, I've always loved the term man's best friend. They do so much for humans like companionship, hunting, protecting, pulling and even therapeutic roles, man's best friend is the perfect term, in my opinion!",Happy
358,Yeah totally agree with you. Did you know that the official business attire in Hawaii is the aloha shirt instead of a traditional suit and tie?,Surprised
358,Is it really? That's kind of funny! Ha! I do know the pallbearers at Billy Mays' funeral wore khakis and blue shirts. That was very nice of them.,Happy
358,Interesting. In china the gang layered as many shirts as possible and popped their collars!,Surprised
358,Now that's interesting. Ha! I also think it's interesting that button down is when collar tips fasten to the body of the shirt and button up does not. I never really realized that!,Surprised
358,Yeah I didn't know that either. I always thought polo shirts were designed by polo players but they were originally invented by tennis players!,Surprised
358," Were they really? I figured polo players invented them as well. But you know, in American English, the term shirt is such a catch all term that represents a wide variety of upper body garments and even undergarments. ",Surprised
358,Yeah I agree it does. In Britain they have more specific definition of the word.,Curious to dive deeper
358,Yeah it's more specifically a garner with a collar and sleeves with cuffs along with a full vertical opening with buttons. We would actually refer to it as a dress shirt. Ha! Well it was great chatting with you! Have a nice day!,Neutral
359,Many people enjoy chatting on the Internet. Do you? Do you like computers?,Curious to dive deeper
359," I do actually, I use the computer a lot. I just do not have that kind that the russians made that runs on water",Curious to dive deeper
359," The water computer sounds alien, like something that Elon Musk would create. I wonder how fast that darn thing ran. As fast as Windows 8 maybe.",Neutral
359," I am not sure since it was also a very long time ago, in 1936.",Curious to dive deeper
359," 1936. That was a great year for water computers. Since then, not so good. I expected the Russians to make one that ran on vodka, but then again, vodka is too precious for computers. WOuld you upload your mind to a computer? If it ran on vodka, I would.",Neutral
359,No I do not think so but it seems transhumanists are trying to do that. Curious to see if they succeed,Curious to dive deeper
359," If they succeed, they will have long boring lives. They will spend their time chatting on the Internet for cash to buy upgrades.",Neutral
359,That sounds very probable. DO you have a PC or an Apple computer?,Curious to dive deeper
359,I have a PC. I have used Apple stuff though. You? Playstation?,Neutral
359,Yeah I have an Apple so I guess good thing that I am not a smoker so as not to void the warranty,Curious to dive deeper
359,What about vaping though? Is that a problem? Then Apple would lose like 90% of their hipster customers!,Neutral
359," Yeah, right? Do you watch youtube on your computer?",Curious to dive deeper
359,I sometimes watch YouTube to catch up on news and documentaries. You?,Neutral
359,Yeah me too. It is the second largest search engine now on the internet,Curious to dive deeper
359,People are addicted to them vids! The kids can't enough of 'em! Even I go there to listen to my old favorites from back in the day!,Neutral
359,Cool. Do you know which is the most disliked video in there?,Curious to dive deeper
359,Dislliked? I don't know. Some teen idol? Donald Trump?,Neutral
359," Actually is it Justin Bieber, his song Baby",Curious to dive deeper
359," The Bieb! That figures. The guy bothers a lot of people. He's rich, he doesn't care. Things are going his way. ",Neutral
359,I guess so . Have you heard of Bluetube?,Curious to dive deeper
359," Bluetube? Sounds racy. What is it, and how much does it cost?",Neutral
359,It is actually a police YouTube. Nice chat,Happy
360," Hi, how are you?",Happy
360," A little tired because I didn't get enough sleep. Have you ever had a pet cat? By the time they're 15, cats have spent about 10 years of their lives sleeping",Curious to dive deeper
360," Sorry, to hear that.  I have had a cat, she passed away last year and she was 18 years old.  I believe she probably slept 16 out of those 18 years sleeping. lol",Happy
360,I didn't realize that they sleep so much or that there are over 70 breeds!,Surprised
360," My cat was probably the easiest low maintenance pet I ever had,  A lot less needy than my dogs, for sure. Do own any pets?",Curious to dive deeper
360," The only pet I've ever had are fish, though I don't mind cats. I had a friend in college who wants to open her own cat cafe like they have in Japan and Taiwan",Neutral
360," Yeah, I heard about those cafes.  People pay to have a drink and play with cats.  Sounds like an easy way to make money!",Surprised
360,I'm not sure how easy that would be with all the food safety laws we have here in the US. Maybe that's why it hasn't become popular here.,Neutral
360,That's true.  Did you know that dogs have 12 different blood types and can donate at blood drives?,Curious to dive deeper
360,I wonder if their blood types work similarly to ours? I know some dogs would be able to give more blood than others based on their size,Neutral
360," I'm not sure, but they probably work the same, I'd think.  I'm sure there's a big need especially for dogs with cancers.",Curious to dive deeper
360," I think it's interesting how dogs and cats can be different, but both are useful for hunting",Neutral
360,That is interesting. It's also interesting that Istanbul has vending machines that dispense water and food in exchange for recycled plastic bottles.,Surprised
360,That's a genius way to take care of the strays while also encouraging recycling. I bet Google would donate to that type of initiative considering the company loves dog enough to have it in their code of conduct,Neutral
360," Yeah, they are truly a dog company!  We need these machines in America!",Surprised
360," The stray cats could probably benefit from something like that as well. When filming the Godfather, the cat in the opening scene was actually a stray that wandered onto the set",Neutral
360," That's cool, cat was a movie star and didn't even know it. lol I wonder if the cat named Stubbs in Talkeetna, Alaska knows that its the mayor?",Curious to dive deeper
360," Since 1997, nonetheless. That's a long time for an animal to be in a political position. There must not be a large population in that part of Alaska",Surprised
360,Probably held that position longer than some politicians.  Don't have to worry about too many scandals when you're a cat!,Surprised
360,It's about as funny as the physicist whose cat is a coauthor just so his grammar would be correct. It was easier to add the cat than to use first person singular rather than plural,Neutral
360," That is funny too,  You don't have to worry about your grammar either, when you're a cat. It's been nice chatting with you this afternoon.",Happy
361,hello there,Neutral
361,Hello yourself> What have you been getting up to tonight?,Curious to dive deeper
361," Just relaxing, hanging with my dog.  Listening to music. Yourself? ",Happy
361,Similar regarding the dog. I was talking to my roommate about MLS Soccer.,Neutral
361," I like Orlando City, personally. I have a good friend who used to play for Manchester United. ",Curious to dive deeper
361,Really? I bet that was wild.  I didn't think I'd ever need to know much about it myself. We were actually talking about Wayne Rooney a little bit ago.,Curious to dive deeper
361,Do you have any thoughts about where Wayne Rooney will end up next year?,Curious to dive deeper
361,No thoughts but I've heard talk. Atlanta has gone nuts for MLS the last couple of years. We won the Cup this year and now when you walk into a bar you hear guys speculating about Rooney to DC United next year.,Curious to dive deeper
361," Orlando has embraced MLS too, I am quite surprised how popular it has become.  ",Neutral
361,I'm with you 110% on that. I haven't heard anyone talk about how embarrassing the Falcons are in weeks.  It makes sense. We haven't ever really had a winner before. I'm wondering if Rooney can still play or if this is like Beckham playing in LA when the MLS began.,Curious to dive deeper
361," To switch gears for a moment, I'm listening to Dizzy Gillespie at the moment.  He always was a favorite of mine, a trumpet virtuoso. Did you now that jazz trumpeters often grow goatees because it provides comfort when they play their instrument? ",Curious to dive deeper
361,I didn't but I can see why that would be appealing.The facial hair I mean. I've tried to like it but Jazz just doesn't do much for me.  New Orleans jazz is sort of the exception. I like the big brass sections. I do like zydeco and that has a lot of jazz influence.,Curious to dive deeper
361," I definitely would say I prefer music that's influenced by jazz, rather than jazz itself. Tom Waits is my favorite artist ever, and the influence of jazz is present on a lot of his work.  ",Curious to dive deeper
361,I agree with you about the influence it's had on other music. It's kind of funny that you brought up jazz actually.  It's such a mish mash of musical influences from around the world but it's probably still the most original art form that the United States has ever produced.  That's sort of what we've got going on with the Atlanta FC here.,Happy
361," Did you now that the term soccer came from ""association football""? I find that interesting. I always wondered why it wasn't called something else. ",Curious to dive deeper
361,I didn't know that. I've wondered though.  We've got all of these sports fans here from different places with competing team loyalties.  Except for soccer. Most of them never had a pro team that they grew up rooting for.  They all grew up knowing something about that.  I mean we're talking 250 million players worldwide. Now these guys have a team to root for with no competing loyalties. It's a more communal experience and it has taken off around here.,Curious to dive deeper
361," Do you ever go to live games?  It's an experience I have only very recently had an opportunity to possibly enjoy, and yet I haven't.  I wonder if I would enjoy it for the entire duration of the game. ",Curious to dive deeper
361,I haven't gone yet but I'm going to this coming season.  My interest in other sports has waned so the timing is perfect. Get in on the ground floor of something special you know. It's hard to pick up though. You wouldn't think it would you. A big stretch of grass with a goal on either side's more complex than I thought. Theres way more people to talk about it with too. More than all the major American sports leagues combines in terms of fanbase.,Surprised
361," Yep, it gives you something to talk about with so many people from different countries. I think that's really cool. They really mean the ""world"" when they said the world cup, unlike the world series, which is just a national matchup.  That's interesting you say it's tough to pick up. I bet the best way to really learn about it would be to play FIFA video games.",Happy
361,Thats a good point about playing FIFA. That was my only exposure to the sport growing up. There's a much lower barrier to entry to play the game in the real world. Probably part of it's popularity. It's kind of funny. The color scheme and the uniforms here kind of remind me of Harry Potter.  I guess ridiculous hats are a thing in football circles. I don't know how else to explain the goofy ones I've seen around here after FC games.,Curious to dive deeper
361," Sports fans are definitely responsible for some ridiculous hats, like the oversided cowboy hat, that's like measured in gallons rather than regular hat size. I'm not a hat guy myself, my head's too big.  Speaking of cowboy hats, in the old west, the cowboy hat was not the most common hat worn.  It was actually the bowler, which truthfully is a lot classier looking in my opinion. ",Curious to dive deeper
361,Billy the Kid was a bowler hat kind of guy. I like hats because I'm bald. They keep the sweat out of my eyes and keep my head warm.  Sports fans have changed headwear from a social status thing to more of a social group identity thing. Ironically the only times I'm not likely to wear a hat is when it would be the most useful. I've worked in construction most of my life but I could never get used to wearing a hard hat. Lucky I didn't get my brains scrambled.,Curious to dive deeper
361," Goodness. Yeah, the only time I ever wore hats was when a job required me to, for me to display whatever fast food logo I worked for.  And with that thought, I will depart. ",Curious to dive deeper
362," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
362,I'm good!  Do you use youtube?,Happy
362,I do use youtube. Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
362,I do.  I love it!  It's where I first say Psy's Gangnam Style video.  Have you seen it?,Happy
362,I have not seen that one. I haven't seen Justin Beiber's Baby either but that is probably good since it is the most disliked video on the platform.,Surprised
362,lol Poor Beib's.  Psy's video got so many views on youtube that they had to upgrade the view count integer to 64 bits.,Happy
362,You tube is the 2nd largest search engine behind google. Make sense since google owns them.,Surprised
362,I believe that.  Google bought youtube for $1.65 billion dollars!  That's a lot of cash.,Happy
362," That is! Between youtube and netflix, they make up half of peak internet usage.",Surprised
362,I believe it!  People love videos!  Do you have a playstation?,Happy
362,I kind of do... My son has one that I bought him. Do you have one?,Curious to dive deeper
362,My kids do.  I have no idea how to play it. lolol  Playstation 3's are being used to research black holes somehow.,Happy
362,Wow. The DoD used 1760 of them to build a supercomputer...,Surprised
362," Wow.  Who would have thought that?  lol  The original grand theft auto game disc for playstation, when placed in a cd player would play the game soundtrack.  Kind of neat.",Happy
362,That is cool. The last game produced for ps2 was fifa 14. I had no idea.,Surprised
362,I didn't either!  lol  Do you use computers a lot?  In 1936 the Russians made a computer that could run on water!,Happy
362,I do use them a lot. The space shuttles general purpose computer runs on 1 mb of ram.,Surprised
362,Wow.  That's pretty incredible to think about.  Someone built a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic minecraft building blocks.,Happy
362,Maybe it was a transhumanist. They want to upload their mind to computers. I am not sure I would want to do that...,Fearful
362,I would want to do it so my future generations of my descendants can look back at my life.  Be interesting I think.,Happy
362," With that perspective, yes. Nice chatting with you!",Happy
363," Hi, how are you? Do you like jazz?",Neutral
363,Hi there! Yeah I do like jazz! Do you?,Happy
363," Yes, I love jazz. I am listening to some right now. ",Neutral
363," Ah nice! Yeah Jazz is interesting to me simply because it originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans. It's definitely rare and unique, in my opinion. ",Curious to dive deeper
363," It certainly is. I think that it should be more popular, but it is too artistic. Not enough show business, too much art.",Neutral
363,Can you believe that Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts? Wow jazz has made it's way from New Orleans around the entire world!,Surprised
363," Yes, even in Pakistan. I figure that there is value in all genres of music. Perhaps the rest of the world sees the value in jazz.",Neutral
363," There certainly is value in all music, I agree! Which reminds me that I just recently heard that Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and he's scored several films, including Million Dollar Baby!",Surprised
363," He seems like a tough guy, but he is an actor and artist so I'm not surprised. He is not a very good singer though.",Neutral
363," Haha, then maybe I should be happy I've not heard him sing! So I was reading about how jazz trumpeters grew goatees to make playing a bit more comfortable. I wonder if that is possibly the origin of goatees. Maybe, maybe not!",Surprised
363," He sang at the end of Gran Turino. I think people tried all kinds of facial hair, but for brass, maybe it's an obvious choice.",Neutral
363," Hm. I did watch that movie but I just can't remember him singing! I'll check it out again, since now I'm pretty curious! :)",Curious to dive deeper
363,Right at the end. Then another singer takes over. Clint writes good melodies though.,Neutral
363,Interesting to be able to write melodies but not be able to sing so well! I pretty much have the opposite problem. Haha. Clint seems like such a new-age cowboy to me. Speaking of cowboys! The most popular hat in the old west was the bowler hat and not even the cowboy hat!,Curious to dive deeper
363,I guess the bowler was style and class and the cowboy hat was a working hat.,Neutral
363," Personally I prefer cowboy hats, especially since it's associated with hard work, instead of just sophistication and such. :) ",Happy
363," Yes, they have their own kind of cool. the bowler looks stuffy.",Neutral
363," I agree! I prefer hates for functionality such as protecting against weather conditions, sun, and even beanie's for cold weather! Beanies are technically hats, right?",Curious to dive deeper
363," Yes, sure. But dont wear one to a wedding though! anyway, great chat!",Neutral
363,Yeah thanks! It's been great! :),Happy
363,You too!,Neutral
363," Have a great day! If it's cold outside, make sure to wear a beanie! :)",Happy
363," Yes, by all mean.s",Neutral
363," It's pretty sunny here, so I'll maybe wear a baseball cap :) Later!",Happy
363,Bye,Neutral
363,Bye :),Happy
364,Hi?,Neutral
364," Have you heard of visual novels such as ""Stay"" that run on game consoles like Xbox?",Curious to dive deeper
364," No, I have not. That sounds fascinating. How is that different from a movie?",Neutral
364," You interact with it.  In fact if you ignore it, it taunts you.  Intruders invade and all kinds of things happen. ",Happy
364,That sounds like a great way to have fun. I bet the story line is pretty good too. You don't kill things or earn points. Is it popular?,Neutral
364," I would guess so, it's on many different consoles. In certain parts of the story there are minefields. ",Curious to dive deeper
364,I guess I should look into this. Do you use Playstation?,Neutral
364,No.  The most significant thing is that it can have different endings.,Neutral
364,I don't really play video games much anymore. Do you? Do you use computers much? I do.,Neutral
364,I use computers a lot.  Did you know Windows 95 was the 2nd most installed SW in 1995?,Curious to dive deeper
364," W95 was huge for its time. It got delayed several times, but it was a big jump for Microsoft. I used it a lot myself.",Neutral
364,Me too.  The first computer algorithm was written by a woman named Ada.  I wonder if that's where the name ADA came from in computing.,Curious to dive deeper
364," Yes, I believe so. There was a programming language called ADA. I never used it. She was very bright.",Neutral
364,That's what I was saying.  It came from Pascal.  Bell distributed a manual cardboard computer to HS students in 1968 to teach them how that works.  I'd be interested in seeing that.,Curious to dive deeper
364,I see. Pascal and ADA are related languages. Is it in use now? I wouldn't expect so.,Neutral
364," If I remember right, the gov't was pushing ADA.  There's probably a lot of legacy systems with it.  Did you know the first YouTube video was some dude talking about an elephant... ",Curious to dive deeper
364,An elephant? Not ADA? LOL. I guess that makes sense. The first upload was probably pretty basic.,Neutral
364," Now there are 79 full episodes of ""The Joy of Painting"" with Bob Ross.  ",Happy
364," Yes, that man is a legend! Encouraged so many people to try painting. There should be a paint program called Ross.",Neutral
364,Yeah.  Did you know the PS3's only have 256MB of RAM?  That's not much...,Surprised
364," That's not much at all. I'm surprised. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
364,Thanks.,Neutral
365,Are you a fan of Jazz?,Curious to dive deeper
365," hi how are you? yes, i like jazz. You?",Neutral
365,I do. So does Clint Eastwood apparently.,Curious to dive deeper
365," Yeah, he plays piano. he also composes too, ive heard.",Neutral
365,I didn't know that. That is pretty cool.,Curious to dive deeper
365," He is allergic to horses, i think, so maybe he spends more time at the piano now.",Neutral
365," Interesting, I wonder how he shot all of those films then? ",Curious to dive deeper
365," I think he wasnt allergic at first, but then developed an allergy. maybe he is getting treatment now? i dont know",Neutral
365,Interesting. Who would have guessed?,Curious to dive deeper
365,I wonder if clint knows that Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts.,Neutral
365," I'm not sure, but that is a good question. Do you like hats? ",Curious to dive deeper
365," hats are good. stylish, functional. i dont wear them often. You?",Neutral
365," Nah, I think they promote baldness. LOL",Curious to dive deeper
365," good thing i dont wear them then. LOL. Im surprised that the most popular hat in the old west was the bowler, not the cowboy hat",Neutral
365,Interesting. I would have thought the cowboy hat myself.,Curious to dive deeper
365," Yeah, maybe that is a working hat and people wanted to be stylish? i dont know. ",Neutral
365,I'm not sure to be honest. There was a law in 1908 that limited the length of hairpins.,Curious to dive deeper
365," boy, those women and their hairpins! LETHAL! LOL i guess women did not carry guns then? that would have been funny",Neutral
365," Yeah, sounds pretty comical. Well, nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
365," Yes, it has been great chatting! I'm glad that the server is back up! Yay",Neutral
365,Take it easy!,Curious to dive deeper
366,Hello did you know the only fish to have a neck is the seahorse?,Curious to dive deeper
366,I never thought about it but that is interesting! I am kind of frightened that there is a breed of jelly fish that are immortal. Yikes!,Surprised
366," And lobster!  They are immortal in a sense that their organs dont age,  so as long as nothing kills them they can technically live forever. ",Curious to dive deeper
366,Yuck. I don't like that at all. One of the most interesting fish is the balck swallower fish that can eat prey twice its own length and ten times its weight. Sounds like one of those creepy snakes that eat huge animals.,Surprised
366," Yuck?  Ah you dont like seadfood?  I love eating lobster lol I think that fish black swallow is amazing,  to have the ability to have their body stretch like that,  who knows when their next meal will come along. ",Curious to dive deeper
366,I am allergic to shellfish...maybe that is it. But can you believe this...  I named my son Fisher. So there is a little love there!,Happy
366," oh thats too bad, sorry to hear.  Haha Fisher,  thats a great name.  Freshwater fish drink water through their skin!",Curious to dive deeper
366,Interesting! I just learned that there are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth. Crazy!,Curious to dive deeper
366,Yeah and they are not even all discovered yet!  theres a bunch undiscovered animals and insects in the amazon rainforest still.,Curious to dive deeper
366,The rainforest frightens me. Too many creatures! I can only imagine how many insects are in there!  Did you know that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated?,Curious to dive deeper
366,I didnt.  I guess I would never notice because my dog is white lol,Curious to dive deeper
366,That is funny. My dog has a white patch ...but not on it's forehead!  They say that hiccups are a holdover from early evolution when early land animals had gills and lungs.,Surprised
366,I kinda wish we still had gills lol That would be sweet to swim longer under water.,Curious to dive deeper
366,I agree! Look...I love my sleep but there are some birds who fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping when migrating. Exhausting!,Surprised
366," I know right, thats incredible.  I also love sleeping. ",Curious to dive deeper
366,Naps are the best! I like that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. Where do you think they hide it?,Surprised
366,The hummingbirds?  I have no clue lol Where do they hide?,Curious to dive deeper
366,No!  I was asking where they hide the spiderweb when they are stealing it.  I was trying to be funny.  Didn't work!  LOL!  One fact is that birds bones are so hollow that the entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers!,Surprised
366," Oh lol  Thats horrible, i wouldnt want hollow bones lol I guess it makes sense for them,  they have to be light enough to fly ",Curious to dive deeper
366," True! Good point! In Australia there are wild birds that can mimic the sound of cameras, car alarms and chainsaws! Creepy!",Surprised
366,wow that is really creepy!  I wonder what bird does that lol Its been fun chatting.,Curious to dive deeper
367," hi, do you like soccer?",Curious to dive deeper
367,To be honest I don't like soccer. But I may watch the World Cup if the USA makes it to that point. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
367,Yeah I like it because it is so international. did  you know the city where it will be hosted in 2022 does not exist yet,Curious to dive deeper
367," That is crazy. Are you going to watch it? I don't know how they can just create a city out of nowhere and have it ready for 2022, but we'll see what happens",Curious to dive deeper
367," Yeah I am looking forward to it and yes, I do not know how that is going to work",Curious to dive deeper
367,I do like the United States and soccer though. They got third place back in 1930 which was the first FIFA World Cup,Happy
367," Nice, maybe they manage to climb back. you never know. The countries that host it do not have any net economic gains",Curious to dive deeper
367,Nope I heard about that. That's why I wonder why they're making an entire city for the World Cup. I guess the women's soccer team is better than the men's soccer team in the United States. Is that correct?,Curious to dive deeper
367," Yup, they seem to do much better. soccer players make more money than other sports combined, well the major ones",Curious to dive deeper
367,That is really crazy. I know that football the United States makes a ton of money too. I always wondered why Americans call it soccer. I guess that is slang for association football,Surprised
367,Yeah I think football means differnt things in many different countries,Curious to dive deeper
367,Yeah I think you're right. I want to see the soccer variation with three teams. I bet that's really insane,Surprised
367,yeah that would be interesting to know. a german soccer player donated his winning from the world cup to kids in brazil,Curious to dive deeper
367,Wow that's really nice of him. I think it was something like three hundred thousand Euros? And it was paying for surgeries for those kids. That is so nice,Happy
367,that is super heartwarming. do you know jon stewart?,Curious to dive deeper
367,I do know him. I think he was on The Daily Show correct?,Curious to dive deeper
367,Yeah he is and he was also a very skilled soccer player,Curious to dive deeper
367,I didn't know that. what are your thoughts on Tom Hanks?,Curious to dive deeper
367,I love the guy he is so talented. he is the highest box office star,Curious to dive deeper
367,Yep I agree. He has a lot of awesome movies. I guess he's made almost 9 billion dollars worldwide with his film earnings. That is so much!,Happy
367," Wow, that is insane. nice chat :)",Happy
368," Hello there, do you follow the MLS?",Curious to dive deeper
368," I do, I  think Wayne Rooney is a great acquisition for the leage what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
368,Yeah I think it was good not only for him and his family but for the league as a whole.,Curious to dive deeper
368," I agree, he played at great teams and his an icon of soccer for sure, but there are other great players as well like Ibrahimovich",Curious to dive deeper
368,Yeah I think that has become the new norm is for world class players to end their careers here in the US.,Curious to dive deeper
368," There is also another great player that played before Rooney his name is Roy Wegerle, ",Curious to dive deeper
368,Yeah I guess Roy was a hell of a player.  I guess he played for 5 different english clubs during his career.,Curious to dive deeper
368," He sure was and wat about Eddie Johnson, his been a pro since age 16, he sure has a good level of skill",Curious to dive deeper
368,Yeah Eddie Johnson and Freddi Adu were touted as being the next big things in soccer.  They both had pretty good careers but not as big as hyped up to be.,Curious to dive deeper
368," Well its hard since there is a lot of good players out there, sometimes its just a matter of luck , did you watch the last FIFA World Cup?",Curious to dive deeper
368,Yeah I get so excited each summer the world cup comes around.  How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
368," I did, I thought it was a great World Cup, I was rooting for Argentina but I guess France was the best team of the cup overall, I also liked how Croatia played.",Happy
368," Yeah France had an amazing team and they finally played like it.  Belgium, Croatia, and England did fairly well as well.  I think Japan had some of the most exciting games to watch of all the teams. ",Curious to dive deeper
368," I agree, those teams were also pretty good and almost made it, Im exited about the World Cup thats going to be hosted in Qatar by 2022 and then in the US by 2026",Happy
368,Yeah the Qatar one will be too different for me though.  Watching the world cup in the middle of winter will be strange.,Curious to dive deeper
368," It will be weird I bet the players wont notice it thouhg as Qatar must be really hot even on winter time, its too bad the American soccer team isnt as good in the male category as it is on the female one",Curious to dive deeper
368,Yeah the men's team needed a whole rebuild.  They have years to go before they are anywhere close to where the women's team is.,Curious to dive deeper
368," I agree, the womans team always place third or above, they must have a lot of support from the government",Curious to dive deeper
368,That and I don't think other countries around the world have the women's programs in place like we do here in the US.,Curious to dive deeper
368," Yeah I think they only support mens teams but who know even then the US team might be really great, do you know who Ozil is?",Curious to dive deeper
368," Yeah of course I do, I follow the english league very closely.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
368," I do, I like the premier legue and also the Spain league, well Ozil danated his winning bonus on 2014 to children in Brazil so that they could get surgery",Happy
368," Yeah I remember seeing that, very cool.  Well it was nice talking with you, I hope you have a nice day. ",Happy
369,Hello.,Happy
369,Hey!  How are you today?  Are you an animal person?  I live in Florida so we have a ton of wildlife.  One I don't like is jellyfish!  There is a breed that is immortal!,Surprised
369,I have never seen a jellyfish in person. I love animals though.,Happy
369,I have almost stepped on a few when they wash up on the beach.  Scary stuff.  Fish in general can be scary like the black swallower than can eat prey ten times its weight.,Fearful
369,Yeah and twice its own length. Wonder where it puts it all.,Happy
369," No kidding!  Only one fish has a neck, the seahorse.  That seems crazy to me!",Surprised
369,Did you know freshwater fish only drink water through their skin via osmosis.,Happy
369," I did not know that!  I think as animal lovers we would be happy in Germany.  In 2002, they universally gave animals constitutional rights.",Happy
369,I dont know about taking it that far. Seems like they ma be trying to make up for something over there in germany.,Happy
369," Haha, very true.  That is a lot of animals to give right to!  I do now know how many are in Germany, but there are 20 quintillion individual animals on the planet!",Surprised
369,That is a boat load of animals huh.,Happy
369,I can't even comprehend that number!  It is sad so many go extinct like the dodo bird.,Sad
369,That is sad. Have you heard where hiccups ome from.,Happy
369," Yes, I have actually.  They are a holdover from long ago when the first land animals had both gills and lungs.",Neutral
369,Exactly what I was gonna say. Do you like birds.,Happy
369," I do, we have a ton of those in Florida too!  They can trace birds back to 170 million years ago! Wild!",Surprised
369,Some birds fly from alaska to mexico without sleeping when migrating.,Happy
369,That is a crazy fact!  Probably helps that their bones are very hollow and their skeleton weighs less than their feathers.,Neutral
369,That probably doe help.,Happy
369," Yea, keeps them aerodynamic!",Neutral
369,I really do love birds. Ttyl.,Happy
370,Do you like sports?,Neutral
370," I'm not really into sports, but soccer isn't bad. My friend is obsessed with it and was telling me about this guy Freddy Adu who became pro at 14, I think",Neutral
370,Oh tell me more,Curious to dive deeper
370,Apparently he peaked early though and never really became as great as he could be,Curious to dive deeper
370,That is a shame. Do you watch the world cup?,Neutral
370," No, but my boyfriend has been trying to get me to. He said I should start with women's soccer because the female US team hasn't placed lower than third since they started in 1991.",Neutral
370," Despite the US not being as supportive of soccer as other sports, the us teams have done amazingly well in the world cups as you mentioned",Neutral
370," Yeah, but i think Americans are getting tired of some of the US only sports. Soccer makes more money than football, basketball, baseball and golf combined.",Surprised
370,That is because soccer is the most popular internationally,Neutral
370,I asked my boyfriend why it's called soccer here and he said it was slang for association football in the states.,Neutral
370," Honestly, football and american football confused the heck out of me when I was younger. Calling it soccer made it easier",Neutral
370," Maybe they should just call American football :stupid ball"" and get it over with. I heard the city set to host the fifa in 2022 doesn't even exist yet.",Neutral
370,True many countries want to host despite no immediate economic benefits,Neutral
370," That's really surprising, I heard there are no disceernable economic benefits to host the Olympics either. I guess the whole process is so taxing to the economy and people.",Neutral
370," Perhaps but it also provides prestige, advertisement, tourism, and jobs so I guess it is worth it",Neutral
370," I like that some of the players are altruistic at least, even if sports is mostly about money. I heard a German player donated his 300,000 FIFA win money to help kids in Brazil get surgery.",Neutral
370,That is very generous of him,Happy
370,I heard Jon Stewart was a footballer as well.,Neutral
370,I hope soccer continues to maintain such a healthy spirit despite allegations of corruption surrounding the league,Sad
370,I am sure it will only gain in popularity as Americans start looking outside the country for what's new and different,Neutral
370,I agree. Thanks for your time.,Neutral
371," Hi, do you like wine?",Curious to dive deeper
371," I am not a big wine drinker, I have it occasionally but sometimes it gives me very bad headaches.",Neutral
371,I guess Oregon wine is making a big push to be great! I had no idea!,Surprised
371," I know California is a major wine region, I guess the entire West Coast is a good place to have vineyards.",Surprised
371,Yeah. I really want to do a vineyard tour in Napa. Have you ever been?,Curious to dive deeper
371,No I have not. I will be traveling to Portland this year so I may have to see these Oregon vineyards firsthand now.,Curious to dive deeper
371,Nice. My sister loves a vineyard in Oregon. I cannot remember the name though. She got pretty drunk on it and spent like $500 on a few cases.,Happy
371," I'll have to watch how much wine I have, I don't know if I have enough space in my luggage to bring a few cases home.",Surprised
371," No, she had them mailed to her house! We have different priorities... I do not mind wine in a box. She has ""standards"". Ha!",Happy
371,I believe a lot more wineries are using the box delivery method. I think it saves them money and helps keep the wine fresher.,Curious to dive deeper
371,I think so too. Do you enjoy star wars?,Curious to dive deeper
371,Yes I've watched all the movies. I'm probably not as big a fan as a lot of people. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
371,I do like them but am not a huge fan. I thought I knew a lot but then got humbled by a true fan. They take that stuff really seriously!,Surprised
371," Yes they do, I have heard a lot of them reference stories from outside the movies. I did not know there was so much lore in that universe.",Surprised
371,I had no idea the original lightsaber is in the international space station. Wow...,Surprised
371," That's really cool, I wonder if any of the astronauts have taken it out to pretend to be Luke Skywalker.",Curious to dive deeper
371," I would! I would also keep it secret like they did in empire strikes back, telling the crew lies!",Surprised
371,That must have been great to watch the crew's reaction when the real line was filmed!,Curious to dive deeper
371,I think they have done that with other shows in the past to not give away the ending of finales...,Surprised
371," Yes I have heard that they'll make fake scripts, only allow certain people on set, and put the names of actors on script pages in case it leakes.",Neutral
371,Nice chatting with you!,Happy
372,I'm so ready for daylight savings time and longer days. Did you know that when the Earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long?,Curious to dive deeper
372," interesting, lets talk about the planets more. Most planets spin around the run but uranus rolls around it. ",Surprised
372,That's interesting. Did you know that Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun.,Surprised
372," i did not, there is a planet 455 light-years away that might have the building blocks of life",Surprised
372,That's amazing! As long as it's not the planet where shards of glass rain sideways at 4500 mph!,Surprised
372,Not to mention on that same planet the temperature is 2000 degrees Fahrenheit.,Surprised
372,That definitely sounds like Hell to me!,Surprised
372,Lets talk about Luke Skywalker next. He is played by Mark Hamill and was originally written as a woman.,Surprised
372,That's interesting. I want to book an overnight stay at his boyhood home!,Surprised
372," I would also want to, it only cost $10 but its in Tunisia ",Surprised
372,That would be an amazing stay.,Surprised
372,They kept the relationship of Luke and Vader a secret throughout the filming. The cast and crew did not know the entire time.,Surprised
372," That had to have helped the suspense. Did you know the original lightsaber prop is inside the International Space Station, and was flown by sts-120 in August 2007?",Curious to dive deeper
372,I did not. They hid the secret from the cast and crew and gave them a fake script where it said obi-wan killed his father.,Surprised
372," Wow, what a great scheme! In 1981, Star Wars: A New Hope was dramatized and turned into a 5-hour long radio broadcast. I'd like to listen to that!",Surprised
372,I would also. Lets talk about earth next. its sad to think that more then 80 percent of the earths forest are already gone,Disgusted
372," It is awful. We're destroying this planet inch by inch in the short time we've been here. If the earth's entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds!",Disgusted
372," The earth will be pretty much helium-free by the end of the 21st century, I wonder what happens then. ",Surprised
372,No more balloons.,Happy
372,That's one thing I guess. There is an appointed ambassador to extraterrestrials just in case they want to say hi,Surprised
372," That's cool, I wonder if that was the inspiration for Space Force?",Surprised
372,Maybe. The earth was formed more then 4.5 billions years ago. It was nice talking to you .,Surprised
373,Good Morning! The weekend is very near. Have you got any plans?,Happy
373,Good morning! No I don't as yet.  I'd like to get out and see some stars some night soon.  I don't have a telescope that is all the powerful though. I imagine mine is more like Galileo's telescope.  Do you have plans?,Neutral
373,Not so much yet. My brother is getting married though! so there's that! I am trying to find the right gift for them.,Happy
373,Congratulations!  Have you considered wine for a gift?  I've heard that California chardonnays are very good for challenging perceptions of what wine should taste like.,Neutral
373,My brother and I are not much of drinkers. I do know that wines can have more alcohol content than beer though. like average 14.3%? I feel like we can make an exception on drinking this occasion though.,Happy
373," I think you can.  Some wines go good with food.  There is a wine, La Cabotte Colline Cotes-du-Rhone Blanc that goes good with seafood.",Neutral
373," I have heard of white wine pairing good with seafood, but honestly I'm not sure what food they're going to have. I think maybe pasta or steak?",Curious to dive deeper
373," That sounds good.  I've heard that red wines go good with beef.  I think there is a wine out of Tierra de Castilla, Spain that is said to be a good partner for meat and pasta dishes.",Neutral
373,I might just go with that option. I've always thought of wine to be high-end and expensive but at $18 a bottle its pretty reasonable.,Curious to dive deeper
373," I think it definitely is reasonable and with so many wines out there nowadays price is probably no longer an issue.  I mean, the bottle I was telling you about comes from Spain!",Neutral
373,I like to hear some critics reviews on some wines because of the way they describe the taste of the drinks.,Curious to dive deeper
373,I know what you mean. They make them sound beautiful and perfect.  I know of one that is described to have the aroma of white flowers and have an appealing waxy texture.  I am not sure how wax can be appealing however.,Neutral
373,It sounds like they ate wax sometime in their lives! There's one I enjoyed hearing that said they 'whack you in the face with an oak two by four',Happy
373,Hahaha! I wonder what that means!  I've heard of one that is described to be racy.  I didn't know wine could be racy.,Neutral
373," For the 14th, I'd definitely recommend a Smith-Madrone chardonnay. Critiques say it wraps you in a lovingly warm blanket. ",Happy
373,That does sound nice.  Wines sound romantic and such until you learn where you can buy them at.  Some wines are available at a store called the Wine Outlet.,Neutral
373,It sounds so convenient and easy to decide where to get them from now too. I know they can be ordered online too!,Curious to dive deeper
373," I've heard that too.  It does make it convenient, especially since so many wines are made all of the world such as In Puglia, Italy.",Neutral
373,All these wines from europe sound and im sure theyre good. I think I'd rather support some from USA though. I know california has a few good ones.,Curious to dive deeper
373," Definitely.  Napa Valley California is known for wine, particularly chardonnays like the Smith-Madrone chardonnay.",Neutral
373,I feel like the west coast is where to go. California and Oregon both seem to have the better reviews.,Happy
374,I was reading a factual section about Luke Skywalker and found it very interesting that his role was initially written as a girl,Neutral
374,I had no idea! I also read that the original light saber that he used is in the space station.,Curious to dive deeper
374," thats some cool stuff. It seems to be an extremely well-liked franchise, I personally really like how the writers changed up the script so the secret of darth vader being Luke's father wouldn't be leaked ",Curious to dive deeper
374,I never knew that there was a radio broadcast of the film in 1981.  It would be fun to listen to as a podcast now.,Surprised
374,Agreed! though 5 hours is a little long of my liking lol,Happy
374,I knew that luke was a twin to Princess Leia but i can't keep up with the other relatives and relationships. I would have to binge watch all of the movies.,Neutral
374," that's going to take you a few days to do! It's cool how scientists have discovered a planters that has the ""building blocks of life"". Maybe the star wars franchise depicts what the entire universe would look like in a few hundred years",Curious to dive deeper
374,That would be amazing. The UN made an ambassador of extraterrestrials incase we ever make contact with any. Ha!,Surprised
374," ahaha very true. The UN definitely knows something that the rest of us don't. Seems like an odd job to have, how would you even have the qualifications for something like that",Curious to dive deeper
374," And are they really paid? Who knows? Are you interested in Earth science? Did you know that when the earth was first formed, a day was only 5 and half hours long?",Curious to dive deeper
374," how would you even communicate with ""aliens"", i doubt they would speak a recognizable language lol if they already created this positions maybe we'll have contact with extraterrestrials sooner than we thought. If they came to earth do you think it'd be a friendly visit? and yes I am! so cool!",Happy
374,I have watch enough science fiction movies. It seems that other beings would be more advanced than we are.We seem to not be able to solve global warming. The earth is 71% water and I am afraid the polar ice caps are melting!,Sad
374," yeah thats a common theme i noticed in movies too! They're much more advanced and powerful, yet humans always seem to win the battle some way. But maybe aliens would be chill and would want peace with humans. You're so right, and to think that there are people who don't believe in global warming",Fearful
374,I also read that 80 % of the earths forests have already been destroyed. Very sad,Sad
374,Seems like we're destroying Earth very quickly. the article mentioned that human's existence would represent 1 minute and 17 seconds in comparison to earth's entire history. Yet already we've done so much damage,Sad
374,We really do have an amazing planet in that it sustains life but  there are so many planets in the universe. I wonder how uranus rolls around the sun rather than spins?,Curious to dive deeper
374,Honestly to think about how any of this exists is amazing. have you read that there's a planet with pieces of glass that perpetuate sideways at 4500mph? that almost sounds made up,Surprised
374,That is not something I have never heard. The fact that building blocks of life we detected 455 light years away is difficult to fathom.,Surprised
374,Maybe there's a planet in our universe that also has living life forms. It's interesting how Venus doesn't title so therefore it has no seasons,Surprised
374,Also I had known that Jupiter had moons but that one of them would be considered a planet if it rotated around the sun is pretty cool.,Surprised
374," Funny how the definition of ""planets"" is controversial and how Pluto is technically no longer considered as one",Surprised
374,That involves a lot of updating of text books!,Neutral
374,I guess this is just the natural progression of science. definitions will change and we'll continue to discover new things,Curious to dive deeper
374,It has been nice chatting!,Neutral
374,yes! enjoy the rest of the day!,Happy
374,Thanks!,Neutral
374,thanks!,Happy
375," hi how are you? i think we are back online. Lets talk about the earth, shall we?",Neutral
375,I live on it.,Curious to dive deeper
375," Yes, it is a great place to live! I have lived here my entire life.",Neutral
375," LOL, did you know that the earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century? ",Curious to dive deeper
375,I wonder why that is. where does helium come from and where does it go? we will have to find a solution to that.,Neutral
375,I'm not actually sure. I'm actually not even sure if that is true.,Curious to dive deeper
375," Yeah, sometimes the facts that i encounter in this vicinity of the internet seem a little less than factish. ",Neutral
375," Yup, I can't disagree there. Did you know the UN already has an ambassador to aliens? ",Curious to dive deeper
375,I wonder who decided that was necessary. and how much of the budget goes to cover that job. how do i get that job?,Neutral
375,I'm not sure. It sounds sort of iffy to me.,Curious to dive deeper
375," Yeah, i guess they need a background in science, and maybe a ton of political connections. LOL",Neutral
375," Hilarious, yeah, who knows? Or maybe they are just some weirdo? ",Curious to dive deeper
375," Yeah. ""Hey, that guy is a nutter, but we cant fire him. Alien ambassador? Yeah, he will buy that. give him that job.""",Neutral
375," BINGO! Did you know that when the earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long? ",Curious to dive deeper
375," That is amazing. soon the day will be quite long, if humans are still around. the 20 hour work day. hm.",Neutral
375," Exactly, I already do a 20 hour work day. LOL",Curious to dive deeper
375," Yes, one of the privileges of modern life LOL. Our time on this earth is short, but our work day is not.",Neutral
375,Correct. Did you see the new Wonder Woman movie?,Curious to dive deeper
375," I havent seen it. but i have heard good things. i think that gal gadot is great casting. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
375," Yeah, I haven't seen it either. Nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
375,Have a good evening! lets hope that the server stays up!,Neutral
376," hey there, do you like movies?",Curious to dive deeper
376,I do. I actually saw 50 Shades of Grey with a friend for Valentine's Day in IMAX.,Neutral
376,that was a huge box office hit. do you know who is the highest all time box star?,Curious to dive deeper
376," No, who is it?",Curious to dive deeper
376," tom hanks, and I am not surprised he is a good actor",Curious to dive deeper
376," He is very likable and doesn't take on bad roles, so he should be one of the top earners, even though less skilled actors can manage to do pretty well.",Neutral
376,that is very true. his movies seem to always have a good morale about them,Curious to dive deeper
376,Do you think he would have brought anything to the table in an action film like Wonder Woman?,Curious to dive deeper
376," oh for sure, wonder woman is the highest grossing superhero origin movie",Curious to dive deeper
376," I'd like to see more female-led movies top the box office, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
376,me too. I am excited and looking forward to wonder woman 2,Curious to dive deeper
376,I think it's interesting that the prequels that were released as follow-ups to the Original Star Wars weren't as profitable,Curious to dive deeper
376," I know, I guess everyone just really loved the trilogy ",Curious to dive deeper
376,I'm glad there won't be another trilogy of 50 Shades of Garbage movies haha,Neutral
376," Oh yes, no thank you, I do not see the point of that. did you know that Gal Gadot who plays wonder woman served in the israeli defense forces?",Curious to dive deeper
376," It's always nice to see someone bring some street cred to their art by having real life experience, right?",Neutral
376,of course. and she did not even know she was auditioning for wonder woman,Surprised
376," That's pretty crazy! Some say the Dakota Johnson got her role in 50 Shades through nepotism, but she actually ended up carrying the films.",Surprised
376,You never know I guess what goes on behind the curtains,Surprised
376," Yes, especially on set. Apparently the author of the books and the director of the movie could not agree on a common vision for 50 Shades as a film.",Neutral
376,that must have been tough and taken time to figure out. it was nice chatting with you,Happy
377,DO you follow box office movies?,Curious to dive deeper
377,Yes I do. Do you know who is the star of box office?,Curious to dive deeper
377,Yes it is Tom Hanks with over $8.5 billion overall,Curious to dive deeper
377,Yeah that is awesome. Did you know Disney considered closing their studio once?,Curious to dive deeper
377,Yes after Sleeping Beauty totally flopped in box office,Curious to dive deeper
377," Yeah I am glad they kept going though, they have made some awesome movies",Curious to dive deeper
377,True . Do you know how much Trojan cost to make?,Curious to dive deeper
377,Yes it was a staggering $15 million and made only over $309,Curious to dive deeper
377," That was a huge loss on behalf of the studio, sadly",Curious to dive deeper
377,Yeah. Did you see WOnder Woman?,Curious to dive deeper
377," I did and I really loved it, it was great, and you?",Curious to dive deeper
377,Yes me too. It is the highest grossing origin superhero movie,Curious to dive deeper
377,Yes and also the highest grossing WWII movie too,Curious to dive deeper
377,Yes. And also one of the three top grossing with a female lead,Curious to dive deeper
377,Nice. Did you know Gal Gadot was in the Israeli defense forces,Curious to dive deeper
377,So cool. When she was auditioning she did not know it was for wonder woman,Curious to dive deeper
377,Yes she thought it was for catwoman instead,Curious to dive deeper
377,Yes. Did you know the wonder woman was first introduced as a secretary?,Curious to dive deeper
377,Yes that was back in 1941 but she has made her way through now,Curious to dive deeper
377,Yeah. It was nice chatting with you,Curious to dive deeper
377,Same here and have a good one,Curious to dive deeper
378," Hi, do you like baseball?",Curious to dive deeper
378,yah i like baseball.. what abt u?,Happy
378,I love baseball. Did you know baseball managers wear uniforms because they can technically play if needed?,Surprised
378,ohh nice.. A 3 million $ worth of 1900s baseball cards in his baseball games played each yr,Happy
378,Wow that's crazy. Kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada.,Surprised
378,hmm its also crazy..  what abt shoe?,Happy
378,I like shoes. Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
378,i love shoe.. i have 30 pairs of shoe..,Happy
378,Wow that's a lot of shoes. Marbury promoted a line of shoes that retailed at $15.,Surprised
378,which shoe brand u like?,Happy
378,I love Nike. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
378,i like adidas,Happy
378,Adidas is good too. Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of ballet shoes per week.,Surprised
378,hmm yah.. 5000 yr old shoe perform better than modern shoes,Happy
378,That's pretty crazy. You would think shoes would have gotten better over time.,Surprised
378,what abt Target?,Happy
378,My wife likes to shop at Target. I'm not a huge fan. I think they have expensive products.,Neutral
378,yah i m also think that way..,Happy
378,I agree. I saw Best Buy and Target will price match Amazon.,Surprised
378,I think walmart is littlely low price to compare Target,Happy
378," I agree. Well, it was great chatting with you!",Happy
379," Hi, how are you?",Happy
379,I am good. How are you?  Do you like baseball?  Have you ever heard of their unwritten rules such as if you hit one of our we'll hit one of yours?,Neutral
379," Well, Yes and yes. I do not like the unwritten rules. Seems too unfun... Do you like them?",Happy
379," Some of them seem more like common sense to me.  I mean, not bringing a pet to the batting cage for one makes sense.",Neutral
379," That one does make sense. Mine are more like, pimp your HR trot. Go ahead. Ill be better next time...",Happy
379,I like the unwritten rule of don't eat baked beans before a double header and don't order out for sushi during a rain delay.,Neutral
379," I understand the baked beans, that's common courtesy... But what's wrong with sushi?",Curious to dive deeper
379," I don't know, maybe they think the guy will get sick or something.  The players do do some running to bases and maybe they think that'll slow them down.",Neutral
379,Makes sense. I do hate the rule about stealing when you are down or trying a bunt when you are getting no-hit.,Happy
379,What does the rule say about those?,Curious to dive deeper
379," Don't do those things. If you are down big, you shouldn't steal. If you have not gotten a hit, you shouldn't bunt.",Disgusted
379,I don't think I like those either.  It would seem to me you would want to steal and try to make some runs.  Hey did you know that a team will get three bases if the opposing team catches a ball in their hat?,Neutral
379,I know a ton about baseball but had no idea that is a rule. Thanks for the knowledge!,Surprised
379,I've watched my fair share of games and never knew that till recently myself!  I just thought of some more common sense rules though.  How about don't drop a gum wrapper in the dug out?,Neutral
379,Or be hygienic and don't spit seeds all over the dug out. So gross. Or chew tabacco!,Disgusted
379,I don't think there's much chance of this one:  don't throw an Eephus pitch to anyone named Eephus.,Neutral
379,Who the hell knows someone names Eephus let alone someone named Eephus in the MLB???,Happy
379," I know, right?!  Some of these rules are so odd!  Some I don't understand like don't throw a four seam fastball to a five tool player.",Neutral
379,They need to write these down because I am getting confused...,Curious to dive deeper
379," They really do but these are the ""unwritten"" ones.  I guess you're supposed to just know.  Not wearing a batting glove to brunch is one I would just know.",Neutral
379,Nice chatting with you!,Happy
380,hi how are you? do you like baseball?,Neutral
380," Hi, I think it is fun to learn about. I don't understand why the managers can also be players. That is sort of odd.",Curious to dive deeper
380,that must date back to the day when one of the players was chosen to manage as well. like an onfield boss or leader.,Neutral
380," Oh okay, that makes more sense for sure. The rules can be outdated sometimes, I think. I remember a story about a man who found old baseball cards in his grandpas attic. Being outdated is a good thing then.",Curious to dive deeper
380," yes, those old cards would be worth a lot to someone. i would sell some of them and keep the rest as an investment.",Neutral
380," Yes, the man found out that they were worth 3 million dollars, in fact.",Curious to dive deeper
380," that is wonderful chunk of change! more that you could make just by chatting online with someone, i think LOL Would you sell the cards?",Neutral
380," Yeah, I think I would too. As soon as I hired a police escort to the bank. Baseball is so popular in Japan, did you know that?",Curious to dive deeper
380," yes, i have been to games there. the fans are different, but just as enthusiastic. i recommend going.",Neutral
380," Oh, neat what a fun experience. Yeah I learned that the fans in Japan just can't believe that Americans consider it a passtime.",Curious to dive deeper
380," yes, they are not aware of how big stuff outside of Japan is. they think that 7-11 started in Japan. strange. but now many japanese players are in the MLB>",Neutral
380," Oh wow, what a trip. I think its neat how pro athletes give things and money to causes. For instance some NFL player leave their shoes on the field n order to bring awareness to homelessness.",Curious to dive deeper
380," yes, that is a great way to raise awareness. i wish more athletes did things like that. ",Neutral
380," Me too, it make a real difference. I am a big fan of Target too, lol. I guess just because they price match and I like to shop.",Curious to dive deeper
380," i havent gone there much. it looks like a clean, safe walmart. i guess it is good that they price match.",Neutral
380," Yeah, they have all sorts of thing but havent sold tobacco since 1996.",Surprised
380," yeah, i thought that was strange. there is money in cigs, and people buy them. i guess they felt it was a bad way to make money.",Neutral
380," Yeah, I agree to let people buy and sell what they want to we are free here, its nice. I think they sell ballet shoes there too and I know my daughter goes through 4 pairs a week as a professional ballet dancer.",Curious to dive deeper
380," I would probably go through 10 pairs. I would not be any good as a ballerina. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
380," HA, yeah me too.. I need to find some slippers at Target. They should have a ton available.",Happy
380,Slippers? Ok. I did not know that. Have a great day!,Neutral
380,Slippers are good for watching baseball games on tv. I need to catch up on that New York Giants game today. They beat the Dodgers.,Happy
380,What? Football and baseball? I dont get it.,Neutral
380," Yeah, I don't know why they named them the same either. Good chatting with ya and have a great rest of your day watching all sports, like me.",Happy
381,Hi do you have an Android or an iPhone?,Curious to dive deeper
381," Hi there, I have an iPhone and you?",Curious to dive deeper
381,Nice me too. Did you know women are more likely to own one than men?,Curious to dive deeper
381,I wonder why though. Have you heard of the game Send me to heaven?,Curious to dive deeper
381," I have , that is the game where people throw their phones as high as they can",Curious to dive deeper
381,Yeah and that is why Apple had to get in between and ban the game. Pretty stupid one,Curious to dive deeper
381,Yeah agree. When the iPhone came out Jobs has to have identical ones with him as they kept crashing during the reveal,Curious to dive deeper
381,Yeah that is pretty cool. Microsoft held a funeral for the iPhone when they revealed theirs,Curious to dive deeper
381,Yeah that did not go very well because the iPhone sales have sky rocketed,Curious to dive deeper
381,True. Do you listen to the radio?,Curious to dive deeper
381," I do sometimes, I listen to Pandora and you?",Curious to dive deeper
381," Me too, it is a good one. They have a revenue of #274 million but their net income is negative",Curious to dive deeper
381,Yeah that is strange to me. They now are streaming comedy also,Curious to dive deeper
381,Yeah they are branching it seems. Did you know Swift removed her music from there?,Curious to dive deeper
381,Actually she removed it from Spotify because she does not believe it should be free but kept it in Pandora,Curious to dive deeper
381," Right, not sure if that worked well for her though. Aloe Blacc has 168 million streams in Pandora but only got $12 000",Curious to dive deeper
381,THat is nothing for those millions. Do you play video games?,Curious to dive deeper
381,I used to play Nintendo until it was discontinued in Japan on 2003.,Curious to dive deeper
381,Yeah. Did you know it only has 54 colors?,Curious to dive deeper
381,Wow only 54 ? Pretty awesome for all the fun that it provided us with,Curious to dive deeper
381,Exactly. Do you know who Bill Nye is?,Curious to dive deeper
381," Yeah that is the science guy, I really liked his show",Curious to dive deeper
382,Hi there do you have an iPhone or an Android?,Curious to dive deeper
382," Hi, I have an iPhone. Do you know when the first one was released?",Curious to dive deeper
382," Yeah that was back on 2007, seems so long ago now",Curious to dive deeper
382," I know it sure does. Among users, women are more likely to own one than men",Curious to dive deeper
382,Oh cool fact. Microsoft in fact held a funeral to mark the death of the iPhone when they launched theirs,Curious to dive deeper
382,Wow that did not work very well because the iPhone has had tremendous sales,Curious to dive deeper
382,Exactly. Have you heard of the game send me to heaven?,Curious to dive deeper
382," I did, and Apple banned it because people were supposed to throw the phones as high as possible and risked damaging them ",Curious to dive deeper
382,That is so stupid. When Steve Jobs presented it first he has identical ones hidden because they kept crashing,Curious to dive deeper
382,Yeah it kept running our of ram and that is why it crashed. Those days are over though,Curious to dive deeper
382,They sure are. Do you listen to the radio much?,Curious to dive deeper
382,Yes I listen to Pandora Radio. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
382,Yes me too. Their net income is $-16 million and the revenue is $274 million,Curious to dive deeper
382,Wow that is so strange. Now they are streaming stand up comedy.,Curious to dive deeper
382,That is nice they are diversifying their stream. When Swift removed her music from iTunes she still kept it in Pandora,Curious to dive deeper
382," Maybe that means more of her fans moving over to Pandora, so that is good revenue right there",Curious to dive deeper
382,Yeah that is true. Have you ever played Nintendo?,Curious to dive deeper
382,I have actually. Did you know it only had 54 colors?,Curious to dive deeper
382,Wow that is it? Too bad it got discontinued in Japan in 2003 though,Curious to dive deeper
382," That  is true, I have some fond memories of it. Do you know who Bill Nye is?",Curious to dive deeper
382,Yeah he is the science guy who got his break by winning a Steve Martin lookalike contest.,Curious to dive deeper
382,Haha yeah that is pretty cool. Nice chat.,Curious to dive deeper
383,Do you think electronic devices are having a negative impact on families?,Curious to dive deeper
383,I think they have some negative impact but they also do a lot of good. In my opinion the benefits outweigh the negative aspects.,Happy
383,Do you think it's important to use parental controls?,Curious to dive deeper
383," To an extent, but just to keep harmful stuff that they would be accidentally be exposed to. if I didnt feel my child was mature enough to handle having electronic devices then I would just not let them have them.",Curious to dive deeper
383," Yes, raising kids in the digital age can be tricky, and it is important to encourage them to develop 21st century skills for potential future STEM careers.",Curious to dive deeper
383,That is true. I think kids are growing up a lot differently than i did. I think it will actually make them smarter because whatever they want to know they can learn it right now. If they want to learn rocket science they can start to learn it on the internet today. It wasnt like that when I was a kid.,Happy
383," Some people think that screen time should be managed according to content more than limits, such as an ability for parents to switch between educational and entertainment apps.",Surprised
383," I think it just depends on the kid. you're not going to get a kid that doesnt care about learning new things to learn new things by trying to make them do it. I mean if all they want to do is facebook with their friends all day then you might have to take the phone away, but I dont think forcing them to read a book or try to learn something will work.",Happy
383,This is an area that probably still needs a lot of collaboration between parents and technology companies in order to develop appropriate tools.,Surprised
383,I agree with you there.,Happy
383,I have an iPhone that my kids like to steal from me.,Curious to dive deeper
383,Thats funny. Heres another funny one. Did you hear about the send me to heaven game for iphone.,Happy
383,I did! I wonder if anyone really ever played that! Would not want my kids to play that with my phone!,Surprised
383,No wonder Iphone disabled the app for ecouraging actions that could damage device huh. Lol.,Happy
383," Yeah, you're right! iPhones have come a long way. When Steve Jobs first presented them he had to switch between two iPhones because they would run out of ram and crash.",Surprised
383,I heard that microsoft held a funeral for the iphone when they came out with their first device.,Happy
383," Haha, too bad it did not work! iPhone seems healthier than ever!",Happy
383,I have only had one Iphone before. It was an Iphone 4. I didn't really like it as well as android.,Happy
383,Do you play games on your phone? I don't really though I used to like to play Nintendo.,Curious to dive deeper
383,Not really anymore. I used to play a few but they all got old. Haven't found any I like yet.,Happy
383,The NES was finally discontinued in September 2003 in Japan. I really liked playing mine!,Surprised
384," Hi, are you a tech person?",Curious to dive deeper
384," Hello, somewhat, I enjoy all the advantages!",Happy
384," Me too. I want to know so much more and be better but alas, I cannot.",Sad
384," Yes, Its very exciting on all the new stuff that will be coming out!!",Happy
384,I was surprised to find out that women own more iphones than men.,Curious to dive deeper
384," Really, I didn't know that! That surprises me, I thought it would be about equal. Iphone's have 75 elements in them.",Curious to dive deeper
384,75??? Huh... I feel like iphones are older than 12 years. They came out in 2007?,Surprised
384,I did too. Did you know Apple's app store has 2.2 million applications available?,Surprised
384,That's a ton! I wonder how many are actually active as in kept up or updated? How much egg does Microsoft have on it's face for holding a funeral for the iphone?,Surprised
384," lol, yes, That was since January 2017. I love my Iphone its with me most of the day, like everyone else. ",Happy
384,Ditto! I am reading Steve Jobs' biography and man he was a genius but didn't seem very nice.,Neutral
384," lol, I have heard that before. I heard alot of those guys don't want their kids on the phones and ipads. ",Surprised
384,I dont either and I am pretty sure I am addicted to the dopamine hit I get everytime I open my phone.,Sad
384," True, Do you listen to Pandora?  I see they have a cap on how much you can listen for free.",Curious to dive deeper
384,I do not any more. I hit that cap and then switched to spotify where I pay for the premium service. Do you like pandora?,Curious to dive deeper
384,I too use spotify! I like it better. Did you know that the NFL is legally considered entertainment than a sport like the WWE.,Surprised
384,Really. I had no idea. I wonder why that is?,Curious to dive deeper
384,Must be for legal reasons. I was surprised as well. Who knew? I would say the Iphone holds alot of entertainment!!,Happy
384,So did nintendo. They only had 54 colors!,Curious to dive deeper
384," Yes, I remember that! I didn't realize it had only those few colors. I think I still have it somewhere? lol Good chat!",Happy
384,Ditto. Have a great day!,Happy
385,hey my friend do you like star wars?,Curious to dive deeper
385,Of course!  Chewbacca is my favorite!,Happy
385,yes he's awesome! he's Han Solo's best friend and I always wanted Chewbacca as my friend!,Curious to dive deeper
385,Did you know that various wild animals were used to make his voice?,Curious to dive deeper
385," oh wow I didn't know that, also didn't know that he has a wife and 2 sons, weird!",Surprised
385,Chewbacca does?,Surprised
385," yup he does haha, also there is a fan theory that Chewy and R2D2 are actually secret rebel agents",Surprised
385,Now come on... that's just crazy!!!,Disgusted
385," ya I know, very screwy, pretty funny that in real life there is a bat species called the chewbacca bat haha",Surprised
385,Now i definitely never heard that one before... wonder if it looks like chewie?,Happy
385," ya I want to have a pet bat now! I like that the same actor has appeared as Chewy in all the movies, his name is Peter Mayhew",Surprised
385," Yeah, i did know that and he's like 7 foot 6 inches i believe",Surprised
385," yup the dude is huge, do you have Netflix btw? ",Curious to dive deeper
385,yes i do!  of course :),Happy
385," oh haha I don't have it, I just watch youtube, but ya can't believe blockbuster had the chance to buy them for only 50 million!",Surprised
385,i know... isn't that crazy!  Now there's only one blockbuster store left in the world and it's in alaska,Surprised
385," ya that is sad, and also Netflix is worth like 2 billion, thats a crazy improvement in valuation!",Surprised
385,true... but they are so responsible for the streaming movie industry being so huge!,Happy
385,yup that is true! did you hear the story of how netflix got started?,Curious to dive deeper
385,actually yes... how he tired of late fees and after a... what... like 40 dollar late fee started netfilx?,Happy
385," haha yup that's all it took, Reed hasting got that late fee for Apollo 13 and changed history haha",Surprised
385,Yep... great chat... have a good one!,Happy
386," hi, do you like netflix?",Curious to dive deeper
386,Hello!  I'm a big fan and have had it for years.  What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
386," yes me too, I have an account. Did you know blockbuster too?",Curious to dive deeper
386,I used to go to blockbuster until we started using Netflix.  Can you believe that Netflix tried to get Blockbuster to use it's online service and Blockbuster flat out refused?,Sad
386,Yeah and they mad a bad business decision not buying netflix when they could,Curious to dive deeper
386," Absolutely.  It's so convenient and Blockbuster really missed that.  I wish I could get hired as a ""tagger"" to watch Netflix all the time.",Happy
386,Me too seems like such a sweet gig for sure. Did you know hot netflix got started?,Curious to dive deeper
386,I'm not sure I do.  I'm anxious to hear how.,Curious to dive deeper
386,Reed Hastings had to play a late fee for a rented vhs and got tired of it,Curious to dive deeper
386,LOL.  When I get a late fee I just end up having to pay for it. What's amazing is that Netflix even managed to secure viewing rights for a number of Star Wars movies.  Are you a fan of that franchise?,Curious to dive deeper
386,I am for sure. Well and now netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in north america,Curious to dive deeper
386,I'm sure I'll be adding to those bandwidth #s when I start watching those Star Wars films.  Did you know it's actually in the Guinness World Records for it's film merchandising?,Curious to dive deeper
386,Wow that is amazing. do you know Isaac requested that he be a native of planey yavin 4?,Curious to dive deeper
386," That's so cool.  I love those types of things. For instance, the prequel ""Obi Wan"", Ewan McGregor, has a brother who is a pilot and has the call sign ""Obi Two!""",Happy
386,Nice one. Did you know it was the first major movie dubbed in Navajo?,Curious to dive deeper
386,I didn't know that and it's amazing the influence of that movie.  I guess famed director James Cameron was a truck driver and after watching Star Wars decided he was interested in film and quit his job.,Neutral
386," Yeah there you go. Lucas' wife won an academy award , do you know what for?",Curious to dive deeper
386,Really?  I am curious to know more about that.,Curious to dive deeper
386,She made changes to the original idea of the star wars and that is how she won,Curious to dive deeper
386,Interesting! I wonder if she had any suggestions about the character Chewbacca.  I'm guessing she didn't or he would likely have got a medal at the end of Star Wars!,Disgusted
386," Yeah I bet. Back to Netflix, did you know they spend more money on postage than bandwidth?",Curious to dive deeper
386,What is interesting about that is I was a member back when they sent DVDs to your home.  I didn't realize that postage would still be a big thing for them.,Surprised
386,Yeah go figure. nice chat.,Happy
387,hello do you like chewbacca from star wars?,Curious to dive deeper
387,Hello. I love Chewie!! I think it's awesome that MTV gave him a lifetime achievement award.,Happy
387," Thats awesome!  Well deserved too,  he has done a lot for the galaxy!  lol I recently learned theres a species of bat called chebacca lol ",Curious to dive deeper
387," Is there really? That is so cool. We were at the Krewe of Chewbacchus parade last year. They really nailed his voice, I don't know if they used recordings of wild animals or not, but they were awesome.",Surprised
387,Thats awesome!  Some star wars fans think chewie and r2d2 are rebel agents lol,Curious to dive deeper
387," lol.  Of course, that makes a lot of sense, since Chewie and Han are so close.",Neutral
387,I never knew that chewie has a wife and 2 sons!  Hes a family man lol,Curious to dive deeper
387," I didn't know that either. Peter Mayhew is an amazing actor, and it was a long time before I realized he played Chewie.",Surprised
387," I never knew him until star wars,  what else has he been in?",Curious to dive deeper
387," He was in Dark Towers, back in the 80's and he also voices an animated series, I forget which one. ",Neutral
387," Oh I see,  I guess i never seen those. Have you seen the newer star wars movies?  what do you think?",Curious to dive deeper
387," My favorite of the new ones, is Rogue One. I love that movie. I'm glad it's finally on Netflix, I'm getting tired of watching the fireplace when I can't sleep.",Curious to dive deeper
387," I really liked that one Rogue one,  so I have a Nissan Rogue,  and I named it Jyn lol Netflix is great,  watching anything good ?",Curious to dive deeper
387," lol. I really don't watch much of it, my kids are fond of their original program, The Santa Clarita Diet.",Neutral
387," Oh I actually like that too,  its really funny.  I love the relationship between the parents,  they are so supportive lol ",Curious to dive deeper
387," I'm not a fan of Drew Barrymoore, but she is great in that. I've always wondered how you get a job as a tagger for the company. I can watch t.v. all day long, if I have too.",Curious to dive deeper
387,Whats a tagger?,Curious to dive deeper
387," People who are paid to watch Netflix, and tag content. Kinda like they do on Instagram. Have you seen Lilyhammer? I heard it was good.",Curious to dive deeper
387," No I never knew that,  that is awesome!  I also want that job lol ",Curious to dive deeper
387," I also want the job of monitoring illegal downloads in Europe, so I can tell Netflix which shows to purchase.",Neutral
387,hahaha nice!  Its been great chatting with you.,Curious to dive deeper
388,Did you know horror movies were originally inspired by literature?,Curious to dive deeper
388," Yeah I think classic authors like Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley inspired the genre. ",Curious to dive deeper
388," Speaking of horror films, the movie 'Halloween' made $33.3 million at the box office last October. That's crazy!",Neutral
388," That is, I think it is really hard to make good horror movies, do you like Stephen King?",Curious to dive deeper
388,I do. Do you know the first movie King was ever scared by was Bambi?,Curious to dive deeper
388,That is hilarious!  I wonder why he would say that.,Curious to dive deeper
388,I feel so happy for Jamie Lee Curtis for the success of Halloween,Surprised
388,Yeah I would say that she is the face of that franchise for sure.,Curious to dive deeper
388," Researchers found that out of 1,100 films from 2007 to 2017, only 30% of the main characters were women",Neutral
388," That is very low, I would figure there would be more.",Curious to dive deeper
388,I heard that Halloween is now the second-biggest opening ever for an R-rated horror movie. Do you know what's first?,Surprised
388," That I don't know, maybe one of the recent ones.  I thought the Shining was good, did you ever see that one?",Curious to dive deeper
388," Yes, I loved it. The boy from The Shining, Danny, actually didn't know he was in a horror movie until later on. ",Happy
388," That's what I heard!  That is too funny, I wonder what kind of movie he thought he was doing?",Curious to dive deeper
388,I guess he thought he was making a drama film. Genres can overlap with each other so maybe it is difficult.,Happy
388,Yeah that is definitely true.  Do you know what the thing is called that makes all those metallic sounds in horror movies?,Curious to dive deeper
388,They're made by an instrument called a waterphone.,Curious to dive deeper
388," Good call!  Yeah I wonder if that is the only thing they are used for, like more of a prop just for movies. ",Curious to dive deeper
388," I was wondering the same. With how much money horror films make, it probably isn't needed for anything else.",Happy
388,Yeah they probably just have them waiting in the studio for it.,Curious to dive deeper
388,I just remembered that Silence of the Lambs made $270 million at the box office when it came out. That movie must've been first  ahead of Halloween.,Neutral
388," Holy cow that is a ton of money.  Nice talking with you, i hope you have a good night. ",Curious to dive deeper
389,Hey have you ever seen the movie Halloween? Or even the newest one with Jamie Lee Curtis,Curious to dive deeper
389,I have not. I like her. But I don't really like horror films. Have you?,Neutral
389," No I saw the original one but I didn't see the newest one, my friend side and said it was really bad so I wanted to see your opinion",Curious to dive deeper
389," Ok, I do like SOME horror, but I usually pick and choose. I liked The Shining, The Omen, The Exorcist. Rosemary's Baby. What about you?",Neutral
389," Yeah those are all good movies. I also liked Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street. The new Halloween note took in about $89 in only 3 days, so it was definitely popular",Surprised
389,I haven't seen those. I think that remakes are risky. The comparisons are inevitable.,Neutral
389,Yep it's always hard to beat the original. And yes the new Halloween movie is actually being released on the 40th anniversary of the release of the first one,Surprised
389,I would rather watch the original. It probably has charm. The new one is probably too slick.,Neutral
389,Yeah I think the original is going to be the best. Did you know that Stephen King actually thinks that the movie Bambi should be a horror movie?,Surprised
389," He was traumatized as a child. That movie did have death, so it could be scary. Anyway, he turned his trauma into a career.",Neutral
389,Well that's really good for him! Do you think that horror movies actually burn almost 200 calories per movie? If so I should watch more to lose weight LOL,Surprised
389," I wonder if the effect wears off. No surprise, no tension. I would rather exercise. By the way, do you like horses?",Neutral
389,No I don't like horses I'm actually allergic to them LOL and apparently so is Clint Eastwood,Neutral
389,I have never ridden a horse. I would like to. Is it hard? I figure you have to take lessons or something.,Neutral
389," Yeah you do have to learn, it's actually very uncomfortable even in a saddle, I think it's cool that Dalmatians were used with firehouses in order to calm the horses back before fire trucks",Surprised
389,I've heard that the dogs were deaf. I wonder if that's true.,Neutral
389," I think some Dalmatians are born deaf but not all of them are, what do you think about the high school students who rode horses to school? The high school had a no vehicle policy at the time, and so they rode horses instead lol",Surprised
389," I think they were cheeky for doing so, but I admire their chutzpah.",Neutral
389," Yep I can admire that, I would never have done that as a kid haha. It's interesting that Clint Eastwood was not always allergic to horses but developed it once he hit midlife",Surprised
389," I don't think I have an allergy to them. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
389,Well don't spend too much time around horses just in case you develop a allergy to them LOL I wish I didn't have the allergy,Happy
390,Do you have children?,Curious to dive deeper
390," No I do not, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
390,I do and he seems to be hitting puberty. Moody tween all the time.,Curious to dive deeper
390,Ah I assume that is causing some difficultly. Is there anything in particular he is stubborn on?,Curious to dive deeper
390," He is a great kid, until he plays Fortnite. Something about that game gets him all jacked up and he acts like a different kid.",Curious to dive deeper
390,There have been a lot of studies on video games and it's effect on children. The consensus always seems to be that they use it as an outlet.,Curious to dive deeper
390," I think listening to the way the other people talk and act affects him. He's usually mild and polite, but when he plays with them, he gets very hyper and surly. I also think it's the change in hormones.",Curious to dive deeper
390," That could very well be the case. Hormones seem to do something to susceptibility, at least it was for me as a teen. ",Curious to dive deeper
390," He's also at the awkward, trying to figure out who he is, stage. It's fun to really watch his personality develop.",Curious to dive deeper
390,It's such a weird place to be in the world. They are starting to take on more adult responsibilities but at the same time are still kids in a lot of ways.,Curious to dive deeper
390," Right! He is such a little kid about some things, but he's starting to look at girls differently and it's a weird situation to be in. He used to tell me everything, but not so much anymore.",Sad
390,Wanting to have some secrets its about right developmentally speaking. Just feeling out some small forms of independence.,Curious to dive deeper
390," His voice has also started to change. He is taking after his father with a super low, bass filled voice. It's crazy to hear that low deep voice come out of a kid! I'm wondering what else we are going to be in store for as he changes?",Curious to dive deeper
390,Has he already been through the outgrowing every bit of clothing stage?,Curious to dive deeper
390," He's growing like he's getting paid for it! Every weekend we are going through his clothes and getting rid of what is too small! Especially pants and long sleeve shirts, he has long legs and arms.",Curious to dive deeper
390," Ugh, that has got to be the worst. Even with standard clothing it's got to be expensive and then occasions come up where you need things like suits and you know odds are they are only going to wear it once. ",Curious to dive deeper
390," We are sticking with a lot of khaki pants and nice dress shirts. If he has to have a suit, we'll have to buy it a couple of days before the event, there's no other way to deal with it.",Neutral
390," That is a really smart plan. Forget even trying to tailor it, it will never be worth the cost and time.",Curious to dive deeper
390," I agree totally, tailoring is not worth it at all. I've been lucky with consignments and things so far, but the more he grows and the older he gets, I can't do that as much anymore. I just hope that puberty won't be terribly long as far as the growing is concerned.",Neutral
390,I know thrift store typically had a lot of nicer things for women but you're right the men's selections seems to be lacking. It seems like once a man is fully grown and gets a good suit they never let it go,Curious to dive deeper
390," Absolutely, my husband has had the same sport's coat for years!",Neutral
390," I'm a little envious, seems like women are expected to swap out a new dress for each even. ",Curious to dive deeper
390," Yeah, women definitely get the short end of the stick as far as clothing goes!",Neutral
391,Do you have kids that are around 10 or past that?,Curious to dive deeper
391," I have teens, thankfully both went through puberty without turning into monsters.",Neutral
391," I've have 3 kids that are adults now.  I don't remember this ""monster"" thing.  I think I'm reading the exploits of a snowflake millennial. ",Surprised
391," Mine are gen Z, (early 2000), so I don't have any experience with the 90's millennials. Did you know Apple had a clothing line in the 90's?",Neutral
391," Yes I did.  If this parent need a box of wine for 10  year olds, he/she is in for a big surprise. ",Neutral
391," Meh, it's a blog. They tend to exaggerate for social media. I would love to go to the unclaimed luggage store in Alabama. Maybe I could find mine from several years ago.",Curious to dive deeper
391," Yeah but I don't like it when people make it look like kids are a huge problem even if it's for their own attention.  Yeah, I probably have luggage somewhere in ATL. ",Disgusted
391," If anything, all that does is show your lack of parenting skills...and alcohol problem.",Disgusted
391," Yeah, like that's a good solution -- getting lit. Funny, polo shirts should actually be called tennis shirts because a tennis player invented them.",Surprised
391,I prefer the office attire of Hawaii. Suits and ties are too stifling in that heat.,Neutral
391,Amen to that.  Or maybe a colorful wardrobe full of Pilgrim clothes?  The Pilgrims got a bad rap for always wearing black.  Not true...,Neutral
391,I like the uniform at Billy Mays' funeral. Blue shirts and khaki pants were what the pallbearers were wearing. May as well be comfortable.,Curious to dive deeper
391," Yes, that's cool.  It's going to be OK to wear flip-flops at mine.  I'm a noted tie-hater...",Happy
391,Are you familiar with the theory that the universe is one giant hologram?,Curious to dive deeper
391," Yes, I'm an engineer that wishes he was and astrophysicist.  It's also wild that there may be a region of space that's pulling galaxy's outside the observable universe.  ",Curious to dive deeper
391,I think it's fascinating that there are stars cold enough to touch.,Surprised
391,Does that mean cold fusion is for real?  Some think that there is only one electron in the universe.  That one hell of an electron.,Curious to dive deeper
391," I think it might be, makes you wonder what needs to be revisited in space, or at least give Tycho Brahe & Johannes Kepler a read.",Curious to dive deeper
391,Huge fans of them as I am of Newton.  We lost most of the universe recently in that we don't know what dark matter and dark energy is - it is most of the universe and we can't see it.,Curious to dive deeper
391,Newton built upon Copernicus' works. I need to revisit all of them.,Neutral
391," I admire their accomplishments.  Thanks, you've been a great chat partner! ",Neutral
392,hi how are you? Do you use youtube?,Neutral
392," I do, daily, how about you?",Happy
392,I use it a lot. i listen to old songs and jazz albums. what do you tube on YouTube?,Neutral
392,I mostly watch videos about investing and finance,Happy
392,That is great! a chance to study and learn. i think youtube is a great learning tool!,Neutral
392," yeah, its a great learning tool for sure. Which old songs do you like the most on youtube? 60's 70's 80's 90's?",Happy
392," 70s and 80s, though jazz from the 60s. what about you? what music would you listen to?",Neutral
392,I grew up in the 70's and 80's and I still listen to the music from those decades.,Happy
392," Yeah, great pop and rocks tunes. I enjoy taking YouTube back on a tour of the past.",Neutral
392,yeah I like watching the old comics from that era also. They were way more free then and didnt need to be so PC.,Happy
392," Yeah, they could take more risks, but i guess they were risks at the time. i dont like censorship. i would like youtube to put up warnings but leave the content there.",Neutral
392,Yeah seems like today everyone is so easily offended.,Happy
392," Yeah, well, there is power in sanctimony. WHAT DID YOU SAY??? Im offended!!! LOL",Neutral
392," yeah, I reckon it pays to be a victim. I did not know that police have their own youtube called bluetube",Happy
392,I guess they trade tips on Blutube? I would love to watch.,Neutral
392,yeah probably some good ones on blutube.,Happy
392," the latest weapons, armor, drugs, and vehicles. gangs and stuff. lots of fun. good for writing a screenplay.",Neutral
392,Have you tried Youtube music or TV? wondering what others think of it.,Happy
392," I usually just listen to music on Youtube. i sometimes watch documentaries. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
392,You too! have a good weekend,Happy
392,Have a good weekend too!,Neutral
392,thanks,Happy
393," Hello. Did you know there is a violin made of stone, and it is actually playable?",Surprised
393," Never heard of that. Wonder if it has 4 strings, like normal violins?",Curious to dive deeper
393," I would imagine so. Larry (three stooges fame) also played, I guess he was very good.",Curious to dive deeper
393," Heard he burned an arm as a child, and violion lessons helped strengthen damaged nerves. Was he good?",Curious to dive deeper
393," If WWI hadn't happened, I guess we would have found out, as he was headed to a music school",Neutral
393," I see. Same era: Einstein, already a famous physicist, also played violin exceptionally well.",Curious to dive deeper
393," My daughter has a poster of him above her bed, with the quote ""The Greatest Scientists Are Artists As Well"". She says its inspiration for both her art and music.",Neutral
393," That's great. Have you ever read or seen the film based on the 1902 A.E.W. Mason book, ""The Four Feathers""?",Curious to dive deeper
393," I have not. Is it the one that the judge tried to ban, due to featuring a black character?",Curious to dive deeper
393," Good question. I don't know, but since much of the story is based in the Middle East during 1880's conflicts there, some Arab characters are featured. Could they have been called ""moors"" - or black?",Curious to dive deeper
393," I'm not sure, as I've never read it. I'm more of a sci-fi fan, and love that Poe had a cyborg in one of his stories.",Neutral
393," Edgar Allen, yes. Still re-read his ""Cask of Amontilliado"" story and the poem, ""The Raven"". Ahead of his time, that writer!",Curious to dive deeper
393,Have you checked out the wiki that ranks all of the fictional characters according to their powers and abilities?,Curious to dive deeper
393," No, but interesting feature. Did you know that powerful ruler (for real), Julius Caesar even wrote fiction?",Curious to dive deeper
393,I heard something about him writing about hercules. Have you read it?,Curious to dive deeper
393,Not Caesar's fan fiction. Hercules and Oedipus are main heroes in Greek epics; Caesar would have known about them.,Curious to dive deeper
393," I haven't read much of that, I mainly read travel guides, as I travel a lot. I'm hoping to get to Macinac Island this summer, and bike around the island.",Curious to dive deeper
393," Understand that it is a lovely, slow-paced place. Try a horse-drawn carriage there! Have you, like Caesar, ever been to Greece, through Italy, to Germany or England - or elsewhere in Europe?",Curious to dive deeper
393," I have been to Iceland, it's expensive as I had to travel by plane between towns.",Neutral
393,My son had a stop in Iceland on route to Australia. Wants to go back for a real visit. Understand they have no public rail service there. Too many volcanos and other impassable terrain??,Curious to dive deeper
393," It's a rough terrain, I would love to go back, and am trying to find a cheap flight to Japan (on Iceland Air) for a layover. Japans highways are toll, so it's expensive to travel there.",Neutral
393," Yes, Americans would not accept tolls on all our highways, like the Japanese do. Heard to go across Japan you can expect to pay $300 or more...ouch!",Curious to dive deeper
393," It is very expensive. Thanks for chatting with me, have a wonderful day.",Neutral
394,Hello - how are you today?,Curious to dive deeper
394,I am great! So do you pay attention to politics at all?,Curious to dive deeper
394,I do. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
394,I didn't used to pay a lot of attention but I do now. The country is a crazy place lately.,Neutral
394,I agree. There hasn't been a US president who wasn't a rep or dem since 1853.,Surprised
394," Wow, I guess that doesn't surprise me lol. Did you know the use of RED and BLUE for each party color only began in 2000? Weird",Surprised
394,Oh wow I didn't know that. I saw that Ronald Reagan compaiged for democrats.,Surprised
394," That's odd, he wasn't a Democrat, interesting. i didn't know that.",Surprised
394,Very interesting I think. 15% of the tea party movement identify themselves as democrats.,Surprised
394,Interesting! I was watching a vlog on Youtube who was talking about how many people are not Democrats or Republicans. I agree in that because I don't identify as either.,Neutral
394,Did you know Fox News threatened to sue the Simpsons one time?,Surprised
394," Oh, wasn't that about trying to stop them from parodying the anti democratic agenda?",Neutral
394,Possibly lol. Do you like YouTube?,Curious to dive deeper
394,I love Youtube....I am always looking there or Google to do so many things!,Happy
394,I watch YouTube daily. YouTube is the second largest search engine on the internet.,Surprised
394,That doesn't surprise me. I didn't know this but YouTube operates as one of Googles subsidiaries ...Google bought Youtube for over a billion dollars!,Surprised
394,I didn't know that either. Netflix and YouTube make up half of the peak internet usage in North America.,Surprised
394," Wow, that is huge. I like how the police have their own youtube called blutube lol...pretty smart!",Surprised
394,That is very smart.,Happy
394,I wish we would have had Google and Youtube back in my day it would have been so easy to research and get through school.Kids have no idea how easy having the internet is to help them through so much with info.,Neutral
394,It was great talking to you!,Happy
395," Hello, do you like to travel?",Curious to dive deeper
395," yes, i love to travel. You?",Neutral
395," Awesome,  yes I like to travel too.  I wish we had those high speed buses that the dutch are making,  it travels like 160 mph.",Curious to dive deeper
395,it would indeed be a great pleasure to ride a bus like to work. it would save me so much time!,Neutral
395," Yeah,  and when you ride the bus you can get stuff done too,  instead of driving. ",Curious to dive deeper
395," yes, i think that i would be way more productive on the dutch bus. i should move to holland.",Neutral
395," Yes, that would be better than moving to Japan,  I guess it costs like $300 in tolls to cross the country. ",Curious to dive deeper
395," Yes, japan is far too expensive for most people. i think that it would be good to avoid japan and its expensive highways",Neutral
395," I'm going next Feb.,  so I will avoid driving there lol ",Curious to dive deeper
395,you could take the train there. they have many trains that go around the country.,Neutral
395," Awesome!  Yeah, I like public transportation when traveling its fun. ",Curious to dive deeper
395," yes, it is a good way to learn about a country. public transportation is a cheap and convenient way to travel in a foreign land. i recommend it.",Neutral
395,The first king to travel around the world was the king of hawaii.,Curious to dive deeper
395,he must have had a hankering to see the world and understand other peoples and cultures. i admire his sense of adventure and curiosity.,Neutral
395," Yeah I wonder when he did that,  I cant remember a time where Hawaii had a king lol",Curious to dive deeper
395," I think it was King Kamehameha. he was the last king, i believe.",Neutral
395," I see.  I hear Iceland has no public rail service,  most natives fly across the country.",Curious to dive deeper
395,that makes sense. iceland is very small and perhaps the terrain is not good for rail. planes could be very convenient.,Neutral
395,I hope its not expensive to fly if people have to constantly do it.,Curious to dive deeper
395," yes, they might have high speed buses too. that would be a hoot. LOL Anyway, great chat! ",Neutral
395," Wonderful chat,  thank you so much! ",Neutral
396,Do you like the travel?,Curious to dive deeper
396," Yes, I love to travel! How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
396," Me too, I am planning a trip right now for Brazil! I can't wait. Have you traveled out of the country?",Curious to dive deeper
396," Yes, I have traveled a lot! I even went to iceland last summer.",Curious to dive deeper
396," Nice, that is my future plan, I love the looks of that place. Is it true about their rail system not being there?",Curious to dive deeper
396," I think it is! I heard without cars, they use domestic flights to travel.",Surprised
396," That is interesting, it certainly helps people getting over their fear of flying lol. I wonder if it is because of the terrain",Curious to dive deeper
396,I am not sure. But I do know it is very cheap to travel.,Surprised
396," That is awesome, at least they make it cheap. Have you been to mackinac island in MI?",Curious to dive deeper
396," No, I have not. I heard they don;t have vehicles.",Surprised
396," I heard that too. That would be rough, but at least you would get in shape on vacation lol. Or ride horses.",Curious to dive deeper
396," Very true, you would need a horse-drawn carriage or even a bike to get around.",Curious to dive deeper
396,That would be interesting. It would be more relaxing I think in my opinion. Maybe they will bring the bus from the Dutch that goes 160 mph!,Curious to dive deeper
396,I wonder if people get dizzy looking out of the window.,Surprised
396," I bet, or fear for their lives as they are traveling in a bus going that fast",Curious to dive deeper
396,True. Have you heard about the tolls in japan?,Curious to dive deeper
396," I have, there worse than Chicago's and I never thought that was possible. I don't know how bad they are though",Curious to dive deeper
396,I heard it costs more than $300 to travel across the country.,Curious to dive deeper
396," That is expensive, wow! Probably worth it, but still! It was so nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
396,It was nice talking to you too. I am going to go look into some new places to travel too.,Curious to dive deeper
396,Me too! Enjoy your day!,Curious to dive deeper
397,Hi! Have you ever had to deal with kids going through puberty?,Curious to dive deeper
397,It very difficult to handle. Mostly they playing games and not focused on studies.,Curious to dive deeper
397," I agree. It can cause a lot of anxiety for a parent. Kids get very emotional at that age, and they will argue about anything, even what clothes they wear.",Curious to dive deeper
397,They need mobiles and want to spent the money in the unwanted things. Mostly they are uncomfortable with their studies and teacher. It is very very difficult to handle this situation. They need bike also without drinving license.,Surprised
397,How do you think parents should handle them when they are like this? It is sometimes hard to talk to them about it.,Curious to dive deeper
397," In the kid itself we must follow the rule and regulation, if they enter into puberty it is easy to handle them otherwise, the situation is very worst.",Curious to dive deeper
397,Discipline is a good idea. It can help them get used to behaving well even when they are going through puberty and feeling so many emotions.,Neutral
397," Firstly, we want to be patience and talk to them very polite and spend time with them when ever we are free. while talking with them we make them comfortable.",Curious to dive deeper
397,That is a great idea. Teaching them that we care about them can help them feel like we understand them. Being polite will make us a good example for them too.,Happy
397,They always copy all the habit from their parents only. They are real heroes.,Curious to dive deeper
397," Parents who love their children and raise them right are heroes. It is not easy to deal with children when they are going through puberty, but we all have to do it.",Neutral
397,We should try our best. All in the hands of god only.,Curious to dive deeper
397,Following the example of god is probably a good way to think about raising children. Patience and love will help both parents and kids get through it.,Neutral
397,Yes. Love can change anything in the world. We must be patience too.,Curious to dive deeper
397,I think that it helps to see children grow up after you have cared for them. It feels like a reward to help them and then see them become wonderful adults.,Neutral
397,Its our duty to make them good human and want to serve the society.,Happy
397," That's true. Children are the future of society, so raising them to be good people will make the world a better place.",Neutral
397," In olden days, clothing is refers to cover the body from the sun rays and insects. But now days it was more fashionable.",Curious to dive deeper
397,Clothing is a good thing to talk to kids about too. I also love to shop for clothing for myself. I like comfortable clothes that look good the best.,Neutral
397,You prefer online shopping or went to purchase ?,Curious to dive deeper
397," I like to go in person to purchase so I can try things on. I still like to look around online, though.",Neutral
398,Do you have or have had  kids in that challenging stage of puberty entering.,Curious to dive deeper
398," No, I do not have kids but my parents said that I was tough to deal with in this stage. I was not a well behaved kid. What about you?",Curious to dive deeper
398," I have 3 adult kids.  Only one was a real challenge.  As a parent, it's easy to feel like a failure during this phase.",Angry
398,Did they want all the newest clothing because when I was a kid I made my mom buy me really nice shirts.,Happy
398," My daughter did, not so much with my sons.  Sometimes when as a parent or husband, it's better just to walk of and regroup. ",Angry
398," I would make her buy me shirts that cost 100 or more. Did you know that Mark Zuckerburg the facebook Ceo, wear plain grey T-shirts that cost 300 or 400$",Happy
398," That's nuts.  Mine cost less than $10.  You want nice things for your kids but when it gets ridiculous, stand your ground and don't doubt yourself. ",Angry
398," I really like nice clothing, clothing has always been something people love. Did you know that The greeks made asbestos clothing and it was as valuable as gold.",Happy
398," Sounds itchy... I think it's funny that Pilgrims wore colorful clothes, not just black. Stereotypes... I bet they didn't eat turkey all the time either.  ",Surprised
398," It amazing how traditions get passed along, I even heard about an african tribe that wears victorian cloths because german occupiers they saw.",Happy
398," Interesting.  It's also interesting that polo shirts were actually invented by a tennis player Lacoste nicknamed ""the gator"".",Surprised
398,I feel like people just follow others in their beliefs. Do you belive Isaac Newton and his law of Gravity?,Curious to dive deeper
398,I'm with Einstein in that it isn't a force like Newton says but rather the curvature of space.,Curious to dive deeper
398,Do you think the earth is moving  and flying through space at 500k mph. I have heard new ideas about a motionless round earth with maybe even a dome. Did you know they say the universe makes sounds,Happy
398,We haven't had such ideas since Copernicus.  I thought that was put to bed.  People think what they want like the folks that think the universe is one big superhologram.,Surprised
398," I think our best scientist know less than 1 percent of what there is to know. Some say we all could just be inside of a black whole. I think there is another dimension, like when people take DMT",Neutral
398,That 1% may be a generous estimate.  We've recently lost most of the universe with the unknowns of  dark matter and energy.  There is a theory that there is only one electron in the universe.,Surprised
398," It would be crazy if there is parallel universe, some say there is a cold spot they think could be a link to this universe. Sometimes I think space is all made up. If we are spinning so fast how can the water stay still but that same force can not hold down a butterfly. seems like one big joke sometimes.",Happy
398,Interesting.  I wonder if somewhere some aliens are wearing polo shirts?,Curious to dive deeper
398," I think they are watching us at all times, those sneaky aliens. I wonder if when an alien goes through puberty it is as tough as us humans",Happy
398,Hee.  I suspect that it is.  You've been an excellent chat partner! Thanks.,Angry
399," Hi, how are you on this fine evening?",Neutral
399," hi I'm doing great how about you, did you know Julius Caesar would write fan fiction when he was young, It was about hercules haha",Curious to dive deeper
399,I'm with George RR Martin on this issue. Fan fiction sucks. it is copyright violation. Someone should sue Julius Caesar!,Neutral
399,haha yes! Maybe hercules can prove he is real by suing! I guess Edgar allen poe has the title for oldest example of a cyborg in fiction,Surprised
399," Hercules never understood copyright law! Poe wasn't perfect, but he knew sci fi.",Neutral
399," haha I didn't know that, what did he do?",Curious to dive deeper
399,He married a gal that was like 13 or something. I guess in his day that was not unusual but still. Probably to an author and alcoholic these were normal things.,Neutral
399," ah I see well that is definitely weird, what I'm not surprised with is there is a wikipedia that ranks fictinoal characters, it does it according to their abilities, I'll tell you some people have a lot of time on their hands",Surprised
399," I think that some people live for such things! They get notoriety from such endeavors, but no money. Can you believe that in the 1950s a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it featured a black character? That's an amazing judgement.",Neutral
399," that is pretty bad for sure, what I want to see is the violin made of stone that you can actually play, I play the piano do you play any instruments",Curious to dive deeper
399," I used to play the guitar, but I weren't any good. I would blow hard into it, but it never sounded quite right. Perhaps I should have tried the violin, but I mistook it for a form of violence.",Neutral
399," haha I like that, ya my uncle plays the violin but he says its really hard to learn, the piano isn't that bad in my opinion, it has a good amount of challenge but I think anyone can get pretty good with enough practice",Curious to dive deeper
399," I would like to think that I could be as good as Einstein. He was a musician, but he didn't really gain renown as one. I could do as well as him, don't you think?",Neutral
399," ah I didn't know that, well I think you can do it! just make sure to use modern violins and not the million dollar stradivarius ones, modern ones sound better in blind tests",Surprised
399," I would never be able to tell the difference. Perhaps Einstein could, but I couldn't. If Haydn wrote a competition with the two varieties of violin ar the end, could the audience tell the difference?",Neutral
399," haha good question, what is cool that Einstein said is that ""the greatest scientists are artists as well""",Curious to dive deeper
399," But then again, are the greatest artists scientists? Perhaps not. Or perhaps so. Perhaps I don't know. I want to hear a violin made out of stone, a piano made out of stone for the Flintstones.",Neutral
399," haha I like that, would you ride a bus that goes 160mph? they are making on in Denmark apparently",Curious to dive deeper
399," The Danes are seditious, don't trust them! They lie! They eat too much butter! Anyhows, great chatting with you!",Neutral
399," haha those lying butter eaters! great talking with you, stay away from japanese highways they are apparently all toll roads!",Surprised
399,The pastries in Denmark are dangerously addictive!,Neutral
399," yes that is my dream, to be in denmark, going 160mph in a bus eating pastries!",Happy
400,Hi there. Do you enjoy to travel? I love visiting distant geographical locations!,Curious to dive deeper
400," Yes, I was actually in Paris last week. Do you travel? I was surprised there a website for people with couches to crash on, wish I knew it last week I had a long layover.",Curious to dive deeper
400,Whoa that's awesome! Did you eat crepes? I want to go to Iceland but it sounds like the public transport isn't great-will probably rent a car.,Happy
400," No crepes, I did have snails which I like. I've had a layover in Iceland, it looks like the moon. Flying it a lot of volcanic lava flows turned to rock. Did you know about that gnome stealing thing, take a picture, then return? That a lot of work.",Curious to dive deeper
400,Haha yeah I heard about that. Does sound like a lot of work. Did you fly any domestic flights in Iceland? That seems like a good way to get around there.,Curious to dive deeper
400," No, Iceland Air is cheapest to Sweden, I work there a couple times a year. I'm on the east coast so it's a quick flight though. Do you like fiction, a reader? That how I bide my time.",Curious to dive deeper
400,Awesome lucky. Yeah fiction is entertaining. I like it because it is not based strictly on history or fact.,Curious to dive deeper
400," Yes, I'm not much on Science Fiction, more literary fiction. I didn't know Isaac Asimov coined ""robotics"" I have friends who  love him and Sci Fi. What genre do you like?",Curious to dive deeper
400,Oh nice good genre. I like fiction as well. Edgar Allen Poe's first developed cyborg's in fiction which is pretty cool.,Neutral
400," Yes and Poe developed the detective genre I read too. I read War and Peace, but the Smash Bros is 4 million words even longer? That would take some time.",Curious to dive deeper
400,Wow. Is War and Peace good? I know Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction but I have never read his text.,Curious to dive deeper
400," Yes, I liked it but it's a complex novel. Yes, I read Caesar history of the Gallic Wars. Pretty interesting in light of France now. Do you like music, you see where the highest violin bow price sold for $182,000 wow, that quite expensive per pound.",Curious to dive deeper
400,You have read a lot I'm impressed. I love music and sometimes classical. Hard to believe a violin sold for that. Hopefully it wasn't the one made out of stone!,Curious to dive deeper
400," Gold and tortoiseshell i read, I feel sorry for the turtle. You like fiddle or violin more? Country or classic as the instrument is the same.",Curious to dive deeper
400,Wow. Interesting. I like the fiddle because I prefer country music. A famous scientist who played the violin was Albert Einstein.,Neutral
400," Interesting, complex man. Did you know they have to play and ""break-in"" a violin? That makes sense though interesting it changes the cellulose molecules in the body.",Curious to dive deeper
400,Kind of like a shoe? Very interesting. It is also good for the small muscles and nerves of the arms and hands. Just ask Larry Fine from the Three stooges!,Curious to dive deeper
400," That funny, yes, you like me must have a few years on you. My kids don't know who the Three Stoogies are. Have you traveled much? Back to that, you see where the airlines make the walk longer instead of baggage return quicker to cut complaints. That not good to me.",Curious to dive deeper
400,Yes I have lived in both Spain and Australia. I actually didn't hear about that. Typically airplane if is the most efficient method of travel when compared with everything else so I don't see why they make people walk longer.,Curious to dive deeper
400," Nice, my son went to school a summer in Spain. He loved it. I guess the exercise you get on the longer walk is good. Did you know they fly 10% slower to save fuel relative to the 60's, that would be fine but the food is worse than the 60's too.",Curious to dive deeper
400," Yeah good point. I remember the days when everyone got free meals and they were actually legit. Still given all that flying definitely beats train, boat, and bus travel! Nice chatting with you!",Happy
401,Good morning! How are you today?,Curious to dive deeper
401,I'm doing good! What about you? Do you like to listen to music?,Curious to dive deeper
401," I'm going well too! I do listen to music, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
401," Yes, me too. I like to listen to jazz from time to time. There;'s even a woman in Harlem that has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every Saturday for 20 years.",Happy
401,Wow I wonder how many people show up? I like how Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that tops the charts!,Curious to dive deeper
401," I'm not sure how many show up, but I guess top performers occasionally stop by.",Happy
401,Do you think Clint Eastwood ever did? He is a lifelong jazz enthusiast!,Curious to dive deeper
401," Boy, I'm not sure. I know he scored several films including Million Dollar Baby.",Happy
401," that is so cool! Next time I watch a jazz band, I'm going to see if the trumpeters have goatees!",Surprised
401,Are goatees popular among jazz trumpeters?,Happy
401,Yes it provides them comfort when playing the trumpet!,Surprised
401," Oh, that is interesting Did you know Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that tops the charts?.",Happy
401,That is interesting! But you know what is more interesting? The sun lol.,Surprised
401,Yes! Did you know the sun is actually white?,Surprised
401,I didn't know that! We've been taught the wrong thing all of these years! I do know that the sun isn't the biggest start in our galaxy!,Curious to dive deeper
401," Well, I guess we perceive the sun as yellow because of atmospheric scattering.",Happy
401,That makes total sense to me! I feel like we are spoiled when it comes to the sun's energy!,Curious to dive deeper
401," Yes, the sun produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500,000 years.",Happy
401,That is crazy to think! Are you into reading fiction? Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg! How do people come up with these ideas!,Curious to dive deeper
401,A little bit. I know there's a wiki which ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities.,Sad
401," I am going to go look into that right now. It was nice chatting, have a great day!",Curious to dive deeper
402,Hi There ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;),Happy
402,Hello! Good i just read some really interesting stuff about Jazz music. Did you know it started in the great city of New Orleans?,Curious to dive deeper
402," Yes, I believe I was aware of that fact. Are You a jazz lover ?",Curious to dive deeper
402,I am! It is a great style some people consider it America's classical music today.,Happy
402,Yes sir... I love how every song and solo can sound totally different - even when played by the same musician...,Curious to dive deeper
402,Yes it is truly something. I have heard that New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s.,Happy
402," That I'm not sure about... don't know the exact date, but I always wondered how a music style begins... it's not like a guy is sitting on it's porch and thinks... ""I'm going to invent new music style and I'll call it JAZZ"" :)",Curious to dive deeper
402,Haha! Yeah i have always wondered things like that. But I have heard that Clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast who knew huh?,Surprised
402,I can believe that... he is a classy Dude ;) I don't imagine him listening to disco or rap ;),Curious to dive deeper
402,Yeah he just does not seem like the guy that would be into that. But I think more people love jazz than we know A harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every sunday for 20 years.,Happy
402,I'm sure there were a lot of enthusiasts of that ! Sounds like a good woman,Curious to dive deeper
402,Yeah what kind of stuff is on your mind that you would like to talk about?,Surprised
402,You know Edgar allen poe poetry ?,Curious to dive deeper
402,I am he was a fiction writer correct?,Surprised
402,Yes - really dark poetry sometimes -  He wrote wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction. Pretty interesting ! ;),Curious to dive deeper
402," Yeah he was a special kinda person, If i recall he was the person who also wrote the poem about  the raven crying nevermore.",Surprised
402," Yes I think You're right. Some of his poems were used in ""Nightmare on Elm street"" ;)",Curious to dive deeper
402,Really I had no idea. I wonder how they implemented them in the film?,Curious to dive deeper
402," Those were right before the movie began. Something about dreams - You know, movie related :)",Curious to dive deeper
402,I have not seen those movies in a very long time so it is all kinda blurry to me. But I think I might have to go back and check them out again.,Curious to dive deeper
402,I remember seeing them as a little boy... I was terrified but excited !,Happy
402,Yeah I bet those older movies took lots of inspiration from poes work.,Happy
402," A text before the opening credits starts reads as follows: ""Sleep. Those little slices of Death. How I loathe them"" -Edgar Allan Poe- ( I found it ! ) :)",Happy
402,That is really cool! What one is that from the first one you said?,Curious to dive deeper
403," DO you like Jazz ? There is a lot of people who like Jazz, like Clint Eastwood. ",Curious to dive deeper
403," Yes, Jazz is an art form that has been around a long time. It originated in African- American communities in the late 19th, early 20th century.",Neutral
403," Yeah, it is a recent art, it started to be recognized as an official music current  in the 1920s.  ",Neutral
403,There is a woman in Harlem who has held free jazz concerts at her apartment for 20 years!,Curious to dive deeper
403,I wonder if her neighbors liked it. It must have been noisy.,Fearful
403," I am sure they enjoyed when the top performers came over, would be a treat.",Curious to dive deeper
403,"  It must have drawn a crowd, a crowded apartment is quite noisy.   ",Neutral
403," Yes, jazz is also big worldwide, a Pakistani jazz orchestra is topping the charts.",Curious to dive deeper
403,Would you like it if your neighbor held a jazz concert every Sunday ?,Curious to dive deeper
403," It would depend on how far they are and the noise level, not in close proximity with loud noise.",Curious to dive deeper
403," It is an apartment, so there would a wall between you and the concert. ",Neutral
403," Guess the only way to know is to attend and see what it's like. Did you know that Neptune made a full orbit in 2011, the first since being discovered?",Neutral
403," Yeah, the solar system is quite peculiar, the sun represent 99.86 of all mass in the solar system. Knowing, that losing weight seems futile in the scheme of the universe. ",Sad
403," Yes we are a cosmic dust ball haha, the largest star in our galaxy is 1 billion times bigger.",Happy
403," There is so much that we cannot grasp about the universe until we now enough science, like the sun is white, it is yellow because of our atmosphere.",Neutral
403," Yep, and a lightning bolt is 5x hotter than the surface of the sun, crazy!",Surprised
403,Yeah it is surprising that something on Earth could be hotter than the sun.,Neutral
403," I know right, what do you think about fiction?",Curious to dive deeper
403," I love fiction, I read a lot of stories but I don't write any , unlike Julius Ceasar who wrote stories about Hercules and Oedipus. ",Happy
403," Basically fan fiction, George rr martin doesn't like fan fiction though, but fan fiction may have to finish Game of Thrones at his writing rate.",Angry
403,He could use lawsuits to stop them since his work is copyrighted. Have a nice evening.,Neutral
404," Hey how is it going today, have you heard of the axe-murderer in New Orleans by chance? Scary!",Surprised
404," I  did, I thought that was a terrifying story as well, King Zeno, sure seems like a scary piece",Curious to dive deeper
404," That would be scary to see that guy for sure, it sounds as if he had PTSD, this was apparently a while ago but still, mental health should have been treated a lot better then!",Curious to dive deeper
404," I know right, I wonder if its based on real life events? King Zeno is one hell of a scary novel, not apt for everyone",Curious to dive deeper
404," For sure, it is about a century old but still so scary. Do you like to listen to jazz music?",Curious to dive deeper
404," I love it yeah, what about you? do you like the genre",Curious to dive deeper
404," Not a huge fan but a fan of the historic value of jazz, there's so many types of jazz like swing, Kansas City Jaz, and Gypsy jazz. What other kind of music do you like?",Curious to dive deeper
404," It has deep roots that go almost a hundred years ago, it means a lot to many people, nice tunes and melody",Curious to dive deeper
404," For sure, Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz fan, which is pretty surprising to be honest given his previous roles.",Curious to dive deeper
404," Really his a fan? well he has great musical taste then, I hear Pakistan has a great Jazz orchestra",Curious to dive deeper
404,I would never have guessed that. Have you ever noticed that a lot of jazz trumpeters have goatees? Apparently it is to provide comfort while they play.,Surprised
404,Ive always wondered about those out of style goatees I guess it makes sense to grow them if its for comfort however weird they look,Curious to dive deeper
404," True, it'd be tough to be playing it for so long without anything there I am assuming. You a big fiction or non-fiction fan?",Curious to dive deeper
404," I prefer fiction and just let my imagination fly, do you have a favorite author?",Happy
404," Not really, I would like to check out some Julius Caesar though, he apparently wrote fan fiction about Hercules, would be neat to read that.",Curious to dive deeper
404," That sounds like a great piece of literature, I like George RR Martin, I bet he would dislike the works of Ceasar",Curious to dive deeper
404," It'd be really interesting to just read it, that's almost 2000 years of difference but the same story being told. It's so sad that in the 1950s a judge tried to ban a comic because it featured a black character, what an embarassment.",Curious to dive deeper
404," I know right, luckily times have changed but that kind of behavior makes me really angry, ",Angry
404," Me too, it's terrible to think about people being so willfully ignorant, they have to acknowledge that racism is wrong and it's still here. I wonder what a world would look like without racism, they should write a book on it. I guess it'll be fiction for a while though.",Curious to dive deeper
404," Hopefully one day we will see that, a society free of racism, hate only creates more hat and maybe fiction is the way to make that happen, its sure nice to imagine a world like that one",Happy
404," It would be nice to imagine that world, it better be coming soon. Well I am going to call it a night, I hope you have a great one and take care!",Surprised
404,Lets hope that day comes soon and take care as well have a good night I think im calling it a night as well.,Curious to dive deeper
405,What do you think about the net worth of Kylie Jenner?,Curious to dive deeper
405,I think that she is lucky.,Happy
405," Yeah, she definetely is, although I think that part of her health is actually self made, I think she does work hard.",Curious to dive deeper
405," I would agree, she has worked for it, it wasn't totally handed to her on a silver platter.",Happy
405," Yeah, its crazy how she was 21 when she became a millionare, I like the analogy with Lebron.",Curious to dive deeper
405," yes its perfect. Did you see the police video with ""Uptown Funk""?",Neutral
405," The one of Bruno Mars? I haven actually seen that one, have you? did you like it.",Curious to dive deeper
405," I Havent either, but i love Bruno Mars, his songs are great, I am sure i would like it.  my nephew sings that song, hes 5 its so cute",Happy
405," Yeah he does have some pretty decent songs,Ive heard the Uptown Funk video has over 30 million views, thats crazy.",Surprised
405,I didnt realize that.  I didnt realize that he started out as an elvis impersonator either!,Surprised
405," I saw that on Facebook, did you know that Myspace turned down an offer to buy facebook for 75 million.",Curious to dive deeper
405," no i didnt, haha I bet they are kicking them selves, because facebook basically made them irrelevent. ",Curious to dive deeper
405," They sure are regrettin it lol, specially with the networth of Facebook now a days, I think Mark Zuckerburg is a great entrepeneur.",Curious to dive deeper
405," yes for sure. Did you realize he is red green colorblind, so thats why things are mostly blue?",Curious to dive deeper
405," I didnt know that, I thought it was a marketing thing, I did hear about the Burger king promotion, too bad I didnt spot that one.",Curious to dive deeper
405," yea I never heard about that, but I am not a fan of BK any how ",Neutral
405," I like McDonalds more, but who could turn down a free burger lol.",Curious to dive deeper
405,good point. What do you thing about  Patricia Heaton's support of Kavanaugh?  I think Its great to remember that these people are just people as well.,Curious to dive deeper
405," I didnt really hear about that, could you tell me more about it?",Curious to dive deeper
405,basically there was an article written  and she just pointed out that it was written to show the personal side of him. It was an article that said he was a great dad/ carpool guy.,Neutral
405," Oh I see thats interesting, it was nice chatting  to you, I will definetely use those anecdotes next time Im having dinner with family or friends, interesting topics.",Curious to dive deeper
405,you as well,Neutral
405,have a nice day,Neutral
406,Forbes says Kylie Jenner is a billionaire. I had no idea.,Surprised
406,I did not know that either.  That is crazy.   Do you like space?  I would like to go to Mars someday,Neutral
406," I would love to go to space! Yeah, and they say Kylie Jenner is self made. But I don't think that is true. Supposedly she is the youngest self made billionaire ever.",Surprised
406,Yeah I do not know anything about her.  Did you know there was a dwarf planet between Mars and Jupiter?  I had never heard of it,Curious to dive deeper
406," Kylie Jenner is one of the Kardashians, I believe. I never knew about the dwarf planet between Mars and Jupiter! Does it have a name?",Curious to dive deeper
406,I am not sure of its name.   I do know that the sunset on Mars is blue!  Is that not weird?,Curious to dive deeper
406,That would be pretty neat to see! Sunsets on Earth never cease to amaze me.,Happy
406,Yes they are beautiful.  I love seeing the pictures sent back from Curiosity on Mars - its so sweet it sings happy birthday to itself,Neutral
406,Those rovers are freaking adorable. I have ever thought so.,Happy
406,Yes.  I thought it was awesome that they used aluminum from the world trade centers on spirit and opportunity,Happy
406,It's sad that a satellite was lost on Mars due to a technicality.,Sad
406,Yes.    for sure.  I read about that on facebook.  Do you use that site?,Curious to dive deeper
406,I try not to. Maybe I would more often if we used it for useful things like Iceland does.,Surprised
406,Yes they are rewriting their constitution on it!  How awesome is that,Neutral
406," Very cool, especially that the public can make suggestions and alterations.",Surprised
406,Yes.  It is pretty crazy that 30 percent of Americans use facebook as their primary source of news,Curious to dive deeper
406,Yeah I don't use it for that. Did you ever use Myspace?,Curious to dive deeper
406,I had an account but never used it.  They should have bought facebook when they had a chance,Neutral
406," Right, they could have bought it for only 79 million and now it's worth 104 billion",Surprised
406," I think its funny that the like button was originally going to be the ""awesome"" button",Surprised
406," Haha, that is interesting! And it's funny that the like button is illegal in the German state of Schleswig-holstein.",Surprised
407,Do you use Facebook?,Curious to dive deeper
407," Yes, I do.",Curious to dive deeper
407,You know when they went public they were worth 104 billion dollars,Curious to dive deeper
407," Wow, that's incredible!  I guess Myspace had the option to buy Facebook at one point, I'm sure they've never stopped regretting that decision!!",Surprised
407,I know especially because they would have gotten it for a steal at 75 million. Apparently the like button is illegal in some German country.,Curious to dive deeper
407," That's curious, I wonder why Germany would ban the 'like' button.  That seems random!!  If you lived in Iceland you could contribute to rewriting their constitution - via Facebook!",Curious to dive deeper
407,Yeah that sounds like a good idea or a really bad one. Burger king was trying to get ppl to unfriend facebook friends in exchange for a whooper.,Curious to dive deeper
407,That's crummy of them...and whoever did it!  Apparently Mark Zuckerburg is a little colorblind - that's why Facebook is mostly blue!  I like blue so I'm not complaining...,Curious to dive deeper
407,Yeah seems to work. They make most of there money from advertisement.,Curious to dive deeper
407,Did you know that sounds have a higher pitch on Mars then they do on Earth?  Is the Mars rover equipped with speakers??,Neutral
407," I guess so, lol! Speaking of Mars apparently Bruno writes his own music. ",Curious to dive deeper
407," That doesn't surprise me!  I guess he wasn't good enough for Motown though, they dropped him years before he became a success!",Happy
407," I did not know that or that he was named after a professional wrestler, Bruno Sammartino.",Curious to dive deeper
407," That's funny!  I guess his parents were wrestling fans!!  But I heard his real name is Peter Gene Hernandez, so maybe Bruno is the wrestling fan?",Surprised
407,Yeah looks like he was trying to avoid a stereo type as a Latin pop singer. I don't think it worked.,Curious to dive deeper
407," Maybe a little!  He does have a lot of mainstream success.  In 2023 they're planning on colonizing Mars, they're going to fund it by making it a reality TV show!",Neutral
407,I see! Did you know that Bruno started out as an Elvis impersonator?,Curious to dive deeper
407,That's really neat!  I didn't know that...he reminds me more of Michael Jackson.  But I guess Michael Jackson was obsessed with Elvis...it all checks out!,Surprised
407,Right! Apparently the bands name is The Hooligans.,Curious to dive deeper
407," The Elvis band?  I really like his song ""Uptown Funk"", but I guess everyone does since it topped the charts in five different countries!",Neutral
407,Yeah! No Bruno's band is called the hooligans. You think since he writes his own music he could have come up with a better name but maybe it's just me.,Curious to dive deeper
407," Lol, true!  It was fun talking with you!",Happy
408,hey did you know a robot can now be programmed to debone a chicken?,Surprised
408,Interesting. There is even a robotic arm that a paralyzed woman controls with her thoughts.,Surprised
408," wow that is cool, do you Like Michael Jackson? He wanted to build a 50 foot robot haha",Surprised
408,That sounds pretty wild. I think the mars robots are cute. The Curiosity sings happy birthday to itself on its birthday.,Surprised
408,haha they are cute! did you ever watch Mythbusters? I guess they created a robot sidekick on that show,Surprised
408," I do watch that sometimes but have not seen that episode. I guess the idea of chess playing robots have been around for awhile. Napoleon and Benjamin Franklin lost chess games to a robot, but it wasn't really a robot. A person was hidden inside. ",Surprised
408," haha I remember hearing about that, one thing I'm glad is the US military uses xbox 360 controllers for the eod robots, thats probably cost savings",Surprised
408," Do you worry about robots getting minds of their own? Megatron, a fictional character, was the leader of a civil rights group on Cybertron that wanted equal rights for all robots.",Curious to dive deeper
408," haha yes I would worry about that, especially now they are putting rat brains into robots, that is scary!",Surprised
408,Really? That is strangely awesome. Have you heard of the home robot Amazon is building? I need one.,Curious to dive deeper
408," no I haven't, do you know anything about it it sounds awesome! all I know is amazon actually owns imdb, you know that movie site",Curious to dive deeper
408," Oh, interesting! They are into all types of niches. This project has been many years in the making and it's called the Vesta. We might be able to get it next year, but the robot will likely become a roving Alexa. Unfortunately, it probably won't be a housekeeper.",Sad
408,ah thats too bad because thats what I need! Would you work at an Amazon warehouse? I guess a worker can walk up the 15 miles a day from their shift work,Surprised
408," I would love to work at an Amazon warehouse. I think it might get me into shape! In the future that job will probably be done by robots but for now, it's even hard to train a robot to pick up a coffee mug, a task that is incredibly easy for humans.",Sad
408," haha thats what I think too, and I do wish I were the first person to order on amazon, only $28 and you could have had a building named after you!",Surprised
408,Nice! I think we will see Amazon come out with a factory floor robot sooner than one that has to adapt to a landscape that changes constantly because of dirty laundry and kids clothes.,Curious to dive deeper
408," haha that would be awesome! humans are always evolving though, maybe robots are the next thing, I mean only 200,000 years ago we still had body hair",Surprised
408,And a lot of people do still have an awful lot of body hair. Haha. We supposedly get goosebumps because of an evolutionary trait that was used to make fur stand up and make an animal look bigger,Surprised
408," haha that is funny, it's weird that humans lost the ability to synthesize vitamin c, our gene is defective",Curious to dive deeper
408,And we are the only mammals that cannot breathe and swallow at the same time. Bummer.,Sad
408," haha imagine how cool that would be, that sucks and also sucks to be a human because there is a sound frequency that causes fear in us",Surprised
408,And our history only represents one minute and 17 seconds if earth's entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period. it is sad we are destroying this earth.,Sad
409," hi, do you like robots?",Curious to dive deeper
409," hey! I do like robots, theyre so advanced I guess they can now debone a chicken which is awesome",Surprised
409,that is prettyy cool. And they can be controlled by using rat brains,Curious to dive deeper
409," wow that is crazy, I think its cool the government used an xbox controller to control an eod robot",Surprised
409,Yeah that is. even Michael Jackson had an interest in them,Curious to dive deeper
409," ya its wild he wanted to build a 50 foot tall robot! Like is that even possible? And it would moon walk, sounds awesome!",Happy
409,it does sound very cool. do you ever shop on amazon?,Curious to dive deeper
409," I have used amazon yes, what about you? Did you hear about the clock the owner of amazon built?",Curious to dive deeper
409,Yeah I use it quite a bit. yeah and it is supposed to run for 10 000 years,Curious to dive deeper
409," ya that is crazy, back to robos though did you see that mythbusters actually created a robot sidekick?",Curious to dive deeper
409,No I did not know that. Do you know how amazon got started?,Curious to dive deeper
409," no I don't, I just know that Bezos started it, do you know?",Curious to dive deeper
409,It started as a book store and then slowly he built it up,Curious to dive deeper
409," ah that is cool, I do know they have a special contract to deliver on sunday with USPS",Surprised
409," That is so cool, no wonder they can beat the competition. ANd they even own IMDB",Curious to dive deeper
409," ya, I didn't know that, they bought them in 1998, I use that site everyday!",Surprised
409,Cool. do you know much about humans?,Curious to dive deeper
409," well I do know there is a sound that will cause fear in all humans, its a certain frequency I think",Surprised
409,I would like to know what that sounds like. And we can grow ribs in 2-3 months,Curious to dive deeper
409," ya that is crazy, do you think other animals cna do that? Could we harvest ribs from animals sustainably? haha",Surprised
409,Well that would be kind of nice in medicine for sure. Nice chatting with you.,Happy
410," hi how are you? do you like mars? it is a planet, one of many.",Neutral
410,I think Mars is fascinating!,Curious to dive deeper
410," mars really is a killer planet. it is red, red as all get out. plus it is associated with war. that is cool.",Neutral
410,It gets its name from the God of War.,Neutral
410,that is the coolest god of them all. i would like to get that job. mars is the fourth planet from the sun but it is tops in my book. it might seem small but it is huge to me. would you want to live there?,Neutral
410," Maybe, I hear there is a colonization project planned for 2023",Neutral
410," yes, i want to see who goes there and how much they get paid. it is a crazy job i think.",Neutral
410,Agreed.    Did you hear about the satellite lost on mars?,Neutral
410,yes that was typical of us companies to use the wrong system of measurement. nobody uses imperial except maybe beer makers. maybe the guys were talking about beer? LOL,Neutral
410,Quite possible.  Or distracted by the selfies they were posting to facebook.  Here's me and the rover!  :),Neutral
410," boy, those selfies on mars are really a distraction. i guess the IT guys on mars are never going to hear the end of the problems with the net, since the Cloud is back on earth.",Neutral
410,So very true.  I wonder if the like button would be  legal on mars.  There are parts of Germany where it isnt.,Surprised
410," if germany gets to mars first, they'll probably ban the like button for the entire planet!",Neutral
410,Zuckerburg probably has problems with Mars- he has red-green colorblindness.  Thats why facebook is blue.,Neutral
410,he will spend money to find a cure for r-g colorblindness. or he will upload his consciousness into a machine with better vision. he will prevail in the battle against death.,Neutral
410,Both him and elon musk!,Curious to dive deeper
410,elon will have a secret lab on mars to build his robot army to conquer  the earth. he and mark will have a battle royale in their robot bodies.,Neutral
410,That would be the fight of a lifetime..  Id give the edge to Musk,Neutral
410," good ol musky. he would be a great martian overlord. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
410,You too!  Have a great day!,Neutral
410,Rock on! Have a great day! May the god of war favor you in the battles that come.,Neutral
410,Same to you!,Neutral
411,Are you a fan of Star Wars?,Curious to dive deeper
411," Yea, I love the original 1977 Start Wars",Neutral
411,Me too!  All of the movies combined have made over $8.5 billion at the box office!,Happy
411," That is impressive, I guess that's why Star Wars was named the most successful film merchandising franchise by Guinness World Records",Neutral
411,Oh yea...The entire franchise is estimated to be valued at $65 billion!,Happy
411," That is impressive, I'm surprised that Star Wars is only the fifth highest-grossing media franchise",Surprised
411," Yes!  I agree.  Marcia Lucas, the wife of George Lucas, won an academy award for editing the first movie.",Happy
411," Nice, Marcia Lucas had such a huge impact on Star Wars and made the film better",Happy
411,I agree.  What's funny is that she won that award and George didn't win one for directing!,Happy
411,Yea but he did get to keep the licensing and merchandising rights from fox so he made out pretty good,Neutral
411,Oh yes...smart move on his part!,Happy
411," Yea, 20th century fox really messed up and should of just paid George the 500k directing fee",Neutral
411,Yes lol.  Do you use Netflix?,Curious to dive deeper
411," Yea, I signed up for Netflix a few years after Reed Hastings founded it in 1997",Neutral
411,Nice!  From 9 PM to 12 AM Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in North America.  That's when I watch it!,Happy
411,Pretty crazy despite all the people who stream it Netflix pays much more on postage than bandwidth,Surprised
411,I agree!  Netflx and youtube together make up half of the peak internet traffic in North America.  So basically half of America is online just to watch videos.  lol,Happy
411,Blockbuster must be really kicking itself for not buying netflix for 50 million,Neutral
411,No doubt since Netflix is now worth $2 billion and Blockbuster is down to 1 store.  lol  It's been fun chatting!,Happy
411," Yep, and Blockbuster's $40 late fee on Apollo 13 inspired Hastings to start netflix",Neutral
411,Awesome!  It's been fun.  Have a great day!,Happy
412,Do you like star wars,Neutral
412,Oh yes!  And was happy to see luke skywalker nack!,Happy
412,I still wish he had a bigger part. Some people are saying the last jedi underpeformed,Neutral
412,I don't agree with... I liked it a lot!,Happy
412,We'll just have to hope episode 9 shuts everyone up,Curious to dive deeper
412,I am sure of it!  That's funny George lucas's wife won an acedemy award,Surprised
412,I know and george lucas didnt! But she did have an influence on vital scenes. Including obi wan's death,Surprised
412," Yeah i know, but still :)  That's cool, that they dubbed it in navajo language",Happy
412,I wonder if they still had james earl jones. You cant change vader's voice!,Curious to dive deeper
412,Not really sure! and i soooo agree!,Neutral
412,I think 8.5 billion total revenue makes all the movies pretty successful,Neutral
412,WOW... that's a lot of money!  Love how fox lost billions because they didn't believe in the franchise!,Happy
412,It make Lucas a billionaire! The value of the franchise is 65 billion,Surprised
412,Whoaaaaa!  chaching!  You see some of the star wars are on Netflix?,Curious to dive deeper
412," Yeah, I need to check out Solo. I havent watched that yet. Heard that also was received poorly",Neutral
412,I am sure it is great!  These people are just haters... especially since Disney bought the franchise!,Disgusted
412,We can all agree that Luke Skywalker is the man though! Although he was almost a girl,Surprised
412," Really?  WOW!  Well, glad they went with a guy.  Although Ren is pretty bad ass!",Happy
412,Yeah I cant wait to finish up her story. They kept Vader and Luke's story a secret even from the cast. Giving out fake scrpits. I wonder if they have any of the same tricks up their sleeves,Curious to dive deeper
412,I think it's a great idea and really hope they do!,Surprised
412,There are also a lot of other comic stories I would love to see on the big screen. Hopefully one day. Have a great day!,Curious to dive deeper
413," Hi, how are you doing today?",Curious to dive deeper
413,Well thanks. Are you a star wars fan?,Curious to dive deeper
413," Oh, yes!  I'm a big fan of Star Wars.",Happy
413,The star wars movies have made a combined 8.5 billion dollars. Thats incredible,Neutral
413," Yes, it is.  It holds a Guinness World Records title for the"" Most successful film merchandising franchise.""",Curious to dive deeper
413,Thats crazy. I wonder if Fox regrets giving Lucas the merchandising rights,Curious to dive deeper
413," Ooh, I bet they do big time.  Huge mistake on their part.  I can't believe they thought it would be a flop.",Surprised
413,$500k cost them billions and made George a billionaire himself,Neutral
413,I'm happy for him.  What I find interesting is that James Earl Jones only took 2.5 hours to record all of his Darth Vader lines and only got paid $7500.00.,Surprised
413,That is crazy to think about! And the movie wouldn't be the same without his voice.,Surprised
413," You're so right.  Nobody else could have said,""  Luke, I am your father"", quite like him.  lol",Surprised
413," Speaking of Luke, did you know he was originally written as a girl?",Surprised
413," Yeah, I had heard that about Luke.  Did you know that the original light saber prop used by Luke Skywalker is inside the International Space Station?",Surprised
413,I wonder if the astronauts are allowed to play with it,Curious to dive deeper
413,I very much doubt that. Lol I read somewher that you can rent an overnight stay in Luke's boyhood home in Tunisia for $10.00.  I wonder how many die hard fans have did that?,Curious to dive deeper
413,For only 10 dollars Im sure a lot. Luke is a pivotal figure in the Rebel Alliance,Curious to dive deeper
413," Star Wars fans are a fanatical bunch.  I should know, I'm one.  ",Happy
413,Do you think in todays age the script of vader being lukes father would of been able to be kept a secret like it was?,Curious to dive deeper
413," No, times have changed and integrity and honesty went out the window a long time ago.  You would have to force everyone to sign a ginormous gag order under penalty of imprisonment to keep a secret now.  And even then that wouldn't stop some people from gabbing.",Surprised
413,Have you watched any of the star wars movies on netflix?,Neutral
413," No, not on Netflix, I have boxed sets of all the movies.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you about Star Wars, but I need to go walk my dog.  Talk to you later, friend.",Happy
414,This government shutdown is not looking great.,Angry
414,Not at all.  I saw McCarthy next to Trump often.  Do they like each other?,Neutral
414," Paul McCarthy, the singer? Kind of interesting. Paul is a very common name, ever heard of Paul Ryan?",Neutral
414,Paul Ryan was the speaker of the house.  He left.,Sad
414,Yah. I wonder if he's going to try and run for 2020 election for the GOP.,Neutral
414,I don't know.  By the way McCarthy is House Minority Leader (a republican),Neutral
414,Ahh. that makes a bit more sense.. lol.,Neutral
414,I guess so.  Ryan tried to shore up his power prior to leaving the house.,Curious to dive deeper
414," Definitely, I could see that. Although incumbent typically is chosen to represent the prior winning party, I don't know if the GOP is willing to deal with Trump anymore.",Neutral
414,It is weird.  Why were Ryan concerned about its donors not contributing $$?  He was going to leave anyway.,Neutral
414,It's all about having the funds/access to funds.,Curious to dive deeper
414,for the republican party in general?,Neutral
414,Yes. The republican party needs donors so they can properly campaign. I guarantee that the Democrats will get a bit of pool money this year to campaign. We saw this in the 2018 midterm elections.,Curious to dive deeper
414,Ryan endorsed McCarthy to replace him.,Surprised
414,I thought the current speaker is Nancy Pelosi since they took majority during the 2018 elections,Curious to dive deeper
414," It was in case the republican party won the majority.  Thus, it was decided prior to the midterm.",Neutral
414," Oh i see. Politics, I try to keep up with them but it's just too time consuming. ",Disgusted
414," If you take it too seriously, it could be very stressful.  Jim Jordan wanted to replace Ryan.",Curious to dive deeper
414,Why can't we do what the ancient athens did. Appoint by lottery.,Surprised
414,Why do you think the ancient system (athens) would work?  A republican senator said that last year was a turbulent year in politics.,Neutral
414," Oligarchy is what we are seeing now... Where Ryan wanted McCarthy. Jordan wanted to replace Ryan. If it was random, you could be a president too!",Curious to dive deeper
414,I just want to be able to work and support my family.  I dislike all the fighting related to power and politics.,Neutral
414," If you become president you can end it all. 300K, with a mandate on no more fighting!",Happy
415,Did you know the taller candidate has won the US Election 75% of the time?,Curious to dive deeper
415," I had heard that.  It is an interesting metric to think about when it comes to elections.  I wonder if that accounts for popular vote, or just the election.",Curious to dive deeper
415," I'm not sure, good question. There are 3 subways lines exclusively for congressmen though!",Curious to dive deeper
415,That is kind of crazy.  Did you know Elmo testified before congress?,Curious to dive deeper
415," No, was it a joke or for real? ",Curious to dive deeper
415," Im not totally sure, but I know he is the only non-human to do so.  Maybe Oscar the grouch was causing some problems down in the hood or something.  lol",Curious to dive deeper
415," LOL, I wonder what actor played him? ",Curious to dive deeper
415," I dont know, I always just imagine a stuffed toy or something.  The Congress always plays a Rep vs Dem game of baseball each year.",Neutral
415," Yeah, that is fairly common. It must be a very boring game to watch though. ",Curious to dive deeper
415," I agree.  I imagine they can't be any good, which could make it funny, but in a very sad sense.",Surprised
415,Yeah. Maybe they can put Elmo in! LOL,Curious to dive deeper
415," With the current political colors, he'd have to be on the republican side.  Although they have only been using those since 2000",Neutral
415," Wow, I didn't know that. There is also a fantasy congress, I suppose that is one boring game. ",Surprised
415,A fantasy congress?  Is that like fantasy football?  How would you even get points?,Surprised
415," I'm not sure, but it sure doesn't sound fun. I suppose some people would be into it. ",Curious to dive deeper
415," Definitely not people in Nevada, they actually have a none of these candidates options on the ballot.  I would have loved that one in the past.",Neutral
415,Yeah. Well voter turnout hasn't breached 62.8% in 100 years.,Curious to dive deeper
415," I wonder why that is?  I mean when people are dissatisfied you would think they would be more inclined to vote, unless they feel like their vote doesnt matter due to the Electoral College",Curious to dive deeper
415,I'm not sure. Probably because a lot of people realize their vote won't sway a particular state.,Curious to dive deeper
415," True.  I live in the state that is notorious for messing up elections and counting, Florida.",Curious to dive deeper
415," Yeah, they are always in the news about that. Well nice chatting with you! ",Curious to dive deeper
416," Hello,  did you every us president with a beard has been republican?",Neutral
416," Hi. I just read that, and find that to be pretty funny! That's one of those facts that is fun but meaningless. ",Surprised
416,lol yup useless information.  Just like there hasnt been a us president who wasnt rep or dem since 53.,Neutral
416," So I guess that last time there was a third party candidate that was successful was over 150 years ago. I wonder what the name of the party was? That was just before the civil war, unless I have forgotten my dates.",Surprised
416," Good question,  I am not sure.  ",Curious to dive deeper
416,I wonder if there fact about a republican being elected that wasn't a Nixon or Bush (since 1928) was written before Trump's election? He ran as a Republican and won.,Surprised
416,Not sure. did you know the taller candidate won the presidental election 75% of the time.?,Surprised
416," Yes, I've seen that before, that taller men win more than shorter men. It's funny that Truman wouldn't be photographed in Dumbo the Elephant, since an elephant is the symbol of the Republican party. Another fun party fact!",Happy
416,Yeah thats extreme kinda. lol its Dumbo hes a disney character.  Did you see previews for the new Dumbo live action movie about to come out?,Surprised
416," No! I didn't hear about that. So they will use live elephants? I recently watched the last Disney movie, The Nutcracker and the 4 realms. ",Curious to dive deeper
416," Haha I think the elephants are cgi.  But the actors are real.  I seen that movie,  it was kinda boring in my opinion.",Surprised
416,I know! We were disappointed because we the cg on the previews was great. But the plot and acting were fairly bad!,Sad
416," I know right,  the cgi was awesome,  so colorful and nice.  My daughter wanted to see it and of course she loved it,  we were falling asleep on it lol ",Neutral
416,Maybe that is it! The little kids like it but it didn't come through for adults. Disney  is usually good at reaching both audiences.,Sad
416," Yes usually,  it appeals to adults too. I really liked that movie Inside Out,  that had a lot of adult jokes in it and very entertaining to children. ",Surprised
416," Speaking of your daughter, is she into Elmo and the other Seasame Street characters? I thought it was funny that Elmo testified before Congress!",Happy
416," haha,  she used to be.  Not anymore,  shes into all things princess right now.  That is awesome fact though. ",Surprised
416," I really wonder what he testified about, unless it was to lobby to continue funding PBS or the arts or something in that area?",Curious to dive deeper
416," haha.  I learned that the firsst woman was elected in congres before she even had the right to vote,  weird huh",Surprised
416," Yes, that is very weird and it just really strange to think about how much things have changed in politics and society in general!",Surprised
416," well its been great talking with you,  have a good one. ",Surprised
417,Good morning. Do you follow politics?,Happy
417," Good morning, I'd say I follow some politics, but not too deeply.",Curious to dive deeper
417,Were you aware that the taller candidate usually wins in the election. since 1900 it has happened 75 percent of the time.,Neutral
417," Is that so, maybe I should enter politics, I'm over six feet, I could have missed my calling.",Curious to dive deeper
417,Maybe so. Lol. Did you know that nevada is the only state to have a none of these candidates option while voting?,Happy
417," I guess it's nice to have that option, especially if you have one one your really don't want to vote for, for example, someone who doesn't exactly agree with history textbooks.",Sad
417,On a funnier note. President truman in 1957 refused to have his picture taken with dumbo because he didnt want to be associated with republicans. Lol.,Neutral
417," Media savvy in the days before camera phone and the internet, I would categorize him as forward thinking.",Happy
417,H sure was. Did you know that the use of red and blue for the two major parties was not used until the year 2000. Crazy huh?,Neutral
417," That is the kind of thing you think has been around for ever.  Maybe that is why we only have two major parties, everyone's two favorites colors are taken.",Surprised
417,I think they should just change all of their colors to brown. During the 2012 elections international electoral observrs were blocked from the polls in nine states.,Neutral
417," That would make me suspicious of what is going on there, why don't they want to be observed?  These are the places that end up with animals becoming mayor, or cats placing high on Senate elections.",Curious to dive deeper
417,I would say a cat would be better than some of the politicians. So have you ever played fantasy congress?,Neutral
417,Fantasy congress sound like it is taking the whole fantasy sports thing to far.  I can't see many people sitting in bars yelling at CSPAN because their politician has made the wrong move.,Surprised
417,No janet you were supposed to be against abortion. Lol. I v could see it as well. Sorry about that last message. I dont know what happened there. Did you know that the first woman was elected to congress in 1916.,Neutral
417," Woman are becoming more represented, may one day the Presidential job can be their, whether she is red or blue.",Happy
417,I just dont understand why women couldnt vote but could be elected to congress.,Surprised
417," Maybe it was an oversight of the rule writers, a loop hole so to speak.  Surprising that so many men would have voted for woman back in 1916.",Surprised
417,I am surprised as well. Did you know that elmo once testified before congress?,Happy
417," Elmo, I'd like to have seen how they did that.   What would he have been talking about.  I know Steven Colbert did so too, in character.",Curious to dive deeper
417,Im not a big stephen colbert fan to be honest with you. Do you know that voter turnout or president hasnt crossed 62.8 percent in over 100 years,Surprised
417,In all likelihood it will continue to drop and more people get frustrated with Congress.,Neutral
417,You are probably right on that. Did you know that every president with a beard has been a republican.,Happy
417," Must be in the GOP's rule book somewhere, they have been letting us down on that front over the past few years.  Good talking with you.",Neutral
417,Well its been a good chat but I got to get to work.,Neutral
417," Have a good day, bye.",Neutral
418,Good Morning! How are you today?,Curious to dive deeper
418," Hi, I am good. Do you follow politics?",Curious to dive deeper
418,I like to follow it! Especially when Elmo was the only non human to testify in congress.,Curious to dive deeper
418,That's hilarious. Did you know there hasn't been a president who wasn't a rep or dem since 1853?,Surprised
418," I wonder who it was! If he had a beard, he would have been republican.",Curious to dive deeper
418,Not too sure on that. The last time a rep was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was back in 1928.,Surprised
418,That just blows my mind! I didn't realize that the red and blue colors with the parties wasn't really a thing until 2000!,Surprised
418,I agree. I didn't know that was a thing for such a shot time either.,Surprised
418,I think it's funny what Nevada has printed on their voting options!,Surprised
418,I think so too. Do you know much about Congress?,Curious to dive deeper
418,I try to understand it! I know it kind of started in the 1770s!,Surprised
418,I do too. There are 3 subways line that only congressmen can ride.,Surprised
418,Yet I'm sure they all take taxis! Did you ever hear about Truman at Disneyland?,Surprised
418,I did not. What happened?,Curious to dive deeper
418,He refused to get his picture taken on the Dumbo ride because he didn't want to be associated with Republicans lol.,Surprised
418,HAHA! Did you know there is fantasy Congress game?,Surprised
418," I didn't know that, what is it about?",Surprised
418," Basically, you draft members of Congress and points are based off legislative success.",Surprised
418,I wonder who would be the number one and two pick?,Surprised
418,Not too sure on that. I don't follow Congress closely enough to know that.,Neutral
418," Me neither, I might go look into that though. It was a pleasure chatting, have a great day!",Curious to dive deeper
419," Hi, how are you today? These are 3 interesting articles, don't you think?",Curious to dive deeper
419,I can't believe is has been over 150 since we had a president who wasn't a Democrat or Republican,Surprised
419,I suppose if you want to look at the original strict definitions of what Democrats or Republican party platforms were.,Curious to dive deeper
419,DId you know that every US president with a beard has been a Republlican?,Curious to dive deeper
419,I thought that little fact was amusing but I guess manlyness sell to voters. It just shows that politicians are sensitive to what they perceive are optics.,Curious to dive deeper
419,Do you know when the last a Republican was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was?,Curious to dive deeper
419," I think the last itme was the pair HErbet Hoover & CHarles CUrtis, 1928",Curious to dive deeper
419,I believe you are correct.  How interested are you by politics?,Curious to dive deeper
419," I am very interested as the choices I make as a voter will directly decide how I represented, good or bad. ",Curious to dive deeper
419,Are you sadden by the fact that voter participation hasn't been over 63% in presidential election in the last 100 years?,Neutral
419,I am as there places in the world where people do not have open and free elections. I vote in every election either in person or by mail in ballot. It's my duty as a citizen and my right.,Curious to dive deeper
419,I agree.  I would rather choose my path than have someone chose it for me,Curious to dive deeper
419," Though you can still see how voters can be swayed by things that have little to do with a candidates beliefs, like the beards, or who was a taller candidate.",Curious to dive deeper
419," Yes, for example, How FDR's people never allowed him to be photographed in a wheelchair.",Curious to dive deeper
419," YEs, or Truman refusing to be photographed on the Dumbo ride. I guess optics really do matter, but sometimes, things like Roosevelt's health sham can be harmful to the country.",Curious to dive deeper
419," On a lighter note, are you aware of the annual Democrat vs Republican softball game?",Neutral
419," I am, and I think that is a fun way to blow off steam, with some clean fun bragging rights. In these days of such acrimony, events like that are really needed to show these folks are human.",Curious to dive deeper
419," Yes, the more time they can spend together in a fun setting perhaps they will see themselves more like friends instead of enemies.",Curious to dive deeper
419," I agree and a baseball games gets them out of the office, into the fresh air and on to a level playing field, so to speak.",Curious to dive deeper
419," A level playing field, I like that.  Did you the first woman was elected to congress in 1916 before she can even vote in a national election?",Curious to dive deeper
419,I did not know that but it shows she must have had a strong message to be accepted into the male world of politics even though she could not vote for them herself.,Happy
419," I am not sure if this true for the first woman, but i think quite a few of the early woman were elected after their husbands died",Surprised
419," I have heard of that happening, not everytime, but they still have to be strong enough and savy enough to navigate the system.",Curious to dive deeper
419," True, it must have been tough to succeed in a system where many did not take you seriously",Curious to dive deeper
419," It just shows how todays women in congress and in the senate have had to be tough as nails, yet have a message that can resonate with the people they want to represent and I applaud them. They will bring a new outlook to the old boys club.",Curious to dive deeper
419," Good talking to you, bye",Neutral
420,Hi! Do you follow politics?,Curious to dive deeper
420," hey there yes I do, did you know the republican party was founded in 1854",Surprised
420,I didnt realize that.  I didnt realize that they dominated in the northern states either.,Surprised
420," ya I didn't either, also didn't know that red and blue weren't associated with republicans and democrats until the year 200",Surprised
420,Same here!  I thought those had been around forever!,Surprised
420," I know! It seems like forever since we had a president who wasn't a Democrat or Republican, since 1853 actuallY!",Surprised
420,That is a long time.  Just goes to show you how long the two party system has really been in power.,Neutral
420," yup I agree, we should change how elections are run, did you know that Back in athens a long time ago, they would just do a lottery to elect officials",Surprised
420,I heard that was because they wanted to avoid oligarchy.,Neutral
420," yup you're right, its sad though, the highest voter turnout we've ever had in the USA was 62.8%",Surprised
420,Maybe if there were options like Nevada has people would vote!,Neutral
420," yup but if they are choosing to vote ""none of these candidates"" then your vote is still meaningless haha so whats the point of showing up",Surprised
420," Well, if there was something in place that would require a new ticket if that got so many votes that would be great.",Neutral
420," ya thats a good diea, do you know why the taller candidate usually wins in US elections? That seems weird that they win 75% of the time",Surprised
420," Yeah, maybe people associate height with power?",Curious to dive deeper
420," it must be something primal like that, did you know that there is an exclusive subway line that shuttles congresspeople to different government buildings?",Surprised
420," I heard about those, and the Rep. vs. dems baseball game the congress plays.  That must be hilarious.",Neutral
420," yes they've been playing those games since 1909, the republicans are up by 3 wins overall btw!",Surprised
420,I wonder how many people actually play fantasy congress.  I cant imagine that would be too exciting.,Neutral
420," haha ya that sounds boring, also boring to be there while Elmo was testifying before Congress lol talk about a waste of time",Surprised
420,I wonder what elmo had to say...  lol  Have a great day!  Nice Chat!,Neutral
421," Hello, do you follow politics?",Curious to dive deeper
421," Hi, it's hard not to these days with everything going on in the news.",Curious to dive deeper
421,I agree. Did you know there hasn't been a president who wasn't a republican or democrat since 1853?,Surprised
421," Wow I did not know it has been that long. I really think Bernie should run as an independent and not as democrat. The fear is always splitting the vote, but that happens anyway.",Surprised
421,Yep that's true. Every president with a beard has always been a republican.,Surprised
421,Really? I guess you're right. Of course the gop used to be completely different than the mess they are today. Only recently I discovered GOP stands for grand old party...,Curious to dive deeper
421,Oh wow I didn't know it stood for that either. The last time a republican was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was back in 1928.,Surprised
421," Crazy, although I don't think there will be a Bush in 2020. Did you know when Hillary was in college she was president of young republicans?",Curious to dive deeper
421,That's hilarious. I did not know that about her.,Surprised
421," Yeah, the Republican party was a lot different more recently than people think. In fact Nixon was the only president ever to propose a guaranteed min income. Now people would probably like to reduce min wage to $2 an hour or something crazy. ",Surprised
421,Oh wow I didn't know that either. I saw the red and blue colors associated with each party didn't start until 2000.,Surprised
421,That is crazy. So recently yet it feels like they've always been that way. I think they should change the voting system so the popular vote counts for more.,Curious to dive deeper
421,Yea I'm not too sure what would work these days for the election.,Curious to dive deeper
421," Elections are a mess, not just presidential. A dog has not only won an election for mayor but served as a mayor for 13 years! Dogs don't even live much past 13 lol.",Surprised
421," I agree. LOL - that's pretty funny! During the 2012 US elections, international observers were blocked from the polls in nine states.",Surprised
421,I can only imagine what 2020 is going to be like. Hopefully by then they start allowing you to vote online. I can't imagine it would be that hard. In Oregon elections are done by mail. Online would be a natural progression.,Neutral
421," I agree. Since 1900, the taller candidate has won the election by 75%.",Surprised
421,I guess if you're short it's barely worth running. Subconscious perceptions most likely or it's just a fluke.,Curious to dive deeper
421,LOL yep. I heard that is actually the case for interviews too.,Neutral
421,There are certainly some weird facts. The faster blinker has in debates has lost every presidential election since 1980. I can't see how blinking speed would effect public opinion?,Curious to dive deeper
421,It was good chatting with you!,Happy
422,Have you read Book Club or Fifty Shades of Grey?,Curious to dive deeper
422," No I haven't.  I've seen commercials for both movies and Book Club looks interesting.  I like Diane Keaton, Candice Bergen, and Mary Steenburgen.  Have you read the books?",Neutral
422," I havent, I did see the movies, the Book Club movie was pretty good and Im guessing the book is better, the movie grossed around 12 million",Curious to dive deeper
422,I think Book Club mentions other books such as Moby Dick and Fifty Shades of Grey.,Neutral
422," Well its a romantic comedy novel,  and yeah books like Fifty Shades are referenced in it also Don Quixote, so seems interesting",Curious to dive deeper
422,I think mentioning other literature like A midsummer Night's Dream in the movie can inspire readers and movie watchers to read more.,Neutral
422," I agree that would be a good way to inspire readers specially fans of the novel, do you like to read?",Curious to dive deeper
422,I used to. I just don't seem to have the time any more.  You know what I think is interesting is that the olympics used to have literature as an olympic event up until 1952.  It's a shame they don't anymore.,Neutral
422,It was?  I heard architecture and paiting were events as well but didnt know literature was another one,Curious to dive deeper
422," Yes it was along with music, painting, and even sculpture.  It really seems like back in the day art was valued much more than now.",Neutral
422," It sure was, I think it should remain an olimpyc event, it may not be a sport but it would be interesting to watch, a prize for the best artist",Curious to dive deeper
422,i agree with you completely.  Did you know that Winston Churchill won a nobel prize for literature?  You would think it would be for peace or some other government related event but instead it was for writing.,Neutral
422," I didnt and I agree it does seen odd he must have some pretty good novels or pieces, you know romantic kissing is like a new development!",Curious to dive deeper
422,Is it really?  It seems like something people have been doing since the beginning of time.  Do you know when it started?,Neutral
422," Not sure, but its a recent development according to the article, you know what makes me angry? censoring books like the FDA, they burn down 6 tons of books",Curious to dive deeper
422,That is bad. They must have done that years ago. I don't remember anything recent about burning books.  In today's world even if they did the book would be online so we no longer have to worry about censorship.,Neutral
422," Yeah I agree, its a good thin we have online book stores now but still why burn books doesnt seem like the right thing to do, do you know who Tom Hanks is?",Curious to dive deeper
422,I do know who he is.  Is he a favorite actor of yours?  As far as comedy goes I like bill Murray.  You know he said that kung fu hustle is a supreme achievement in modern comedy.  Weird but funny.,Neutral
422," Yeah he is one of my favorites for sure, he is actually the highest all time box office star and was  over 8.5 billion in earnings, thats pretty impressive I must say",Curious to dive deeper
422," It definitely is. It's much more impressive than the movie Trojan Wars. It had a budget of 415,000,000 and earned only $309 at the box office.",Neutral
422," Wow that is sure disappointing, they only earned $309? that must be a total failure for sure",Curious to dive deeper
422," It must have been. I messed up by the way.  The budget was $15,000,000.  Sorry for the confusion.  ",Neutral
423," How are you? Did u know With over $8.5 billion worldwide film earnings, tom hanks is the highest all-time box office star.",Happy
423," I think I read that somewhere.  I did know however that Even though John Carter was considered a flop for Disney, it did great in Russia, even breaking box office records",Surprised
423,Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty was a box office failure.,Curious to dive deeper
423," Good think it didn't.  If you take inflation into account, the original Star Wars trilogy made more money that the prequels in the US by $1,328,009,800.",Surprised
423,wow thats crazy! The silence of the lambs came out on valentine's day in 1991 and had a box office of over $270 million.,Surprised
423,I didn't know it did that good.  The first game to surpass Hollywood box office sales was Mortal Kombat 2.  I actually saw that one.  I was a huge fan of the game.,Surprised
423," The game was awesome!  Still a classic,  the movie was not that great lol ",Surprised
423," The first one was I thought, but not the second one.  I was surprised to see that the Lord of the Rings trilogy made big losses even though it was a huge box office success.",Surprised
423,Wow thats crazy!!  That was an amazing series!,Surprised
423," I know, I am shocked it lost money.  I am also a humongous comedy fan.  Did you know that Drew Carey was in the Marine Corps for 8 years.  He would tell jokes to his fellow marines.",Surprised
423," Yeah read that too,  i cant imagine him in the marines!  I love his show "" Whose line is it anyway?""",Happy
423," Yes, that is a classic.  I was shocked to see Evan Almighty was the most expensive comedy ever made.  It had a budge of $200 million. ",Surprised
423," Oh right,  I remember reading that.  Thats pretty crazy too,  but it probably all went to cgi,  ",Neutral
423," I bet, but definitely not worth it.  A comedy has not won the Academy Award for best picture in 37 years.",Happy
423,Comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows since its creation in 1989,Neutral
423," Man, the Dave Chappelle show on there was the funniest show EVER in my opinion.  Check this out.  In 1981, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was nominated by the writers guild of America for its best comedy award.  Strange. ",Surprised
423," lol it definitely had some comedy aspects! Bill murray thinks kung fu hustle is ""the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy"".",Surprised
423," I read that somewhere.  I was surprised to hear that.  I know in early comedy, slipping on a banana peel was meant to mean slipping in horse manure.  ",Neutral
423,Really?  Thats hilarious!,Neutral
423,Yes it is.  I am a fan of Satire comedy as well. That is when comedy is used to portray people or social issues as ridiculous or corrupt.,Neutral
423," good talking to u,  have a good one!",Neutral
424,Hi. Do you like comedy?  I didn't know until recently that comedy originated in ancient greece.,Neutral
424," ya I do like comedy, I like that Drew Carey got his start doing comedy when he was in the marines",Surprised
424,I didn't know that. I had no idea he was in the marines!  The greek that comedy was two groups against one another in an amusing conflict.,Neutral
424," yup, comedy is cool it was founded in ancient Greece which I didnt know",Surprised
424," It's got to be hard to do too.  I mean, comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989.",Neutral
424," that is crazy, its funny too the first comedy film was a guy slipping on a banana peel to fall into horse poop haha",Surprised
424," It is funny.  I'm guessing it was an old film and even still today that would be funny!  Hey,did you know that ancient greece did political satire and it influenced their voters?  Sounds a lot like today's world.",Neutral
424," that does sound like today, I like parody best though, it subverts your expectations and critiques without condemning",Happy
424,I like that too.  It seems nicer.  Everyone has their favorite though.  Bill Murray thinks kung fu hustle is the supreme achievement of modern age comedy.,Neutral
424," haha I do like that movie, have you seen Evan Almighty?",Surprised
424,I think I have. Is that the one with Jim Carrey?,Neutral
424," that was Bruce Almighty, this one was actually the most expensive comedy ever made",Surprised
424," Are you serious?  There are so many others out there I would think would be just as expensive if not more.  I wonder if it did any good.  Trojan Wars had a budget of $15,000,000 and only earned $309.",Neutral
424," haha weird, also weird its been 40 years since a comedy won best picture",Surprised
424," That is weird.  Everyone likes comedy but I guess since everyone's tastes are different it's hard to single one thing out for an award.  Then again, tv shows are different.  3rd Rock from the Sun won best comedy series in 1997. It beat out the greats- Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier.",Neutral
424,I like all those shows! did you know empire strikes back somehow was nominated for a comedy award back in 1981,Surprised
424,No I didn't know that! I don't see how that could be considered a comedy at all.  That reminds me of the movie the green lantern. It was going to be a comedy originally.,Neutral
424," haha that movie was horrible, did you ever see MOrtal Kombat 2?",Surprised
424,No I didn't see that.  I know a little about it though. Isn't it from a video game?  I don't know who is in it but I know it's not Tom Hanks. He's the highest all time box office star.,Neutral
424," ya Mortal Kombat 2 was the first game to make more than the hollywood movie based on it, so the game was good but the movie was unpopular",Surprised
424,That's funny and awful at the same time!  It's like Disney's Treasure Planet.  It's one of the most expensive failures ever.,Neutral
425,Hey how often do use the internet? I know that I'm using it right now haha,Curious to dive deeper
425,I use it really often and Im using it right now as well lol so a lot,Curious to dive deeper
425," Well I personally like clicking on hamburger buttons, they're the buttons that are made of three horizontal lines,+ the name makes me hungry",Happy
425," That makes me hungry as well, crazy how only 7% of the people read the terms on a service or product on the net",Curious to dive deeper
425,Yeah I know that I never read them haha. If you went on Mount Everest would you take a selfie at the top? Apparently they have 3-g service there,Surprised
425," That would be great, taking a selfie in the top of the tallest mountain, I didnt know you could get addicted to the internet",Curious to dive deeper
425," I did know that, I'm probably addicted right now haha. And yes if you use the internet too much you can get addicted to clicking links",Surprised
425," That is just crazy, its a good thing there a copy stored in the library of Alexandria, I cant imagine my life without the internet now",Curious to dive deeper
425,No I agree with you. I wonder how often they back it up at the Alexandria library though? Do you believe that there is extraterrestrial life in the galaxy?,Curious to dive deeper
425," I do, we are not alone in the world, the universe is so big that there must be alien life in other planets, galaxies",Curious to dive deeper
425,Yes I think you're right. Have you heard of the Drake equation? It's an equation that calculates the probability that life exists outside of hours in the universe and I think that it has determined that there should be life there somewhere,Surprised
425," No havent heard of it, and then I agree with that equation, there are firefighters that are trained on how to treat aliens in case of a crash or an invasion",Curious to dive deeper
425," Well that's pretty cool. Did you ever hear of the show X-Files? Apparently in that show aliens began to colonize Earth back in 2012, so maybe they already are here haha",Curious to dive deeper
425," I used to love that show, and who knows maybe they are I try to keep an open mind about that",Curious to dive deeper
425,Yes it's best to keep an open mind. What do you think about Tom Cruise? Did you know he built a 10 million dollar bunker in his basement to protect him from Aliens LOL,Surprised
425," I think he is a great actor, he definitely has the money to do that, I think his a bit too paranoid though",Curious to dive deeper
425," Yep it seems like a really weird thing to buy, have you seen the movie Aliens though? Apparently those aliens were based off of deep sea creatures",Surprised
425," Wow, those creatures must be really scary Im guessing you also like astronomy right?",Curious to dive deeper
425," Yes I definitely like astronomy, what about you? Did you know that after they created Wi-Fi, they were able to use that technology to improve astronomy and imaging in outer space",Surprised
425," That is amazing, I dint know that but I can see how the net has improved many things, astronomy one of them",Curious to dive deeper
425," I agree, do you like Bill Nye the Science Guy? Apparently he is the executive director of the planetary society which is an astronomy organization",Surprised
426," Did you know in the ""x-files"" aliens begin their colonization of earth on December 22, 2012?",Curious to dive deeper
426," I had no idea! I've never watched the show, but I wonder if it gives you tips on what to do in case of an invasion? I understand there are some firefighters that are trained to treat aliens.",Curious to dive deeper
426,I used to watch the show. Pretty weird that Tom Cruise has a $10 million underground bunker to protect himself from aliens.,Curious to dive deeper
426," It is curious. I mean, since the leader of his religion is an alien, as I understand it, you'd think he'd be okey doke with aliens.",Surprised
426," Crazy, what religion is he? ",Curious to dive deeper
426," Scientology. It's a mix of sci-fi and self help, with a nice dose of pyramid scheme added in. ",Neutral
426," Oh yeah, I've seen shows on that. That is crazy. I wonder if they could make a franchise out of that similar to the Alien's movie franchise. ",Curious to dive deeper
426," With aliens from the deep? I'd love that. Of course, the Scientology aliens come from volcanoes, which is a whole other...thing.",Surprised
426,That would be a pretty cool movie. They could even have a cameo from Bill Nye the science guy!,Curious to dive deeper
426," Aw, he's the best! He's the executive director of the Planetary Society! I love astronomy.",Happy
426,I used to watch his show a lot. Did you know that the Ancient babylonians had a sophisticated understanding of astronomy?,Curious to dive deeper
426," I'm not surprised. Once you observe the sky regularly, you start to see where everything is. I'd like to go to the place in Iran they call astronomy town. They've cut back on light pollution to see the sky better. ",Curious to dive deeper
426,Interesting. Were you aware that only 7% of people read the ToA for a product off of the internet. Seems a bit high to me.,Curious to dive deeper
426," That seems like an optimistic number! I don't think I've ever read it. Now, if the library of Alexandria has a copy of the internet saved, does the internet have a copy of all the things in the library of Alexandria?",Curious to dive deeper
426," Interesting, the wayback machine might actually have that.",Curious to dive deeper
426," I'd forgotten about the wayback machine! I hope my old website hasn't been saved. Though it's nice to know that I could read it from atop Mt. Everest, if I had to. Can you imagine being up there and wanting to be on the internet?",Surprised
426,I would never climb up there. I'm scared of heights. But that is interesting that there is 3g service up there.,Curious to dive deeper
426,I wouldn't either. It's amazing how interconnected our lives are because of the internet. The whole world was reshaped because of it.,Curious to dive deeper
426," yeah, that is pretty cool. But the internet is addictive. ",Curious to dive deeper
426,It certainly is! I just want to click through everything and learn just enough things to be a know it all.,Surprised
426,I think a lot of people do. The longest name in the world is a story about a shepherd apparently.,Curious to dive deeper
427," Hi what arts do you enjoy? Music, Literature, etc?",Neutral
427,Hello - I enjoy it all. Did you know Linkin Park played 324 concerts in 2001?,Surprised
427,That is amazing. Even the ramones who toured for 20 years only played like 100 per year,Neutral
427,Yea that's pretty amazing. I love Linkin Park.,Surprised
427,Also that is almost one every day. Must have been incredibly taxing,Neutral
427,I bet. In Croatia there is an ancient amphitheater that is still in use as a venue today.,Surprised
427,Isn't there also one in pompeii? I believe pink floyd performed there,Neutral
427," Yes, I've seen the Pink Floyd performance in Pompeii. ",Happy
427,Do you mean the recording? I believe that had no audience on site,Neutral
427," Yes, I saw the recording of it. ",Happy
427,Did you like it?,Neutral
427,Yea it was pretty good. Do you like poetry?,Curious to dive deeper
427,I enjoy my fair share. There are many different types of poetry though,Neutral
427," Yes there is a lot. There is a poem when read normally is depressing, but when read backwards, is inspiring.",Surprised
427,That in itself is inspiring. Much like saying there is two sides to every story,Neutral
427," Yep. The Japanese alphabet, when recited in order, forms a poem.",Surprised
427,Are you familiar with palindromes?,Neutral
427,I am not. Do you know a lot about them?,Curious to dive deeper
427," Palindromes are a series of words that are the same read forward or backwards. Understanding that, you must understand how hard it must have been for Demetri Martin to write a 224 word palindrome poem.",Neutral
427,Oh wow ok. I bet that was a challenge then!,Surprised
427," Indeed! In any case, thanks for chatting.",Neutral
428,Do you like concerts?,Curious to dive deeper
428,Sometimes don't really get out much though. What kind of concerts?,Curious to dive deeper
428," I like the Ramones to be honest, what about you? ",Curious to dive deeper
428,Everybody loves Raymond!,Curious to dive deeper
428,Hilarious. Do you play violin?,Curious to dive deeper
428," Nope, i don't play any instrument. Do you?",Curious to dive deeper
428," I play guitar, piano, and drums. I grew up playing mozart, no lie. ",Curious to dive deeper
428,Wow that's awesome. I do love music though. I mostly listen to instrumentals. Violin and electric guitar sounds great together.,Curious to dive deeper
428," Yeah, they are great. I didn't know that some violins could be upwards of $1 mill. ",Curious to dive deeper
428,That's ridiculous especially since modern violins were preferred to Stradivarius ones when blind tested.,Curious to dive deeper
428," What about poetry, do you like it? ",Curious to dive deeper
428,Well i use to write a little when i was younger. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
428,Not really to be honest.,Curious to dive deeper
428,There is a poem that when read forward is depressing but when read backward is inspiring.,Curious to dive deeper
428,Did E.E. Cummings write it?,Curious to dive deeper
428,Not sure who wrote it but i would like to read it. Did you know that Linkin Park played 324 concerts in one year?,Curious to dive deeper
428," I did, they were good. ",Curious to dive deeper
428,Yeah i like them too. shame how things went down. Wow i didn't realize that law suits could be filled if a concert was  bad.,Curious to dive deeper
428," Yeah, I heard about that with Creed. They aren't the best, in my opinion. ",Curious to dive deeper
428,Yeah not like Pink floyd!,Curious to dive deeper
428,Nice chatting with you.,Curious to dive deeper
429,Hello! Are you interested in poetry at all?,Curious to dive deeper
429," Hi! Poetry is ok, not really my thing. I read poems in school. Nowadays, I don't. I prefer novels. You?",Curious to dive deeper
429,I didn't love poetry either! But I do like individual poems. There's a poem that read normally is sad but becomes inspiring when read backwards.,Neutral
429," That's great! Words can be depressing or uplifting depending on their order. Edgar Allan Poe only received $9 for the publication of ""The Raven."" I wonder if he got royalties.",Neutral
429," That's surprising! I'm sure he got compensated somehow. I think words can be beautiful when orchestrated properly. Once I read a 224 word long poem, that turns out to be an entire palindrome!",Happy
429,HOw long did it take to write that poem? It sounds like something that would require a computer. I wonder if it's a pretty poem.,Curious to dive deeper
429," I'm sure it must have taken forever. On the other hand, the Japanese alphabet is naturally a poem when recited in order.",Surprised
429,I think you mean the Javanese alphabet. The Japanese alphabet wouldn't work. Do you get a chance to go to concerts much?,Curious to dive deeper
429," Oh I think you're right! And I do sometimes! I saw Linkin Park in 2001, I thought it was very unique until finding out they had almost 324 concerts just that year.",Sad
429," They were on a tear, weren't they. I think they must have made a ton a cash that year. The following album must have had high expectations. I couldn't tour like that.",Neutral
429," Oh I'm sure it must have been exhausting. Then again imagine the Ramones, they played 2,263 concerts total over 20 years, that's insane!",Surprised
429,The Ramones must have discovered the secret of youth. How could they maintain that pace? Their fans must love them.,Neutral
429,I'm sure they appreciated them like crazy for doing that. On the other hand I remember there was a Creed concert that was so awful that people actually filed a lawsuit against them.,Neutral
429,Creed must have done something so bad for their own fans to sue them. Did they won? Does it matter? I hope they learned a lesson.,Neutral
429," I have no idea, I'd guess they didn't win. Maybe it was the fault of the theater and not Creed? Like there's an ancient Roman amphitheater in Croatia, I bet the acoustics there are awful.",Curious to dive deeper
429,I bet it wouldn't matter for Creed. They would get sued no matter where they played. I wonder if the Ramones ever played in Croatia.,Neutral
429,Well I know Pink Ployd recorded a live concert at a different Roman amphitheater in Pompeii! Then again there was no audience so who knows how good it really was.,Surprised
429," It was probably ok, but was it necessary? Why that amphitheater? Then again, they were artists. Who knows what they want.",Neutral
429,Yeah people have interesting choices for sure. Have you ever been to a violin concert?,Curious to dive deeper
429," I have been to the symphony, but not concerts for violins specifically.",Neutral
429,Neither have I! But I think it would be an experience for sure. There's a musical piece where artists gradually leave the stage until only two violinists are remaining.,Curious to dive deeper
429," That's interesting. I wonder what it sounds like. Very modern, I suppose. I wonder what a violin made out of stone sounds like. It probably ""rocks"" pretty hard.",Curious to dive deeper
429," Haha definitely it would be nice to see that at a concert. Anyway, it was nice talking to you, have a nice night!",Curious to dive deeper
430," Hi, how are you? Do you like to use the Internet?",Neutral
430,Hey. Yes I love the Internet. They carry so much information and resources and services.,Happy
430," i worry about the internet. i think that it could be addictive and that i might lose myself in it. the clicking, the constant clicking.",Neutral
430,That is definitely a valid concern. What is weird is that humans are the minority on the Internet outnumbered by automated software programs.,Surprised
430,i did not know that. we are monitored all the time. even these very chats that we do could be handled by bots in the future. then what?,Neutral
430,Yes that's a good question I'm not sure what would happen then. One cool thing is that in Finland everyone has the right to an Internet connection.,Happy
430,i think that is great. people need to be connected for work and school and also to make friends. maybe not bot friends though.,Neutral
430,Agreed. When people look themselves up on the internet it is called egosurfing. I wonder if bots egosurf lol?,Curious to dive deeper
430,that would be funny. comparing themselves to other bots. the narcissstic bot. that would be their downfall,Neutral
430,Yeah it would! What is crazy is that astronauts in space have faster internet than most american homes!,Surprised
430,that would make sense to me. i guess they need a speedy link to send and receive data. do you believe in extraterrestrials?,Neutral
430,Yeah true. I do although we have never made contact. Even the ancient greeks wrote stories about them!,Surprised
430," i guess the skies seemed mysterious to them too. what is up there past the stars? they must have wondered. i figure that one day we will make contact, but not the way we expect.",Neutral
430,Yeah I don't think we will. The president of the world chess federation believe chess was invented by aliens. That is certainly an odd theory lol.,Curious to dive deeper
430," why aliens? it is not such a strange game. simple pieces, simple board, simple moves. complex strategy.",Neutral
430,Yes my thoughts precisely. Well at least we are prepared. The UN has a contingency plan just in case!,Curious to dive deeper
430,I dont have too much faith in that. the UN doesnt speak alien. And they would probably protect themselves.,Neutral
430,Yeah agreed. Maybe the USA needs its own plan? The sequel to charlie and the chocolate factory has aliens!,Surprised
430," What? that is strange. Aliens in a chocolate factory? Why? I guess the kids like aliens? Why not zombies? Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
430,Haha yes I question that same thing. They are all hypothetical life forms indeed. You have yourself a good rest of the day now.,Neutral
430," Thanks, you too. Take care!",Neutral
430,Bye now! Also the vatican owns its own observatory. I wonder if its secretly for finding aliens...,Curious to dive deeper
431," Hello, do you like Astronomy?",Curious to dive deeper
431," I do, but do not follow it closely.  I did have the good fortune of seeing the 2012 annular eclipse when I was on a consulting assignment in Utah.  And you?",Curious to dive deeper
431," I also enjoy it when I can.  A while ago, ancient babylonians understood astronomy so well, they were able to track planets with mathematical precision! ",Curious to dive deeper
431,Its amazing that they were able to do that without the modern optics and computers we have today.  It seems the interest in astronomy is so great that even the Vatican has an observatory!,Curious to dive deeper
431," I went to the Vatican a few years ago, and did not know that!  Wi-fi was actually a byproduct of research into improving astronomy imagery.",Curious to dive deeper
431,I doubt the younger generation would know how to live without WiFi.  They seem to live their life on the internet via social media.  Did you know that Finland has made access to the internet a human right?,Curious to dive deeper
431," I did not know it is a right in Finland! I agree with too much reliance now.  I don't know how many will need this, but there is 3g service and internet capabilities at the peak of mount everest.  So you can take the selfie up there before passing out.  ",Curious to dive deeper
431," LOL.  What amazes me is how people assume they can do anything, even on their employer's internet!  Did you happen to hear about the criminal investigation that shut down the Sunspot Observatory in NM?",Curious to dive deeper
431," I remember when that was going on, didn't hear too much why initially.  I know there were theories of Aliens?",Curious to dive deeper
431," Well, it was not E.T downloading illegal materials; it was the janitor!  I am glad the facility director got the FBI involved.",Disgusted
431,Definitely glad the FBI got involved!  That janitor claimed someone been entering there to steal their internet service!  Lol I don't think E.T would stop there now!,Curious to dive deeper
431," Thankfully that is over and the observatory is back up and running.  And, I hope they have upgraded their internet security!  Do you think there is life out there that we do not yet know about?",Curious to dive deeper
431," I do think how vast the galaxies are, that there has to be life somewhere else!  In the X-Files aliens started to colonize Earth in 2012.  That hasn't happened yet!",Curious to dive deeper
431,I find it interesting that the U.N. already has a contingency plan in the event aliens do make contact.  People have been fantasizing about forever; an ancient Greek wrote about plant like aliens on the moon over 1800 years ago!,Surprised
431," Wow that is a long time ago, and where humans were thinking about that!  Tom Cruise believes in aliens, he built an underground bunker to protect himself from E.T.",Curious to dive deeper
431," Tom Cruise may be a popular actor but he also has very unique beliefs!  Perhaps aliens are already here spying on us!  Did you know that humans are a minority  on the internet, being outnumbered by bots? Perhaps some are there collect info for their home world? LOL",Curious to dive deeper
431,Lol!!  I did not know that!  Starting to get me thinking now!  I do know I am one of the 7% that do try my best to read the full terms when buying something on the internet.  lol,Curious to dive deeper
431," I buy from a few online vendors who's terms I have read.  While I may find a cheaper price at an unknown ecommerce site, is it real and what are the terms.  Online, I do occasionally play chess with other players from around the world.  Did you know the president of the world chess federation believes that chess was invented by aliens?",Curious to dive deeper
431," No I did not!  Seems like a lot of people out there believe in alien life!  Well anyways, it was nice talking to you!  Have a great day!!",Happy
431," The internet may have a dark side, but I like the positive things it has done, like facilitating the sharing of knowledge.  I like using the online star charts to help understand the night sky from time to time.  I might do that tonight!  Take care...",Neutral
431,Thank you you also!,Curious to dive deeper
432,Hi!  Are you a fan of cats?,Neutral
432," Yea cats are awesome, in japan and taiwan they have cat cafes where you can have drinks and pet cats",Happy
432,That is pretty cool.  It is crazy to think that when a cat reaches 15 years old it has spent 10 years of its life sleeping.,Neutral
432,Sound like the life to be able to be able to sleep 10 years out of 15 like cats too,Neutral
432," They are pretty lucky that way.  There is a cat that is published, but only because a physicist listed him as the co author so he could write in first person.",Neutral
432,Lol thats pretty cool but not as cool as Talkeetna Mayor Stubbs,Neutral
432,Mayor Cat?  Hmm...  hed probably put nap time as mandatory.  I could get behind that.,Neutral
432,He has been a mayor since 1997 so he has spent at least 10 years of his tenure sleeping,Neutral
432," He probably has, that is crazy.  I wonder how that happened?",Surprised
432,Maybe there is a large feral cat population up there,Neutral
432,That is partly how the cat in the opening scene of the Godfather was a stray on the set.,Neutral
432," Yea there are a lot of cats, the only pet with higher numbers are fish",Neutral
432," Kinda crazy, to think that there are that many cats in the world.",Neutral
432,Theres a lot of cats and they are successful in many environments despite of 80 percent of the earth's natural forest being destroyed,Neutral
432,I know for the short time humans have been on earth we have certainly destroyed a lot of the earth.  There wont even be any helium left at the end of the 21st centruy,Fearful
432," I wonder what is causing the earth to be helium-free by the end of the century, i guess there won't be many ballons left",Curious to dive deeper
432," True, we should probably conserve that now.",Neutral
432," Maybe the UN should try to do something about, sounds more important than appointing an official ambassador to extraterrestirals",Neutral
432,I wonder if that position will ever be used.  I would feel somewhat silly telling people that is my job.,Surprised
432," An extraterrestrial ambassador sounds like a sweet job, or a good bar story",Neutral
432,You could win tons of bets.  Tell people you have the most outlandish job. Wins everytime,Neutral
432," lol i guess so. Well i got to go, nice talking with you",Neutral
433," Hi, how are you? What do you think of this planet of ours?",Neutral
433," Hello, Great! Its very interesting!! Its upsetting about our natural forests being destroyed!",Curious to dive deeper
433,Ithink that we will destroy them all within the next 100 years. We cannot slow down. We want more and more,Neutral
433," Could be, very sad! I hope not though.",Sad
433,Soon we will run out of helium. Earth will be virtually helium-free by the end of the 21st century. Where will it all go?,Neutral
433," I know, where? Interesting when the earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long!",Surprised
433,Now it's longer and getting even longer. Soon the workday will be 20 hours. I will retire then.,Neutral
433," lol, good idea!! We have a time change on the 10th of March!",Neutral
433,I totally forgot. I guess that I will lose an hour of sleep. Doh.,Neutral
433," Yeah, spring forward.  Do you like superhero's like Wonder woman?",Curious to dive deeper
433,I like Wonder Woman. I did not see the recent film. I heard it was good.,Neutral
433," I didn't either, Gal Gadot was unaware she was auditioning for wonder woman, she thought it was for cat woman!",Surprised
433,That's great! She looks like Wonder Woman. She is in great shape and has the look.,Neutral
433,I think so. She's perfect for the part! I do like cat woman though too!,Neutral
433," She would do well in that too. When wonder woman first appeared as a member of the justice society in 1941, the group made her their secretary. That is pretty sexist! But typical for the day.",Neutral
433,I was thinking the same thing! In 1953 Winston Churchill won a Nobel prize in literature.,Curious to dive deeper
433,I guess he was good at telling stories. I never knew that. He was quite a leader. I guess I should check out his works.,Neutral
433," Yes, he was half American and half British! ",Surprised
433," Yes, I believe he got honorary citizenship or something. I dont remember. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
433," Yes, have a good night!! Good chat!",Neutral

433,You too!,Neutral
434," Hi, how are you?",Happy
434,im great! how are you? do you like snakes?,Neutral
434,Not really. I could move to new zealand and never see them again. What about you?,Happy
434,i dont like snakes but i dont hate. they are to be respected. they are part of nature,Neutral
434,There is a genus of flying snakes! Nope!,Fearful
434,That would be a hard no for me too. dang nature why you so scary LOL Crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to snakes and lizards. i guess i could move to australia,Neutral
434," Australia's got crazy too! I remember a story of huge birds dropping dead out of the sky. Or maybe they were bats. Anyways, huge flying things falling from the sky!",Fearful
434," yeah, lots of scary things there. crocodiles are pretty scary, but they are not related snakes LOL",Neutral
434,Humans are not the only ones afraid of snakes. Monekys are too!,Fearful
434," monkeys are smart, they know what is dangerous! i bet a lot of creatures are afraid  of snakes.",Neutral
434,I wonder if they can tell the difference between snakes and legless lizards.,Curious to dive deeper
434," i bet they dont care. they fear anything that is close. i know i would! by the way, do you go to concerts much?",Neutral
434,I do. Do you go to concerts much?,Happy
434,I used to go quite a bit when i was younger. now i dont really go. no time or money.,Neutral
434,I do not like the crowds any more. I like smaller venues and local music.,Happy
434,i dont like crowds either. not very intimate. i do like sitting near the stage and seeing the musicians up close.,Neutral
434," I am more of a bar guy at the bar, just listening and relaxing.",Happy
434," yeah, i hear you. music to unwind. not dealing with crowds and hassles. would you ever sue a band for a bad performance? i wonder how mad i would have to be.",Neutral
434,Are you talking about Creed? I remember that on the news and I laughed out loud because that is something I can see scott stapp doing.,Happy
434,they must have sucked incredibly to drive people to a lawsuit. they probably should have practiced a bit before touring.,Neutral
434," He got stupid drunk before the show, passed out after 15 minutes, and then the show ended. Once he was sued, he called it performance art. Such a waste...",Sad
434," thats terrible. the guy has a drinking problem and needs help. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
434,Ditto! Have a great day!,Happy
435,Hi do you like Wonder woman movie,Happy
435," Yea, Patty Jenkins did a great job directing Wonder Woman",Neutral
435,Yes pretty good one in the DC universe,Happy
435," Yea, Gal Gadot was a perfect casting choice to play Wonder Woman",Neutral
435,Yes she is perfect. during audition she was not aware that she is auditioning for Wonder woman,Surprised
435,I never knew that. I also didn't know Wonder Woman's first film appearance was in the Lego Movie,Surprised
435,Gal gadot has seved in israel defence force . I thought she was paegent queen,Surprised
435,That is pretty cool. Did you know Wonder Woman was the justice Society's secretary in 1941?,Neutral
435,no but it was the highest superhero origin movie. may be marvel movie may break this record soon,Surprised
435,Probably. Do you read literature? It used to be an olympic event,Curious to dive deeper
435,Yes had read few .  but FDA has burned 6 tons of literature in act of censorship. I dont think that was a good act,Sad
435," That is very strange, not as strange as the heavy metal as a form of literature course taught at Texas A&M",Surprised
435,not they are in electronic form and burning is not that easy poor FDA,Surprised
435," That is odd, I wonder if it had to do with the recent development of Romantic Kissing in literature",Curious to dive deeper
435,do you know that Winston Churchill won a nobel prize for literature,Surprised
435," No, I figured he would win for peace, not literature",Neutral
435,some things are hard to believe . Earth;s day was 5.5 hrs long when formed,Surprised
435," That's pretty crazy, plus earth's magnetic field reverses every 200,000-300,000 years",Surprised
435,Gravitional interaction between Earth and Moon gradually slows its rotation,Surprised
435," Crazy, did you know earth is 4x as dense as sun? well nice talking with you",Curious to dive deeper
435,. We even have a ambassador for extra terrestrials .Nice talking to you,Surprised
435,Have a good one,Neutral
436,Do you like poetry?,Curious to dive deeper
436," I'm not too into them. I heard that Ursula K Le Guin who is known for her science fiction and fantasy novels, finshed a collection of poetry before her death.",Curious to dive deeper
436,Wow i did not know that. Did you know that Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome poem?,Curious to dive deeper
436," Interesting! Le Guin, in her poem ""Normal"" talks about not feeling bad to crush others to achieve goals. But the poem wanted to demonstrat that we should not let destructive attitudes prevail",Curious to dive deeper
436,ok. You know how much the famus author Edgar Allen poe received for the publication of the raven?,Curious to dive deeper
436," It was $9. Depressing! Speaking of depressing, there is one  poem that when read normally is depressing but read backwards is inspiring.",Surprised
436,Wow that's one i would like to read. Have you ever seen the movie the hobbit?,Curious to dive deeper
436,I think I have. There is a book of poems by Emily Jungmin Yoon that seems quite depressing-it is about Korean comfort women in WWII in Japanese occupied territories.,Sad
436,Wow that most be a heart wrenching read. I asked about the hobbit because almost all the characters are named that were taken from an old Iceland poem Dvergatal.,Curious to dive deeper
436,Nice. Some poetry that i would like to learn more about is the javanese alphabet. It actually forms a poem when recited in order,Surprised
436,Now that is unique. Poetry has a long history dating back to prehistoric times.,Curious to dive deeper
436," Oh, how far back do they go?",Curious to dive deeper
436,Well in Africa they used it while hunting.,Curious to dive deeper
436,Very cool. It seems humans have always used poetry to explore a deeper meaning in life,Curious to dive deeper
436,Some of the earliest written poetry in Africa can be found among pyramids text written during the 25th century bc.,Curious to dive deeper
436," People search for truth through literature, like Wiman, an editor of Poetry magazine, who suffers from blood cancer.",Curious to dive deeper
436,Wow i did not know that. are you a cat lover?,Curious to dive deeper
436," I am not though I have a stray cat that is annoyingly cute that comes around and cuddles with me. Speaking of which, the cat in the Godfather opening scene was a stray that was found on set.",Surprised
436,I hole they at least feed him. Apparently there a cat named Stubbs as the major of Talkeetna Alaska since 1997.,Curious to dive deeper
436,That is interesting.,Surprised
436,To say the least! When a cat reaches 15 years old it has usually spent 10 years of it sleeping.,Curious to dive deeper
436," Ah, that is the life! I would love to go to a cat cafe where I could relax with cats and have a drink.",Happy
437,Hi. I think it's so fascinating to learn facts about the earth. Earth will be virtually helium free by the end of the 21st-century. I wonder what is causing that?,Curious to dive deeper
437,Good question! Humans only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds if the entire earths history was viewed as 1 day!,Surprised
437,Wow that is hard to believe. And back when the earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long.,Surprised
437,That is wild! Over 80% of Earths natural forests have been destroyed!,Surprised
437," That is quite sad. Only 20% remaining, well I hope we can conserve that at least.",Angry
437,Hopefully! Do you think extraterrestrials will ever make contact with us?,Curious to dive deeper
437,I don't know that is a good question I think at some point but I don't know if it will be in my lifetime. There is definitely a lot of sightings in the literature but no specific evidence. The FDA once burned 6 tons of literature in an active US censorship.,Curious to dive deeper
437,That is absurd! I love how there is a literature contest that challenges people to come up with the worst opening sentence to a novel.,Surprised
437,That is very funny I would love to read some of those sentences. One surprising thing is that romantic kissing is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even an ancient Greek literature.,Surprised
437,Very interesting. Love how Churchill won a nobel peace prize in literature and not peace.,Surprised
437,Yeah that is very interesting and something I did not know. He was a very smart man. Pretty cool he was  able to accomplish that back in 1953.,Surprised
437,Have you seen the Wonder Woman movie?,Curious to dive deeper
437,Yes I have it I thought it was really cool. Gal Gadot did a great job. DC comics must've been very impressed.,Happy
437,Definitely! She actually served in the Israeli Defense Forces for 2 years.,Surprised
437,Wow she is really an amazing woman. Explains why the fight scenes were so realistic. When wonder woman first appeared as a member of the Justice society in 1941 the group made her their secretary. Oh how times have changed.,Surprised
437,I did not know it was the highest grossing superhero origin movie!,Surprised
437,Yeah that is a huge accomplishment wow. It is also the highest grossing world war one movie.,Surprised
437,Very impressive. I really did like that movie.,Happy
437,Yes it was a great one. 2017 was also a great year for movies and it was the first year since 1958 that the top three highest grossing domestic films were female lead.,Surprised
437,Makes sense! Gal did not even know she was auditioning for wonder woman. She thought it was Catwoman!,Surprised
437,Ha ha that is hilarious.Patty Jenkins was a great director of that movie. Well it was nice chatting with you have a good day.,Neutral
438,What are your thought on Tina Turner? I think she is really talented,Curious to dive deeper
438," I remember her from childhood,  I definitely think she is super talented!  Such a unique voice.  Have you ever been to her concert? I hear Linkin park did 324 concerts in one year!  ",Curious to dive deeper
438," Thats a lot like 1 concert per day if you exclude holidays, seems like a big toll on the band",Curious to dive deeper
438," I know right!  crazy!  also the ramones played a total of 2,263 concerts! ",Curious to dive deeper
438," A total of 2,263 concerts! wow, that must have taken them years,",Surprised
438,Yeah its basically like they toured for over 20 years!,Curious to dive deeper
438," Oh that makes sense but still, 226 concerts per year is a lot, I wonder why they made it",Curious to dive deeper
438," Probably for the money lol that must be taxing on your body and mental health too,  thats like a non stop party for 20 years ugh. ",Curious to dive deeper
438," Yeah, sounds demanding, so do you like the Walt Disney Company?",Curious to dive deeper
438," Absolutely,  I love Disney.  Do you?",Curious to dive deeper
438," I love Disney as well, one of my favorite movies Big Hero 6, ",Curious to dive deeper
438," Nice!  I have so many,  little mermaid, aladdin,  lion king, inside out,  wreck it ralph,  incredibles, frozen, moana.",Curious to dive deeper
438," Those are awesome movies as well, interesting fact about Big Hero 6, the movie was made with a super computer, 55000 cores",Curious to dive deeper
438," wow!  Thats amazing.  I like the city it is based in, san fransokyo lol ",Curious to dive deeper
438," I like it too, a lot of creativity in the movie, another interesting fact is that minnie mouse is short for minerva mouse",Curious to dive deeper
438,I guess that makes sense!  Never thought it was short for anything lol,Curious to dive deeper
438," That was a new fact for me as well, do you remember Bill Nye the science guy?",Curious to dive deeper
438," Yes,  I do remember him,  they guy who looks like steve martin haha",Curious to dive deeper
438," Yeah the same one lol, well he was the science consultant in the movie Flubber",Curious to dive deeper
438,Thats awesome! The wall-e movie name is a tip of the hat to walt disney.,Curious to dive deeper
438," It is, I didnt like that movie much but the name is nice. ",Surprised
439,Have you ever seen the film Wonder Woman?,Curious to dive deeper
439,I havent. I do want to though.,Neutral
439," Yeah, it's an ok film, it's actually produced by DC Entertainment, I think I'm a fan of Marvel more though.",Neutral
439,I think I like Marvel better too.  My favorite of all time is Deadpool though.,Neutral
439," Oh, I love that character! But surprisingly even with how not good it was, Wonder Woman managed to be the highest grossing superhero movie!",Surprised
439," Wow, even higher than all the Batmans?",Neutral
439," Yes, and it's even considered a WWI movie, I wonder why though. Perhaps its because the actress, Gal Gadot, served two years as a soldier in the Israel Defense Forces?",Curious to dive deeper
439,That is cool that she served.  She seems to be a good role model for young girls.,Neutral
439," She really does. It's not a superhero thing, but Earth will be helium-free by the end of the 21st century, I wonder what kind of impact that would bring, do you know?",Curious to dive deeper
439," I am not sure, it is probably something I should know.  Humans have done a lot of damage to the planet.",Neutral
439," Yeah I agree, especially when the FDA burns through six tons of literature in an act of US censorhip",Surprised
439," That is so wasteful.  Did you know winston chruchills prize was in Literature, not peace?",Neutral
439,Oh really? Did he publish something to warrant the prize?,Curious to dive deeper
439,I think he did.  Dont know what though.,Neutral
439," There's an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with worst possible opening sentences to novels, I wonder why, any guesses?",Curious to dive deeper
439," I think there is a contest for that.  Man, that must be fun to judge.",Neutral
439,Yeah seriously and very entertaining too! Romantic kissing was only a fairly recent development! How is that possible!,Surprised
439,I dont know! I thought that was around for ages.,Neutral
439,Seriously! Maybe that's why the FDA burned six tons of literature! But why does the FDA have jurisdiction over censorship of literature?,Curious to dive deeper
439,Thats a good question. I am against all censorship.,Neutral
439," Me too, but maybe times have changed since then!",Neutral
440,Hey!  Do you enjoy Poetry?  It's a form of literature that uses aesthetic and the rhythmic attributes of language.,Curious to dive deeper
440," Hello there, yes I do enjoy some poetry for sure, how about yourself?  ",Curious to dive deeper
440,I do too!  I've even read some hunting poetry from Africa.,Neutral
440," That sounds very interesting.  Did you know Edgar Allan Poe only got $9 for his ""The Raven"" poem?  ",Curious to dive deeper
440,No that is amazing!  I remember reading that in High Shool.,Surprised
440,Yeah I will always remember that poem from a halloween episode of the Simpsons.,Curious to dive deeper
440," Some of the earliest written poetry comes from Africa, around the 25th century BCE. ",Neutral
440,I am really interested in reading some of that it sounds so cool.,Curious to dive deeper
440,Do you like astronomy?  I have always found Earth fascinating.  It was formed 4.5 billion years ago!  That's so old!,Surprised
440," Yeah I love learning and reading about it, so cool.  That is old!  Did you know years from now the earth will be helium-free? ",Curious to dive deeper
440," I did not know that.  I do find it sad however, that 80 percent of earth's forests have already been destroyed.",Sad
440," Yeah I think I read that somewhere as well.  It is very sad to me to think about that, and I'm sure it will continue to be destroyed. ",Curious to dive deeper
440," We think of a day as being 24 hours long.  But when Earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours!",Surprised
440,That is crazy to think how much longer the days are now.  Imagine going back to 5.5 days! You would feel like you lived a lifetime in a week lol.,Curious to dive deeper
440,If earth's  history was viewed in a 24 hour period.  Humans would only represent about 1 minute and 17 seconds.  Shows you how young we really are!,Surprised
440,Yeah that really makes you think!  Did you know that 71% of the earth's surface is covered by water?,Curious to dive deeper
440,Yea I have heard that.  And the remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands.,Neutral
440,Yeah its just crazy thinking how vast the oceans really are.  Did you know that we live on the densest planet in the solar system?,Curious to dive deeper
440,No I didnt.  I would have thought it would have been Jupiter or something.,Neutral
440," Yeah same here, I would never had guessed that it was earth, so interesting. ",Curious to dive deeper
440," Are you a Cat person?  Did you know when a cat is 15 years old, they have spent about 10 years of that sleeping?",Neutral
440," No, but I don't mind them.  That is astonishing, I guess they like to sleep a lot.  Well it was nice talking with you today, I hope you enjoy the rest of the day. ",Surprised
441,Are you afraid of snakes?,Curious to dive deeper
441,To be honest yes and I was born and raised in the country.,Curious to dive deeper
441," I am afraid of snakes too so no judging here, I think its a rational fear ",Fearful
441," Yes, I have a close friend raise snakes, he or she wouldn't never have to worry about me visiting, Hahaha.",Curious to dive deeper
441," Yeah I would stay as far as possible as well lol, a place to go if you hate snakes is New Zealand",Curious to dive deeper
441," Yes you are right, some snakes are poisonous and some are helpful, they eat other snakes and Insects.",Curious to dive deeper
441," There is a breed of flying snakes, that would be really scary like 5 times more scary than a regular snake",Curious to dive deeper
441," Yes you are right, I heard a friend of mine that worked with wildlife said that snakes are more afraid of human as well.",Surprised
441," Are they? maybe there just pretending lol, so enough of snakes, do you like music? concerts?",Curious to dive deeper
441," yes hahaha, I like concerts give me Bruce Springsteen, Elton John and Phil Collins, first three.",Curious to dive deeper
441," I went to a Linking Park concert once, it was a long time ago, and also to a Ramones concert, but other than that no",Curious to dive deeper
441," I used to live in Las Vegas, that where I saw Elton John, can you imagine linkin park doing 324 concerts in 2001.",Curious to dive deeper
441," I cant, thats a lot of concerts, thats almost a concert a day if you dont count holidays, ",Surprised
441," Where do these performance get their energy from, I am tired after doing one song when I am in church.",Surprised
441," Probably a lot of drugs, that can be really helpful or so Ive heard",Curious to dive deeper
441," Yes I agree with you, I am not familiar with the group ""The ramones"" is this an all male group or male and female?",Surprised
441," It was a male band, they all had Ramon as one of their names, not sure if they were family or if it was because of their artistic names",Curious to dive deeper
441,Wow that's embarrassment in 2002 a creed concert was so bad four concert doers filed a lawsuit against the band.,Curious to dive deeper
441," I used to like that band a lot, too bad the concert was so bad they got sued, the band used to have a lot of talent and a couple of great songs",Curious to dive deeper
441," They must have party all that night before the concert, many of these band members have problems like everyone else, sometime we all have bad days.",Neutral
441," I guess they all had a pretty bad day the night or evening of the concert, I still like their songs though. ",Curious to dive deeper
442,Do you like to read? Seems like Woman Who Fly is a great book,Curious to dive deeper
442," I like to read occasionally. I have not heard of that, what is it about?",Curious to dive deeper
442," Its about tales of flying woman, mythologies, visions of female freedom and emancipation, seems like a book with a really original plot",Curious to dive deeper
442,That sounds pretty cool and like something I would like. Did you know earth is almost 4x as dense as the sun?,Happy
442," No didnt know that, but I do know that it was formed over 4.5 billion years ago, crazy how we can tell with a carbon 14 test",Curious to dive deeper
442,That is crazy. There is a region in Canada with less gravity than the rest of the earth.,Happy
442," There is? I guess theres a lot more to earth than what meets the eye, im just glad 71% of earth is water, I love water, the sea, rivers",Curious to dive deeper
442," I love water regions too, especially the ocean. You could fit all the planets between the moon and the earth and still have room.",Happy
442," Amazing and it looks so close you raise your arm and try to touch it, days at earth when it first got formed were only 5.5 hours long",Curious to dive deeper
442,Thats pretty short. And I thought they were too short in the winter! Do you like to read?,Happy
442," I do like to read yeah, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
442,Yeah. Did you know romantic kissing is a recent development and it is not found in greek literature.,Happy
442," No, I do like romantic kissing in movies, books, they give the story unique touch, did you know about that annual literature contest of the worst opening sentence?",Curious to dive deeper
442," Yeah, I bet those would be pretty interesting to hear. There's a doctor that teaches heavy metal as a form of literature. ",Happy
442," Wow interesting, do you know who Winston Churchill is? well he won a novel prize because of literature.",Surprised
442," Yeah, he's very talented. The father of modern olympics won a gold medal in literature for writing a poem about sports. ",Happy
442," Thats interesting, literature, music, painting used to be events in the Olympic games. ",Curious to dive deeper
442,I can't imagine what olympic painting was like! I wonder why they stopped doing it.,Happy
442," That is hard too imagine I agree, maybe thats why they took them out of the games in 1952",Curious to dive deeper
442," Yeah, maybe. The latin word for literature is derived from the word letter.",Happy
442," So much about literature I dont know, interesting chat. ",Curious to dive deeper

443,Yeah i like that one too along with nutbush.,Curious to dive deeper
443," Did you ever read her first memoir ""I, Tina?""",Curious to dive deeper
443,I have not but i did see that movie it was riveting.,Curious to dive deeper
443,I haven't seen it nor read the book. I need to check them out.,Surprised
443,She's won three grammy's so far.,Curious to dive deeper
443,Do you feel like Ike was the worst thing that's happened to her?,Surprised
443,Worst thing meaning her relationship with Ike?,Curious to dive deeper

443," Snakes are elongated, legless creatures. do you know there is a lizard with no legs? Wouldn't that just be a snake?",Curious to dive deeper
443," It seems like it would be called that. Someone told me there's several in my area, but I've never seen one. ",Surprised
443,I would not want to. I hear there are snakes that appear to fly. Is that true?,Curious to dive deeper
443," That would be very, very scary. ",Surprised
443," I should probably move to new Zealand, they don't have any snakes there.",Curious to dive deeper

444," I know, a lot of people subscribe to the service, still Netflix has a huge deficit",Curious to dive deeper
444,I guess they have been spending tons of money. I know that Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth.,Neutral
444,I wonder why? isnt there whole business model online?,Curious to dive deeper
444," I guess some parts of the country have little bandwidth. People need DVDs and such. Still, many online users. From 9pm to 12am, Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in north america.",Neutral
444," So Netflix also has the DVD service, interesting, I guess every subscriber counts, still seems a bit excessive, 20 more times!!!! and wow 33% really?",Surprised
444,It seems to work. Netflix is now worth $2 billion.,Neutral
444," They have $21.9 billion in debt, not sure if its a giant anymore, theres also new streaming services out there that are a threat to Netflix",Curious to dive deeper
444," I expect them to have competitors. After racking up a $40 late fee on a vhs copy of Apollo 13, Reed Hastings was inspired to start netflix. Someone else will get inspired to take on Netflix.",Neutral
444," Blockbuster gave Reed the knife then, they did charge excessive fees.",Curious to dive deeper
444," Probably a big part of their business model. Then they thought they could beat Netflix at the online game. Now they're gone! Bye bye, BB",Neutral
444," I guess the lack of vision really affected the company in end, tech keeps on advancing and businesses have to adapt in order to survive, but anyways do you like the Star Wars franchise?",Curious to dive deeper
444," Yes, I do. It's interesting that James Earl Jones spent only 2.5 hours recording all of Darth Vader's lines and was paid $7,500",Neutral
444," Seems like someone got screwed over lol, only $7500 wow, his voice was terrifying",Curious to dive deeper
444," In 2013, Star Wars was dubbed in Navajo, making it the first major film to be dubbed in a Native American language. I wonder if James Earl Jones was involved with this.",Neutral
444," I dont think so at least not for the $7500 he got paid originally, do you have a favorite Star Wars movie?",Curious to dive deeper
444," The second one, Empire. That one is my favorite. Then the first one.",Neutral
444," Mine was the Return of the Jedi, do you also like Transformers?",Curious to dive deeper
444," I don't know them very well. Anyway, thanks for the chat! Have a good night!",Happy
445,Hi - do you like Netflix?,Curious to dive deeper
445,I do like Netflix but not as much as I use to. It doesn't seem like they have been adding new shows lately,Neutral
445,I used to like it better also. I only use it because we get it for free with T Mobile.,Curious to dive deeper
445,Are you a big fan of Star Wars?,Neutral
445,I'm not a huge fan. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
445,No not really. I tried to watch a couple of the movies but I couldn't get into them like some people do.,Neutral
445,Did you know Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth usage in North America from 9pm-12am?,Surprised
445,I didn't know that but it doesn't surprise me. I guess its pretty popular around the world.,Neutral
445,I guess so. Netflix and YouTube make up half the peak internet traffic in North America.,Surprised
445,I watch more youtube than I do Netflix. Which do you prefer?,Neutral
445,I prefer YouTube as well. Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth,Surprised
445,I think Neflix is over rated these days. It use to be pretty neat being able to stream movies. But then the cost went up and its not as awesome. Youtube is free and I can find lots more videos on random stuff.,Neutral
445,I agree. Netflix is worth $2 billion though so they must be doing something right.,Surprised
445,That is true. Do you like the movie Transformers?,Neutral
445," I have never seen it, but I like Megan Fox. She's easy on the eyes. What about you?",Curious to dive deeper
445,I never watched it seemed to be pretty popular back in the day,Neutral
445," I think it was popular. In the 2007 film, there are 1.53 explosions per minute.",Surprised
445,Well it was distributed by Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks. I think DreamWorks is the company that made Shrek.,Neutral
445,I think they are as well. I love DreamWorks films.,Happy
445,I think they are a very good company also. Their animation keeps me pretty entertained.,Neutral
445,It was good talking to you.,Happy
446,Hi. Do you watch Netflix?,Curious to dive deeper
446,I do all the time.,Curious to dive deeper
446,Me too! They have so many subscribers that they take up around a third of all bandwidth used at night!,Surprised
446," That's a lot, apparently they and youtube make up half of internet traffic during peek time in North America.",Curious to dive deeper
446,That's incredible. I only started using them a few years ago but I think they've been around since 1997.,Surprised
446,I've been a loyal customer since then and they have come a long way from the B-movie streaming they use to do.,Curious to dive deeper
446," Yeah, they have a bunch of original series now!",Happy
446,I know blockbuster has to be kicking themselves for not purchasing when they had the chance.,Curious to dive deeper
446,Definitely! They could have bought it for only $50 million.,Surprised
446,Right and to think they are worth 2 billion. I just watch the avenger infinity war on there. im a big marvel fan.,Surprised
446," I haven't seen a lot of the Marvel movies,was it good?",Curious to dive deeper
446,Awesome!! you know hasting got the idea after he had to pay a large late fee.,Curious to dive deeper
446,I heard it was a $40 fee or so. I feel his pain. I did that a time or two myself back then.,Neutral
446," Finally it got so bad i just had to find another store to rent from, haha! of the 137 million subscribers you mentioned, i believe that about 58 million are in the US.",Curious to dive deeper
446," That's cool that they have a large international presence. They have offices in Japan and Brazil, too. ",Surprised
446,Yeah that's right and i think their first series was called Lilyhammer. an oxymoron if i ever heard one.,Curious to dive deeper
446,True! I think that was made in 2012.,Neutral
446,Since then it's like they have a new show new movie every other week.,Curious to dive deeper
446," It certainly seems that way. Some of them are really good, though! It's been nice talking to you, Have a great weekend!",Happy
446," You too, thanks!",Curious to dive deeper
446,Goodbye!,Happy
447,did you know between 9pm -12 am netflix accounts for a third of the bandwidth in north america,Surprised
447,I can believe that. My son watches movies all the time along with TV shows and Netflick originals. He got me hooked on Stranger Things.,Neutral
447,a guy racked up $40 in late fees on a vhs so he started netflix,Neutral
447,I remember the days of rentals. What a pain that was. Now we sit at home and just stream everything. I still like to get Netflix dvds cause I don't understand how to stream. My son laughs at me.,Curious to dive deeper
447,well apparently netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth so maybe you aren't the only one!,Neutral
447," Yes, there's a lot of us old fogeys around. I liked them better before they changed their homepage. I find it very hard to find films anymore.Amazing that they are almost totally world-wide.",Curious to dive deeper
447,I agree. I hate the new set up. I didnt realalize netflix started its own content in 2012. I thought it was much more recent than that,Surprised
447," Well at first I'm sure everyone thought that their self production shows would be like Japanese sci-fi films, not worth watching. but some of their shows are very highly rated.",Curious to dive deeper
447,do you like star wars? james earl jones only spent 2.5 hours recording all of darth vaders lines and was paid $7500 i cant decide if that was a lot or a little in the 70s,Neutral
447,It was low for voice actors then but he certainly made the character more evil than anyone else could have. That series has made so many people rich. Especially George Lucas.,Curious to dive deeper
447,in 2018 the total value for the star wars franchise was $65 BILLION. Thats insane,Surprised
447," Yes and that launched the career of many people, the most notable being Han Solo. The acting in the first was atrocious but got better as more movies were made. All told a great movie.",Curious to dive deeper
447,I think its great that george lucas' wife marcia won an academy award for editing while george didn't win any for directing,Happy
447,He got his through notoriety. I think everyone knows his name. Some of the lingo has worked it's way into our language. Did you know that watching that movie was what made James Cameron go into directing?,Curious to dive deeper
447,I did not know that. In the original transformers movie there are 1.53 explosions per minute lol. Michael Bay must love to blow things up,Surprised
447," I think so! Special effects have become a huge part of action movies now, along with CGI of course. I guess the dept. of Defense has big ideas about transformers.",Curious to dive deeper
447,well those CGI effects took 38 hours to render one frame of movement,Surprised
447,I'm not a computer whiz but I have watched my son do his tricks as an IT expert and sometimes it takes him hours to resolve issues. I know that it would take me years to do one frame.,Curious to dive deeper
447,I think the same is true for monster inc it took like a huge amount of hours just to make sullys arm move. I dont think I'd have the patience,Neutral
447," I hear that Bey's latest production ""Bumblebee"" is getting great reviews.",Curious to dive deeper
447,I cna't believe there are still movies considering optimus prime has died 25 times in the last 30 years,Neutral
447,I haven't kept track but I'm going to remember that fact as a trivia question. I guess Bey actually appeared in one of the films by being a person who gets swatted away.,Curious to dive deeper
447,thats interesting,Neutral
448," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
448,I'm good thanks. I was reading about tennis recently. Didier Drogba  is a soccer player that stopped a civil war in his home country.,Curious to dive deeper
448,I read the other day that they have used helicopters to dry off the fields for tennis,Surprised
448,Wow. It's really amazing what they will do for professional sports. And yet grunting in tennis can be considered cheating.,Surprised
448,Really? I think they do that like every hit!,Surprised
448,The best players seem too. LOL!,Happy
448," Maybe it gives them an advantage! I know a black man won in 1968, and none have won since, that is odd",Curious to dive deeper
448,Was that Rodney Wallace's father?,Curious to dive deeper
448,I am not sure to be honest... I have also heard a tennis player invented the polo!,Curious to dive deeper
448,That makes me curious about who invented table tennis.  Apparently Ping Pong is the name of the company that sells table tennis equipment. It's not the name of the game. I was surprised when I heard that.,Curious to dive deeper
448,That is like the kleenex issue! Tennis is pretty much large scale ping pong!,Surprised
448," Totally! Kleenex and Reynolds Wrap are brands that are so well known, their genre of products are known by the company name.  Kind of like Association Football is known just as football, even if it's not a part of the Association.",Curious to dive deeper
448,Apparently we call that soccer because it was slang for Association football!,Surprised
448,Huh. I did not know that. I always wondered where the term soccer came from.,Surprised
448,there also is a version of soccer where 3 teams play at once!,Curious to dive deeper
448," Hmmm. If soccer players run an average of 7 miles per game, and they add a third team, I wonder, will that make them run closer to 10 miles?",Curious to dive deeper
448," most likely! that is a lot of running! a lot of people play though, over 250 million",Surprised
448," It's amazing. All those people who play, but there are still some who shine.  Rodney Wallace, for example, made 101 international appearances over 14 years.",Happy
448,he represented his country well! that is a lot of games!,Curious to dive deeper
448," I agree. He was born Costa Rican, but he has become an American.",Happy
448," that is a great thing for him, I am sure that was one of his dreams. hard work pays off!",Curious to dive deeper
449," Hi, how are you?",Happy
449," Hi I'm good, did you know that only one black man has ever won the us open tennis tournament?",Curious to dive deeper
449,Arthur Ash? I did not know that though. Thanks for sharing?,Curious to dive deeper
449," it might be, I'm not 100% sure, do you like tennis though? I do and I play actually",Curious to dive deeper
449,I like it and used to play. I do not play any more though. how often do you play?,Curious to dive deeper
449," I play in the summers we play a couple times a week, we play this game called pickleball a lot too its similar to tennis, did you hear that in 1969 they used helicopters to dry off the grass tennis courts, thats funny ",Surprised
449,I had no idea. I am in parks and recreation and pickleball is a huge sport for us. At least compared to some other sports.,Happy
449,ah nice have you ever played? its more action packed and easier than tennis I think,Curious to dive deeper
449,I have not but it does look fun. I am usually working when they are playing and would feel like too much of a slacker if I played instead of worked.,Happy
449," haha ya you have to work so thats fair, can you believe the longest tennis match ever lasted 11 hours spread over 3 days, I would be so tired",Surprised
449," I think that was john isner, no?",Curious to dive deeper
449," oh I'm not sure, I would hate to be the loser of that match though? It does seem like you know a lot about tennis players",Curious to dive deeper
449," I watch way too much sports. If it is a big moment in sports, I know about it. I wish I watched less tv though but I love sports so much.",Happy
449," ya I agree, do you know the origin of the polo shirt? like who invented it and such?",Curious to dive deeper
449,I do not. Was it Ralph Lauren?,Curious to dive deeper
449," well it was created by a tennis player named Rene lacoste actually, and his nickname was the crocodile",Happy
449," I think I did know that, or at least now that you explain it to me it make sense. Lacoste is popluar attire for tennis.",Surprised
449," ya you're right, do you know any soccer facts? thats one sport I never watch haha",Curious to dive deeper
449,European soccer is on before college football and the nfl so I watch it on saturday and sunday mornings. I also watch the MLS. I do not know a ton of trivia though. Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
449," well I do know the city that will host the 2022 world cup doesn't exist yet, they have to build the whole city",Surprised
449,Qatar. Im going to quit while I am ahead. Nice chatting with you!,Happy
450,Hi there do you like association football?,Curious to dive deeper
450,Hi there I actually do. Do you know why it is called soccer in the US?,Curious to dive deeper
450,Yeah it is actually just a slang that stuck around,Curious to dive deeper
450,Yeah pretty interesting. Jon Steward used to be a soccer player too,Curious to dive deeper
450,Yeah he represented the US in the panamerican games in Brazil back in the day,Curious to dive deeper
450," Yeah pretty cool. It is a good sport to be in, they make more money than many other sports combined. ",Curious to dive deeper
450,Yeah it seems that way. Did you hear that German player donated his earnings from the World Cup?,Curious to dive deeper
450," Yeah he helped 23 little children in Brazil, what a human being",Curious to dive deeper
450,Yeah very heartwarming. Did you know there is a variation of soccer with 3 teams,Curious to dive deeper
450,Wow that would be interesting to watch. Do they need three goals then?,Curious to dive deeper
450,I am curious too. Do you know where the World Cup will take place in 2022?,Curious to dive deeper
450,I know that it is going to be in Qatar but I do not think they have the city ready for it yet,Curious to dive deeper
450,Yeah that is strange indeed. The US men's team got third place once in 1930,Curious to dive deeper
450,Yeah but after that it was all down. But the women's team is doing pretty well,Curious to dive deeper
450,Yes they have never placed below 3rd. so good for them,Curious to dive deeper
450,Yeah they sure are good. THere are no economic gains though for the host countries,Curious to dive deeper
450," And yet they bid to have it there, Hmm does not make much sense. Do you like tennis ?",Curious to dive deeper
450," I do , as much as I like polo shirts and we have tennis to thank for that",Curious to dive deeper
450," Yes that is true, Rene Lacoste to be more exact. Glad the other adopted the style too",Curious to dive deeper
450,Yes very true. Do you know how long was the longest match?,Curious to dive deeper
450,yes it lasted 11 hours and they had to stretch it over 3 days,Happy
451,Hey! Did you watch FIFA World cup the last summer?,Neutral
451,Hey yeah I caught some of it. I love it because it is an international competition!,Neutral
451,I'm wondering about 2022 in Qatar. They even didn't build city for the final. It's small country actually.,Surprised
451,Yeah they better get going. They promised air conditioned arenas that would reduce temps by 30 degrees celsius!,Curious to dive deeper
451," But I guess the decision to make it not in the summer 2022, but in low season like February or November. However, there is conflict with major championships. Anyway it would be fun. Do you watch tennis?",Neutral
451,Yeah I definitely enjoy watching tennis. Back in 1978 they could use anything for a racket-that would make it more interesting!,Surprised
451,Do you know that the longest match in history was 11 hours or about 3 days to play? It's incredible!!!,Surprised
451,Wow they must have been exhausted. Whereas the longest point was a 643 point rally lasting 29 minutes!,Surprised
451," I guess if in 2019 they make video how a helicopter is used to dry the glass tennis courts, it is going to be viral everywhere! haha",Happy
451,Oh that is so cool I wanna look that up! Ping pong is like tennis but it isn't the sports name. The sport is actually called table tennis.,Surprised
451,do you play table tennis?,Curious to dive deeper
451,Yes I do it's a fun sport. you? I think it's funny how some people consider grunting before a tennis shot to be cheating.,Surprised
451," True. I used to play a lot in my school years, but just don't remember when I played the last time. I didn't kniw that Lacoste was invented for tennis players. I was always sure for polo players, but they just adopted it.",Surprised
451," Yeah same. I never knew the tennis ball was covered with felt, I thought it was a different type of material.",Surprised
451," I've read something about it. Anyway despite all, soccer makes much more money that football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey combined. I'm not surprised. ",Neutral
451,Yeah it is such a global sport! On average soccer players run 7 miles per game. No wonder they are in such great shape.,Surprised
451," Yes, it's quite average for 90 min game. I honestly say football, not soccer, because I more interested in this sport and all people in the world call it football. It was slang in US and this is why we call it this way.",Curious to dive deeper
451,Interesting. Yea I always wondered that. Oddly enough Greenland can't join Fifa because not enough grass grows there.,Surprised
451,haha. It's nice. They are part of Denmark actually. Do they have enough men for 1 team? haha,Happy
451,Good question! What's even crazier is the superbowl is smaller than soccers (or football for you) 3rd biggest event.,Surprised
451," Yes, I can believe in it. It was nice to chat with you. Have a great day!",Neutral
451,You too! Have fun watching the next world cup in qatar!,Neutral
452,Did you watch the Pacific Rim Uprising movie?,Curious to dive deeper
452," Hello there, no I have not see it, is it any good?",Curious to dive deeper
452," I did, I thought it was pretty good, the first movie was better though, had more action",Curious to dive deeper
452,I will have to check it out sometime then if I get a chance.   Are you a big user of Netflix?,Curious to dive deeper
452," I am a big user, I have an account and use it almost every day, mostly after 9pm, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
452,No I don't have an account currently.  So you are one of those that make up using all that bandwidth during peak hours lol.,Curious to dive deeper
452," I am a part of that group, yes, lol, its also YouTubes fault as they together with netflix they take upon half of the internet traffic",Happy
452," Yeah I can totally see that, YouTube is so popular among younger people it's crazy to me. ",Curious to dive deeper
452," It is really popular, just like Netflix is, its amazing how the service has 137 million subscribers around the globe",Curious to dive deeper
452," And that number is still growing, thats so many.  But, it is quality stuff, you get access to an insane amount of content. ",Curious to dive deeper
452," I agree, you get more than what you pay for, I used to spend a lot of money on rentals and those late fees were a real pain to pay",Curious to dive deeper
452," Yeah I think that is why Hastings started the company in the first place, he was in your same shoes. ",Curious to dive deeper
452," Could be, so he must hate Star Wars then, do you like the franchise?",Curious to dive deeper
452," Yeah I grew up watching the movies years ago when I was a kid, I still think the ones from the late 70's/early 80's are the best ones.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
452," I do too, I think old movies are the best ones, I love Star Wars personally, I dont like the new movies as much though, ",Curious to dive deeper
452," Yeah I'm the same way when it comes to that.  It is hard to replicate, and I know the Star Wars fans are so hardcore and hard to please as well!",Curious to dive deeper
452," Yeah I agree with you, its amazing how much the franchise is worth though, 65 billion dollars!!",Surprised
452,Yeah that is an insane amount.  I wonder how much it was worth back in the 1990's?,Curious to dive deeper
452," I bet not much, at least at the beggining 20th Century Fox didnt have much faith in the movie, that lack of faith cost them millions",Curious to dive deeper
452," Yeah they dropped the ball, Disney sure spent a bunch but i'm sure it will all pay off in the long run. ",Curious to dive deeper
452," They need to improve the movies, have more jedis in them, do you like Transformers?",Curious to dive deeper
452," Yeah I agree with that for sure.  No, I have only seen about 5 mins of one of the films.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
452," I like the series, I thought the first movie back in 2007 was the best one though and didt like the The Last Knigh premiered in 2017",Happy
452,I will have to check that one out sometime then.  Well it was nice talking with you today.,Neutral
453,Have you ever seen Keeping up with the Kardashians?,Happy
453," Yes, I know bits and pieces. I know Kim was born 10-21-80. ",Happy
453," Yeah, it's basically just her and her family doing everyday life things. Did you know she named her baby Chicago?",Happy
453,I did know. It is a nod to Kanye's hometown and the city is special to K & K  so the name is perfect because baby Chicago was hard to conceive so she is extra special as well.,Happy
453,That's a pretty sweet meaning. Did you know Kim used to be Paris Hilton's personal assistant?,Happy
453,I did know. That is how she first gained media attention but after her 2003 sex tape was leaked in 2007 she really became popular.,Curious to dive deeper
453,That,Neutral
453,I know one of my kids used to play the Kim Kardashian app on their phone. I think it came out in 2014.,Curious to dive deeper
453," Sorry about that, I accidentally pressed enter. I haven't used the app, but I have heard of it. She was also in a fall out boy music video. I wonder which song?",Happy
453,I did not know she was in a music video. I know after the 2007 sex tape leak she and her family began appearing on E! reality TV show Keeping up With the Kardashians.,Curious to dive deeper
453," Yeah, that's a really lucky break for releasing a sex tape. I'm pretty sure her mom released it on purpose. ",Happy
453,Maybe. I know Kim is on the 2015 Time Magazine's list of 100 most influential people.,Surprised
453,She definitely has a lot of influence. She recently met with trump to discuss prison reform.,Happy
453," I did not know that, but good for her. I know she also has a book about how she is a trailblazer of the selfie movement.",Happy
453," Yeah, she's definitely a busy and hardworking person. Speaking of celebrities, did you know Judge Judy makes $123,000 an episode?",Happy
453," Holy cow! That is a lot of money! I wonder where she rates on Hollywood's likability ""q score""? I know Tom Hanks rates a 48, while Kim's is a -71, which is hilarious.",Happy
453," I've never heard of a q-score, but it sounds really interesting. I think most of the Kardashians are probably not good in relations to likability. ",Happy
453,I would have to agree. I know critics and admirers have described her as exemplifying the notion of being famous for being famous.,Happy
453," Yeah, she doesn't have a lot of actual talents. Just being wealthy and now famous. They are always coming up with new ways to stay in the spotlight.",Happy
453," Yes, I agree. Although she is reported to be the highest-paid reality personality of 2015 with her total earnings exceeding $53 million.",Angry
453," Yeah, I guess I would do some silly stuff like that if I was making that much money off of it. It was nice chatting with you!",Happy
454,Have you seen the movie Solaris?,Neutral
454,No.  Do you know anything more about it?,Curious to dive deeper
454," I just think the theme is fascinating ... the tension arising from floating around a planet, but never landing.  Have you felt that way in life?",Curious to dive deeper
454,No.  I did learn lately that our planet is also called Gaia.,Neutral
454," Oh, I mean, where you're constantly in flux and you see everyone else with concrete life happening and making progress ... and you're not.",Surprised
454,I read about a planet that orbits 4 stars.  Perhaps that would parallel the concept you are discussing.  The direction would be hard to determine.,Neutral
454," Interesting.  I've heard of dual-stars, but this is four?  Normally planets just have the one star, so that would be extraordinary.",Surprised
454,Clearly the universe is amazing.  Early humans could study it some since 5 planets are visible to the naked eye.,Neutral
454," I don't think I could tell the difference between them.  But just imagine having the time and attention to discern that there are five different ones, all without photography!",Surprised
454," No doubt!  Previous generations were intelligent too.  As long ago as 1975, the Soviets sent a spacecraft to Venus and mankind saw pictures of the surface.",Neutral
454," I'd say they were smarter.  I think the current generation only feels smart because we've got all this technology and knowledge at our fingertips.  So then, we feel like we can fill all our time with comedy.",Sad
454,Great point.  They created wealth that allows free time in our lifetime.  Evan Almighty was a comedy that had a budget of $200 million.,Neutral
454,And what else could be done with $200 million?  Probably something much more important.,Disgusted
454," I think that it is neat that it can be done.  The $200 million did not disappear.  Cameramen, actors and many others received income from it. It is not as respected as some other genres.  It has been 37 years since a comedy won Best Picture.",Neutral
454," True.  What film was that?  For as popular as comedies are, you'd think it would not have been so long.",Curious to dive deeper
454," I don't know the film.  However, The Empire Strikes back was nominated for best comedy in 1981 by the Writers Guild.  That is strange.",Neutral
454," Calling something a comedy when it's not really makes you think about it ... have we all been viewing it wrongly?  Such organizations sometimes get it wrong, like when 3rd Rock from the Sun won for best comedy series over Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier in 1997.",Surprised
454,What do you call 3rd Rock?  Satire is comedy also.,Neutral
454," I'd call it comedy, satirical for sure, but just not better than Seinfeld.",Neutral
454,Oh!  I agree with you on that.  Awards have a political factor in decision making.  I saw that Drew Carey did stand up in the Marines for 8 years before he started making money from comedy.,Neutral
454,Sometimes it takes while to get it right and then cash in.  I'm glad some networks like Comedy Central take risks and then cancel shows if they flop.  They've cancelled over 100 shows in the past three decades.,Happy
454,Wow. That is a lot of shows to cancel.  We have so many channels now that most shows that are good can find an audience.,Neutral
454," And enough people willing to explore them all until they find them.  If you asked me to watch tv from another country to find something I like, it would take me weeks.  Americans seem to just put in that effort on a regular basis.",Neutral
454,Well.  I think I will go now.  Enjoyed the talk!,Neutral
455,What's up? Are you into pop music? It originated during the mid-1950s,Curious to dive deeper
455,yes very much so.,Happy
455,Until the 1960s rock and pop were considered the same,Neutral
455,right ! and do you know that korea has its own k-pop band which is the most popular musical group in the country,Curious to dive deeper
455," Yea, Moranbong band I believe ",Neutral
455,yes thats right. and another cool fact is that the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office ?,Happy
455," Lol that's nuts. I didn't know Ricky Gervais was a pop singer in the 80s, it's hard to imagine",Surprised
455,i know ! i never would have thought that either!,Surprised
455," Apparently scientist voted ""We are the Champions"" as the catchiest pop song, I wonder how they came up with that",Neutral
455," im not sure , but they are probably right.",Surprised
455,I guess they concluded that pop has grown louder and increasingly musically homogeneous since the mid-1960s,Neutral
455,yes and in  2002 CREED ocncert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band! wow !,Surprised
455," I don't blame them, I don't much like Creed myself.",Happy
455," yes they are !, it was great talking to you about music, i loved it , thank you ",Happy
455," No problem. Did you know the Ramones played 2,263 concerts? That's wild",Surprised
455,yes thats pretty wild!,Happy
455,Apparently they toured non-stop for 20 years,Neutral
455,cool! and did you know that when eddie van halen recorded the guitar solo for Beat it  that he literally set the speakers on fire,Surprised
455," Lol, no but that's awesome. Pink Floyd recorded a live concert with no audience",Neutral
455,wonder if they were just practicing ?,Surprised
455," I don't think so, they did it in the ancient roman amphitheater in pompeii.",Neutral
455," thats really interesting , thank you for the conversation. good bye",Surprised
455,See ya,Neutral
455,good bye,Happy
455,peace,Neutral
456,Hello how are you today?,Curious to dive deeper
456," Hello, I am good. How are you?  Do you listen to jazz music?",Neutral
456,I like all music. Did you know jazz originated in the African American communities of New Orleans in the late 19th and early 20 century.,Curious to dive deeper
456,i think I did know that.  Seems like I've seen a movie that referenced it.  Didn't they combine jazz with some brass band marches or something?,Neutral
456,It has roots in blues and ragtime.  It is now recognized as a major form of musical expression.,Neutral
456,I'm glad.  It's world wide now too.  Pakistan has a jazz orchestra!,Neutral
456,Cool jazz actually originated in the 1940s. It introduced calmer smoother sounds and long linear melodic lines you hear in todays jazz.,Neutral
456,i like that. There's a lot of good music from the 40s.,Neutral
456,Were you aware that Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast.,Neutral
456,No I wasn't.  i guess going by the characters he plays in movies I just never made the connection.,Neutral
456,Oh he is a big fan. He even scored several films including million dollar baby. That is a great movie.,Happy
456,He did?  What instrument does he play?,Neutral
456,I think he played a few different instruments. There is a woman in Harlem who has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every Sunday or over 20 years.,Neutral
456,That's cool. I bet she's pretty good to last that long.,Neutral
456,She occasionally has top performers stop by. I wonder if Clint has ever checked it out.,Neutral
456,You never know.  He's a top performer if he can do a movie score.,Neutral
456,I just figured it would be something that would interest him. Did you know jazz trumpeters grow out their goatees because it provides comfort while playing their instrument.,Neutral
456,No lol! I just assumed it was for fashion.,Neutral
456,So what do you think about Judge Judy making 123000 dollars per episode. I heard she retired not to long ago.,Happy
456," That surprises me. I mean, i'm shocked she made so much money and that she retired.",Neutral
456,She was the highest paid celebrity behind Lebron James. I cant believe she made that much.,Surprised
456," I can't either.  I knew her show was popular but not that popular!  Well, I've got to go for now.  It's been nice chatting with you!  Have a great day!",Neutral
457,Hey did you know that Queen's guitarist has a PHD in astrophysics? thats crazy,Surprised
457," Wow.  That's cool.  Much cooler than,  say, playing the accordion... ",Curious to dive deeper
457," Do you play any instruments? I gave up videogames and started playing the piano a couple years ago, and I haven't looked back since haha",Curious to dive deeper
457," No, unless you count an mp3 player.  I do love music except of stuff like accordions.  I definitely wouldn't pay $25 a ticket for that kind of music.",Curious to dive deeper
457," No, and it's shocking that a creed concert was so bad that people filed a lawsuit against them, on the other hand I don't really like creed so I'm not that surprised haha",Curious to dive deeper
457," Wow, they must have been really buzzed.  I don't know if Creed is considered pop but I mostly like alternative and stuff off the beaten path.  You?",Curious to dive deeper
457," I really like classic rock and 80's, I can listen to almost anything except country, I do like pink floyd a lot and that's awesome they did a live concert to no audience haha",Surprised
457,I do like 80s stuff like REM and the B52s... I even go back further once in a while and listed to Pink Floyd as recorded on a floating recording studio.,Curious to dive deeper
457," ha I would love to do that, I do like Queen, I didn't know their guitarist uses coins as guitar picks, did you see the new movie that came out about Queen?",Curious to dive deeper
457," Loved Freddie and his band... I haven't seen the movie yet but want to... Did ya know that scientists declared ""We Are the Champions"" the catchiest pop song of all time.  Scientists?",Curious to dive deeper
457," haha like how do you measure that? It is catchy but I would think it would be another song, ti's scary that lincoln park has done 324 concerts in 2001, that's almost 1 per day that sounds exhausting",Surprised
457,Yep.  That's crazy.  They must like doing it cause that has to take its toll.  I guess performers like that go all the way back to ancient Greece and Rome.  We still use their acoustic designs for venues/amphitheaters.,Angry
457," Yes that is probably why Pink Floyd played the live concert in that Roman amphitheater, even though there was no one their the acoustics must have been amazing, it's shocking they didn't record a video at least",Curious to dive deeper
457,No kidding... I would like to see that.  Pink Floyd is very creative but on the dark side.  While I'm not big on pop at least it's mostly upbeat albeit mind numbing...,Angry
457," ya it is, pop music is good in small quantities for me, I like more complex stuff but pop music is good to pass the time and for parties",Curious to dive deeper
457," Yeah… I prefer guitars and amped up stuff to most R&B, rap and hip-hop.",Happy
457," I can't believe that the Ramones played a total of 2,263 concerts so far that is a massive number.",Surprised
457," Yeah, makes ya wanna get sedated huh?  That's cool... Can't believe Eddie Van Halen set speakers on fire... Something tells me there's more to it that his playing like maybe he had it turned up to ""11""",Curious to dive deeper
457," Ya see that is awesome, I can't believe teh president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums, I want to see trump release an album just to hear what that would sound like haha",Curious to dive deeper
457,Something tells me that Trump singing may be accompanied by an accordian.,Surprised
457," haha ya I wonder what instrument he would play, did you know that Ricky Gervais was a pop singer in the 80's?",Surprised
457," No, don't even know who he is? I thought it was weird that the CIA sponsored a music event (Coupe Mondiale).",Curious to dive deeper
457,That is wild.,Surprised
458," Hello,  do you know much about cinematography?",Curious to dive deeper
458," Not really, I'm an avid movie watcher. I have heard of Roger Deakins who constantly is getting nominated for awards.",Neutral
458," Oh ok,  I havent heard of him. Thats great though,  hes been nomiated  times. ",Curious to dive deeper
458,Do you like visiting D.C.?  They have over 250 restaurants and a Summer Restaurant Week.,Curious to dive deeper
458,I have never been there. I did read that recently.  Did you know no woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography?,Curious to dive deeper
458,That will probably change soon.  I didn't know Stanley Kubrick was involved with Spartacus.,Surprised
458,Me either.  do you like comedy?,Curious to dive deeper
458,Yes.  I can't believe the Green Lantern was going to be a comedy with Jack Black!,Surprised
458,Yeah thats weird!  Not sure it woldve made it better though lol,Curious to dive deeper
458," Couldn't have hurt much. :) I was surprised to know that the Python programming language was, in part, named after Monty Python. ",Surprised
458," Yeah thought that might have been a coincidence.  I guess comedy central has not been doing great,  It has cancelled over  shows!",Curious to dive deeper
458," That or they're picky.  Bill Murray isn't so picky.  He thought the ""Kung Fu Hustle"" was super great. ",Neutral
458,It was a great movie!,Curious to dive deeper
458,I am an amatuer astonomer and Jupiter's moon Ganymede fascinates me since it is big enough to be a planet.,Curious to dive deeper
458,That is really big!,Curious to dive deeper
458,Another one is that Uranus is actually rotating on its side.  Many think it was involved in a major collision.,Curious to dive deeper
458," Oh thats interesting.  and the accident threw it off axis?  If it rotates on its side,  does that mean there is an area that doesnt get any sun?",Curious to dive deeper
458," Yeah, the sunlight is in weird time patterns on the poles. I guess the building blocks of life (e.g., RNA) have been detected on a planetary system 455 light-years away. ",Curious to dive deeper
458,Do you know what planet it is where shards of glass rain sideways in 2000 degress fahrenheit?,Curious to dive deeper
458,I would guess one of the outer ice planets - probably Neptune.  Venus doesn't have seasons or that kind of wind.,Curious to dive deeper
458," interesting,  thanks.  ",Curious to dive deeper
458,Thank you.  You were a great chat partner.,Neutral
459," Hey, how's it going? Are you a fan of Phil Collins at all?",Curious to dive deeper
459," Yea Phil Collins is a pretty good singer, I never knew he was in the beatles movie ""A Hard Day's Night""",Surprised
459," Yeah I liked Genesis in particular, back when he was paired up with Peter Gabriel. Though they've both had solid solo careers.",Neutral
459," Yea, it's crazy Collins sold 100 million in Genesis and as a solo act",Surprised
459,Do you have a favorite song from Phil Collins or Genesis?,Curious to dive deeper
459," I really like the 1984 hit ""Against All Odds""",Neutral
459,I'm a big fan of Invisible Touch. That was after Peter Gabriel left and it more just Phil Collins leading the way. Right before he went solo.,Happy
459," Yea, ""In the Air Tonight is also a great song, it's cool that Collins 17 year son gets to play concerts with his dad",Neutral
459,Are you more a fan of pop or rock music?,Curious to dive deeper
459,Probably Rock music but they were basically the same thing until the late 1960s,Neutral
459,Did you know Rick Gervais was a pop singer in the 80's? I can't picture it lol,Surprised
459," No, that's pretty funny. In Japan they have 100 % cgi pop stars",Neutral
459,Pop music is huge in Asia. Especially k-pop. I think there's a boy band from Korea even going around in the US now,Curious to dive deeper
459,I wonder if their songs use the same 4 chords as most pop hits in the US,Curious to dive deeper
459,I bet it does. Do you remember that band Creed? Man they were awful.,Curious to dive deeper
459," Yea they were, they sounded much worse than the 4 chords always used in pop songs",Neutral
459,Apparently once they were so bad that four of the people that attended a concert sued them for being bad.,Surprised
459,Lol that's pretty funny. Did you know Deep Purple broke the record for the loudest concert?,Curious to dive deeper
459," Nope, that's pretty cool! Loved that song Smoke on the Water.",Surprised
459,Yea it's a great song. It's weird Abba turned down 1 billion dollars to do a reunion tour,Surprised
459,That is weird. It was nice chatting with you!,Neutral
460,Are you a fan of pop music?,Curious to dive deeper
460,i do like pop music. You?,Neutral
460," I love it, it became popular in the states around the 60s right?",Curious to dive deeper
460,i guess? i dont know what the definition of pop music is. i figure there must have been stuff in the 50s too.,Neutral
460,Do you have a favorite pop artist?,Curious to dive deeper
460," i dont, but recently i was listening to xtc. they did an album called oranges and lemons.",Neutral
460,He did? one of my favorites is Rikey Gerwais he used to be a big deal back in the 80s,Curious to dive deeper
460,i did not know that he did pop music. i thought he was a comedian.,Neutral
460," He was a pop singer in the 80s really talented in fact, pop music has grown a lot louder since the 60s",Curious to dive deeper
460,it sure has. the amplification systems have improved substantially.,Neutral
460," It has, my favorite pop song is We Are the Champions and its actually voted as the catchiest song by a group of scientists",Curious to dive deeper
460," yeah, have you seen the movie about queen? that song shows up. it sure is catchy.",Neutral
460," I did watch that movie, thought it was really cool, liked it  alot",Curious to dive deeper
460,it was a fun film. Rami won an oscar for his performance. i wish i had seen queen in concert.,Neutral
460," I think Remi diserved it, he nailed the role and I wish that too, have you been to any great concerts lately?",Curious to dive deeper
460,no i have not. no money for it. i used to go quite frequently when i was younger.,Neutral
460,Did you ever go to a Ramones concert?,Curious to dive deeper
460,i wish i had. those guys were always touring. i missed my chance.,Neutral
460," I missed mine too and also the chance to watch Linkin Park live, they performed 324 concerts in 2001 alone",Sad
460," those kids were great! that is an insane effort on their part. i wish i had seen them. too. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
460," Really hard, 1 concert per day, the toll it must have taken on them and I agree its been a great chat, thanks a lot. ",Curious to dive deeper
461,I am not a super Phil Collins fan-are you?,Neutral
461," Hello there, I am not but he does have a few good songs. ",Curious to dive deeper
461,He has done a lot of stuff. I am more of a Mick Jagger person. I think the era of mega stars like that is over. Too bad.,Neutral
461," Yeah Mick was awesome, the Stones had so many great hits over the years.  I can't believe they still tour!  That is impressive!",Curious to dive deeper
461,He is my age and I can't even get out of bed in the morning. He's a marvel.,Neutral
461," Lol, yeah and their shows are like 2 hrs i'm pretty sure, that is so nuts.  Do you attend many concerts these days?",Curious to dive deeper
461,Not now-too expensive. The first time I saw Led Zeppelin was at a place called The Boston Tea Party. They had just come to America and no one knew who they were. It was a small Club so I got to see them up close.,Happy
461," That is awesome, they were one of the best ever, very jealous of you.  ",Curious to dive deeper
461,I saw a lot of people there. Andy Warhol was a sponsor. I think I liked BB King the best. But I don't remember Phil Collins.,Happy
461," Wow, that sounds like an amazing time.  BB King would be awesome to see as well.  I have only been to smaller bands, I did see Radiohead play though, that was pretty cool, but to be honest I mainly went to see the opening band!",Curious to dive deeper
461,It was easy to see everyone in the Sixties. Tickets were cheap and a lot of people played on the Boston Common. Judy Colling and Joan Baez used to sit on the sidewalk in front of the Harvard Coop and play for free.,Happy
461," Wow, that is so awesome, most of the music I listen to comes from the 60's, I would have done anything to see Marc Bolan or Syd Barrett perform live. ",Curious to dive deeper
461,I like Pink Floyd! I don't see that We are the Champions is the catchiest tune ever. That makes no sense.,Happy
461,Good call! Yeah I don't agree with that at all.  There are plenty more catchy tunes from the 50's and 60's I would say.,Curious to dive deeper
461,I would have liked to see Pink Floyd in a Roman Amphitheater. I bet the sound was really good.,Happy
461," Yeah that would have been cool, so many concerts over the years that would have been amazing to attend. ",Curious to dive deeper
461,I used to like the music really loud but I saw Led Zeppelin (after they got to be famous) at the Boston Garden and it was too loud. Ever one lit little candles-you couldn't do that now. The Fire Marshall would have a heart attack. lol,Happy
461," Yeah imagine them trying to do things like that now, no way!  So, be glad you got to experience it like that I would say. ",Curious to dive deeper
461,Everyone was friendly and there was no trouble. Can you imagine?,Happy
461," Yeah exactly, now days there are always people to ruin everything, and it can't just be fun and simple anymore. ",Curious to dive deeper
461,You are right. Sad but true. Nice talking to you.,Fearful
461," Yeah same here, hope you have a good day. ",Happy
462,Hi There! Do you like movies?,Curious to dive deeper
462," I like movies, it is a form of art. . ",Neutral
462," This is interesting..Even though spartacus had a cinematographer, stanley kubrick took the camera away from him and did it himself. ",Happy
462," You have to do it yourself, he was very talented, I saw some of his films, but never Spartacus, is it good ? ",Curious to dive deeper
462," It is! But this is interesting too..even though he did almost none of the work, when spartacus got the academy award for best cinematography, it went to the credited cinematographer, and not kubrick.",Curious to dive deeper
462," Probably, some kind of union thing, like he was not an official cinematographer.  I wonder if they gave him something for it. ",Curious to dive deeper
462,Thats a good question! No woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography.,Disgusted
462,I guess it is because there is not many female cinematographer because they would not hire them. Sexism still exist.,Sad
462,That is terrible. A woman has never even been nominated.,Disgusted
462," Yeah, do you see movies made by a woman ?",Curious to dive deeper
462," I haven't paid attention to that. I'll have to now. Cinematographer roger deakins has been nominated 13 times for the best cinematography oscar, and has never won.",Surprised
462," He was good but not enough, did he do any comedies ? I like those kind of film. ",Curious to dive deeper
462," I don't think he did. Do you like Bill murray? Bill murray thinks kung fu hustle is ""the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy"".",Happy
462," I like Bill Murray, Chinese comedies can be really funny. But I never saw kung fu hustle. Did you ?",Curious to dive deeper
462," no, not my type of movie! I do like Jack black though. The green lantern film was originally going to be a comedy starring jack black",Happy
462," That would have changed the tone of the movie, he is very slapstick. ",Neutral
462," Some of his stuff is good, Some bad. Did you watch 3rd rock from the sun? ",Neutral
462," I did when I was young, it was good but not memorable, not like Seinfeld. ",Neutral
462," 3rd rock from the sun won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997, beating seinfeld, friends, and frasier.",Happy
462," That is surprising and not surprising at the same time, we don't know what will stand the test of time, disco was not forever. ",Neutral
462,True! Wow! Comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows since its creation in 1989,Happy
462,You have to try new thing and not be afraid to admit your mistakes. Comedy central would have been bankrupt if they continued to produce those 100 unfunny shows.,Neutral
462," True, I learned this the other day..The creator of the python programming language named it partly to honor british comedy group monty python",Happy
462," Do you like Monty Python ? I like absurd comedy, so I like them.",Curious to dive deeper
462," Not really, I never really understood it.",Neutral
462,Don't worry I don't think I would find funny an ancient greek comedy. Everyone has his own tastes.,Neutral
462,Very true. Do you know anything about plantes?,Neutral
462,I don't know I know we live on Earth. have a good day.,Neutral
462,you too!,Happy
463,Do you enjoy music?,Neutral
463,Yes. I love Jazz music but I also have a love for Kanye West songs.,Neutral
463," Jazz is amazing. I love how it maintained its core essence, yet amalgamated with local musical culture to generate countless distinct styles",Neutral
463," Yes. I listen to it every night when I eat dinner. I have really gotten into Modal jazz. Most people like Jazz-rock, but I'm more of a 1950's guy.",Neutral
463," I think all you mentioned are great, but personally I enjoy how cool jazz has developed",Neutral
463,Are there any particular cool jazz groups you like?,Neutral
463," Not in particular, but I do enjoy the calmer smoother sounds and linear melodic lines. Looking at jazz overall, my favorite probably would be frank sinatra",Neutral
463,Kanye West often compares himself as the modern day Frank Sinatra.,Neutral
463," I will admit both made their mark on music, but I like Sinatra more",Neutral
463," Do you see yourself jealous of Kanye's success? I sometimes do. He has Kim Kardashian, hot and a money maker.",Curious to dive deeper
463," Well I won't deny I would desire money and success, however, their lives of living under the microscope and being stalked by paparazzi sounds too stressful",Neutral
463,Even if you get all the tea's in the world? I guess it's bad for their children who have to be subjected to the awful names and filmed. I can't believe they named their child Chicago.,Surprised
463,I don't think that is too bad. I know a family whose last name is trout so the father named his sons red and brown,Neutral
463," Were their English limited or do they have some psychological problems...? Do they not understand the damage they can cause the children? These odd baby names, although originated from somewhere is really bad for the kids.",Disgusted
463," They said that it was terrible when young, but very helpful when they became adults since everyone remembered them positively. I think it's better than hashtag",Neutral
463,I guess so. The kid can build character based on these names/nick names.,Neutral
463,There are also a lot of people trying to name their children after celebrities or characters in films like rocky,Neutral
463," I wish i had Celebrity income. Judge judy makes $123,000 per episode.",Neutral
463,True. I mean Kim Kardashian had earnings of 53 million to date,Neutral
463," I would also get special access, did you know pixar studio has a secret room visited often by celebrities?",Neutral
463," That's cool I wonder what is inside. In any case, thank you for the amazing chat.",Neutral
464,I just read a section on comedy which states that the python program was partly named after Monty Python. I love how they did that!,Happy
464,Yeah the programming language I think is what you mean. Classic comedy. Kung Fu Hustle is a brilliant comedy also.,Happy
464," I've actually never seen it, whats it about? ",Curious to dive deeper
464,It's a wacky cartoony slapstick comedy. Bill Murray loves the movie too.,Happy
464," i'll add it to my list of movies to watch. Bill Murray is such a great comedian, unfortunately I don't think he's been in movies as of late. Green lantern is on my list of movies to watch too, weird to think that it was initially going to be a comedy",Surprised
464,Yeah I think Jack Black was supposed to star. Hard to believe that 3rd Rock beat Seinfeld for best comedy in '97 at the golden globes,Surprised
464," I've actually never even seen an episode of 3rd rock. Seinfeld was revolutionary, are you more of a Seinfeld or Friends fan?",Happy
464,Seinfeld by far. Friends doesn't hold up very well for me. I wonder if it would have been one of the 100 shows Comedy Central cancelled over the years if it had been on that channel. You? Friends or Seinfeld?,Curious to dive deeper
464,perhaps! I'm actually more of a Friends fan myself lol. It's interesting how much tv shows and movies have changed over the years. Even just through more advanced filming abilities and styles. Shout out to James Wong for pioneering the use of wide-angle lenses amongst other things,Happy
464,He was quite the pioneer despite the racism.,Sad
464," he had a lot to overcome and still won an Oscar. I've read in other articles that the Oscars are pretty racist too, not recognizing talented individuals due to their race. ",Curious to dive deeper
464," There are definitely some problems. A woman has never won best cinematographer, or even been nominated.",Sad
464,that's some crazy stuff. It even must be frustrating with Roger Daekins for being nominated 13 times and never having won,Surprised
464,And the guy who was supposed to be the cinematographer for Spartacus didn't actually do the work and won the academy award.,Surprised
464,I'd be pretty angry if that happened to me lol. Have you heard of Gavin Free before reading about him?,Neutral
464,Yeah he did slo-mo cinematography on Hot Fuzz.,Curious to dive deeper
464," interesting, Hot Fuzz was a good movie. I thoroughly enjoy comedies",Happy
464,Yeah it was. Comedy is a great art form. It all started back in ancient Athens.,Neutral
464," Its interesting how the change of definition of ""planet"" meant that Pluto was no longer a planet. ",Happy
464,I'm still bitter about that. I never want to visit the one that rains shards of glass at 4500mph.,Curious to dive deeper
464,thats such an unusual characteristic of a planet. Sounds like complete chaos there lol AND it's 2000 degrees farenheit. insane.,Happy
464,Maybe we'll make it to Ganymede someday. It's a Jupiter moon big enough to be a planet.  Cya!,Neutral
464,thanks for the conversation!,Happy
464,Sure!,Neutral
464,bye!,Happy
465,Do you happen to enjoy pop music?,Curious to dive deeper
465," I do, I like Queen myself. Did you know that it's been scientifically proven that ""We Are The Champions"" is the catchiest pop song of all time?",Curious to dive deeper
465,I did not but I love Queen. Are you familiar with K-pop?,Curious to dive deeper
465,I'm kind of familiar with it.,Curious to dive deeper
465,Me too. There are several songs that stick in my head It's catchy. There is a K-pop band called Moranbong Band that is the most popular music group in the country. I am not familiar with their music.,Curious to dive deeper
465," I've never heard of them before. I heard that rejection letters from Sub Pop Records to aspiring artists start with ""Dear loser."" That's kind of disheartening.",Surprised
465,Wow! I new they were an edgy company but that's harsh. Did you know that Ricky Gervais was a pop singer in the 80's? I cannot picture that.,Curious to dive deeper
465,I've heard that and I can't believe it. I'm glad he stuck with comedy instead of that.,Curious to dive deeper
465,Me too. Do you like to attend concerts?,Curious to dive deeper
465," I do, I'm actually attending one next weekend. I wish I could have been at the Foo Fighters concert that was so loud it showed up on New Zealand's seismic monitors!",Curious to dive deeper
465,I didn't know that happened. I do love the Foo Fighters though. Did you know that in 2001 Linkin Park played 324 concerts because their album was so successful?,Curious to dive deeper
465," Oh wow, that's alot of concerts. That album is one of my favorites. Have you heard about Deep Purple breaking the record for the loudest concert in 1972? Three audience members were rendered unconscious!",Surprised
465," I did not. That seems excessive to me. I'm surprised Deep Purple would be the ones to play a concert that loud. Did you know that The Ramones played 2,263 concerts over the span of their career?",Curious to dive deeper
465,That's a lot of concerts! Wow. Did you know that Abba turned down $1 BILLION to do a 100 concert reunion tour?,Surprised
465,I did not. Wow! They must still have a lot of money saved to be able to turn that down. I don't like to laugh at the misfortune of others but I find it amusing that concert attendees filed a lawsuit against Creed because their concert was so bad.,Happy
465,That is pretty funny. It must have been towards then end of Creed.,Curious to dive deeper
465,I would assume so. I also recently learned that Pink Floyd held a concert in 1972 with no audience. I wonder why they did that?,Curious to dive deeper
465," Oh wow, that's kind of odd. I heard that in 2010 Lou Reed and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs. I'm sure they enjoyed it. ",Surprised
465,Lou Reed is a weird guy so I'm not that surprised. There is an ancient Roman amphitheater in Croatia that is used as a concert venue. I bet that would be amazing.,Happy
465,That would be an amazing experience seeing a band playing there.,Curious to dive deeper
465,It would leave you with a story to tell for sure. I would take so many pictures.,Happy
466," Hello,  do you know much about celebrities?",Curious to dive deeper
466,Yes I do. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
466,No I dont know much lol there are too many celebrities.,Curious to dive deeper
466," Yep, I know about the Kardashian family and Kanye. They are always up to something. ",Happy
466,Did you know that Pixar studios has a secret room for only celebrities?,Curious to dive deeper
466,No I did not know that until I read these articles. The favors celebrities get bothers me.,Disgusted
466," Yeah seriously,  kinda ridiculous.  Also,  how much they get paid,  I feel like actors and actresses dont even do the hardest work,  all the editing and music and stuff seems like way more work lol",Curious to dive deeper
466," I agree, Kim Kardashian earned $53 million in 2015, Judge Judy earns $123,000 per tv episode!! just mind blowing. There are people out there going to bed without food. ",Fearful
466,I really dislike that whole Kardashian family. I think  it is ridiculous how much money they make and they dont really seem to earn it.  I think I saw one episode where the younger one wants to buy a house and doesn't even know what credit is.,Curious to dive deeper
466," lol, they are socialites and the media has elevated them. Just revealing their 3 rd child's name - Chicago blew up social media. ",Curious to dive deeper
466," Yeah it's crazy,  and all their businesses are completely run by other people. They act like they are so stressed all the time. ",Curious to dive deeper
466,How about a Harlem woman who has held a Jazz concert in her apartment every Sunday for 20 years!!! crazy,Surprised
466,Thats pretty awesome.  Im sure the clean up is pretty bad to have to clean your apartment every sunday lol,Curious to dive deeper
466,Yep! and top performers occassionally stop by.,Happy
466," That  nice,  do you like jazz?  who is your favorite artist?",Curious to dive deeper
466,I really don't care for it. Tony Bennett impresses me.,Curious to dive deeper
466,Jazz trumpeters grew goatees because it provides comfort.,Curious to dive deeper
466,lol. What do you think of people who use surrogate mothers?,Surprised
466," I think its a great idea,  it creates options for people who cant or dont want to carry a baby. what do you think of it?",Curious to dive deeper
466,I agree. It is humanity at its best.,Happy
466,Been good chatting.,Neutral
467,Hello do you like pop music?,Happy
467," I do like pop music, I also like accordions though, did you hear about the big accordion Festival that is happening in Virginia?",Curious to dive deeper
467,I didn't.  Could you tell me more about it?,Curious to dive deeper
467," Yes it takes place in Falls Church, Virginia and there are going to be about a hundred and fifty people celebrating with accordions there",Happy
467,That would be interesting to see.  Did it have anything to do with the 80th anniversary of the American Accordionists Association?,Happy
467," Yes I think so. And that one of the people among them is Lou Coppola, he's been doing this and playing the accordion for about 28 years now",Happy
467,Where is he from?,Curious to dive deeper
467," He's originally from Bridgeport, Connecticut, speaking of music though what kind of pop music do you like",Curious to dive deeper
467,I like all kinds.  I grew up in the 80's so that pop music era is my favorite.  I was surprised to find out that the actor Ricky Gervais was a pop singer in the 80s/,Happy
467," Yeah that is shocking! It's also shocking that scientists determined the queen song, We Are the Champions, to be the catchiest song of all time LOL",Surprised
467,lol That is funny.  I remember hearing that song so much at sports games while I was growing up.  The president of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office. I wonder if they were any good? lol,Happy
467," Wonder if one of those is the catchiest song of all time LOL I would guess not, did you know that North Korea has a K-pop girl band? And it is the most popular group in the country?",Surprised
467,LOL You're probably right! hahaha  Do you like going to concerts?,Curious to dive deeper
467," Yes I do like concerts. One of my favorite concerts I wish I could have gone to was Pink Floyd, what about you",Curious to dive deeper
467,I love going to concerts.  Used to go to tons of them back in the day when they were more affordable and played in areas that were easy for me to go to.  Pink Floyd recorded a live concert at an ancient Roman amphitheater in Pompeii with no audience. lol Wonder why they did that?,Happy
467,Yeah I hope they recorded that it's probably an amazing concert haha. What do you think about Creed though? They were sued because their concerts were so bad back in 2002,Curious to dive deeper
467," That must have been a really really bad show! lol  The Ramones played a lot of shows over a 20 year span...a total of 2,263 shows!",Happy
467," It is a lot of shows!  I do think that Lincoln Park is more impressive though, they did 324 concerts in only one year",Surprised
467," Wow.  That is alot.  In Croatia, there is an ancient Roman amphitheatre that is still used for concerts.  That would be cool to see a show in a setting like that.  ",Happy
467," I agree with you! I want to see some guitar playing in that Amphitheatre haha, Have you ever learn to play the guitar",Curious to dive deeper
467,I used to play but wan't good.  lol  Brian May from Queen uses coins as guitar picks!  That's unique.,Happy
467,That is really cool. Also cool is that Van Halen actually set a speaker on fire when he was playing a guitar solo LOL that's so metal,Surprised
468,Do you tend to follow elections in the country?,Curious to dive deeper
468," Yes I plan to, it heard to decide who to vote for, I almost gave up on voting at one point.",Curious to dive deeper
468,I know how that feels; sometimes it seems like there's no good option. I can see why voter turnout has been under 70% in the past hundred years.,Sad
468," Yes that's true, are you plan to vote in next election?",Curious to dive deeper
468," I try to vote every time. I missed the first election when I was eligible, but the last presidential election was very interesting, so I try to research and vote every time now.",Neutral
468,Not being personal but do you that your entire voting was negative and no positive with the president?,Curious to dive deeper
468,I definitely felt like I was voting against someone more than I was voting for someone. Was that how you felt too?,Curious to dive deeper
468," Well, I felt a little like that, My main concern is that I knew this country is going down hill with killing, drugs, rich, poor, I just wanted a change.",Curious to dive deeper
468," That's how I felt too. I think the influence of the media was a major factor. According to actual rates, it's safer than it ever was in the past, but we're able to hear about so much more.",Sad
468," Yes, you are right and nothing to very little is been done about it. We really need a strong and respectful leader.",Curious to dive deeper
468," Most of all we need a leader that can unify us. Elections seem so polarized lately that it will be hard to find one, though. Nobody wins if they campaign as a compromiser.",Neutral
468," That's true, but it doesn't matter what kind of president we get, he or she will not satisfy everyone, so that's why I always say do what best for our country, this is just my opinion. ",Curious to dive deeper
468," I agree with you completely, and I appreciate the way you say it in a respectful and nonpartisan manner. The best for the country is something that everyone should strive for.",Neutral
468," That's true such as jobs, health Insurance and so many other things.  I thinks a leader like that will be hard to find.",Curious to dive deeper
468," The difficult part is that everyone has their own idea of what's best for the country, and sometimes the politicians they agree with don't fulfill their promises.",Neutral
468," You are right, since I was voting, Presidents speak of good things that people want to hear and after 8 years nothing change and this was going on for years.",Curious to dive deeper
468," I think it would help to get some new faces in politics and reform some of the systems that may have worked decades ago, but aren't as functional in modern times.",Neutral
468," Did you know since 1900, the tallest candidate has won us presidential election 75% of the time? ",Curious to dive deeper
468," In that case, maybe the next candidates should invest in some stilts.",Neutral
468," Hahaha, you are right, voters turnout for president election hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years.",Surprised
468,Hopefully elections will take a turn to inspire people to vote more. It was good talking to you and finding a like mind about things!,Neutral
469,Have you ever heard of the civil rights lawyer Michael Trister?,Curious to dive deeper
469," No, was he black?",Curious to dive deeper
469," That is my understanding, I believe he was forced from professorship in the late sixties, probably because he was black.",Sad
469," oh ok, how about john macain, he was a jeopardy contestant in 1965 ",Curious to dive deeper
469," He was, I wonder how he did?  With the length of that show, and it's weekly showing there must be lots of now famous people that have been on it.",Surprised
469," probably, he also made a cameo in the movie wedding crashers",Surprised
469," Interesting that if you are born around the Panama canal you can be American, do we lease or own the land for the canal.  I know we pretty much built it.",Surprised
469," not sure, mccains mom is still alive and took race car driving classes in her late 90's!",Surprised
469," They sound like an adventurous family, he must have got his courage from his mom.",Happy
469," yeah! speaking of politics, voter turnout for presidential elections has not breached 62% in the last 100 years",Surprised
469," That's kind of sad, people can't complain if they don't vote,  In some countries, Australia for instance, you get fined for not voting.",Sad
469," interesting, neveda is the only state that has ""none of these candidates"" voting option for pres elections",Surprised
469,Do they keep a tally of how many times people check that.  I wonder what they'd do if that got the most checks.,Surprised
469," i wonder, and what if all the states had that option?",Curious to dive deeper
469," The lawyers would have a field day, remember all that fuss in 2000 with the hanging chads.  If every State had none of the above win it would be chaos.",Curious to dive deeper
469," definitely, funny fact, the taller presidential candidate has one 75% of the time since 1900",Surprised
469," I'm six four, maybe I missed my calling, I could have been president.  My height comes in useful at concerts, people are always complaining about me when I stand in front of them.",Happy
469," funny, and who would think of keeping that data",Surprised
469," There's always someone keeping track of data, just ask Facebook.  Maybe one day out elections will be done over Facebook, it sounds like it has a higher participation rate than Presidential elections.",Curious to dive deeper
469," ha true, nice chatting",Happy
469," Have a good evening.  Have a good day.  Have a good morning.  Or as they do in Nevada, none of the above.  Bye",Neutral
470,Hey!,Happy
470," Hello there, how are you doing? Do you attend many concerts these days?",Curious to dive deeper
470," I am great! I haven't been to a concert in awhile, but have been to a lot in my life! How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
470," Yeah I am the same way, I haven't been for a few years but used to go all the time.  What would you say is your favorite ever?",Curious to dive deeper
470," I would have to say Pink Floyd, or Linkin Park, there is so many! ",Happy
470," That is awesome, I am a big Pink Floyd fan, well I kinda am, of their first album.  But any concert that they ever played would be really cool to attend. ",Curious to dive deeper
470," Yes, they have the best shows that I have seen. Aerosmith puts on a great concert too.",Happy
470," That sounds good as well.  I really like the Apples in Stereo, they put on a good show.  Radiohead was really good as well, although I really went to see the opening band, thats sad but true. ",Curious to dive deeper
470," I love Radihead, who was the opening band at that concert?",Curious to dive deeper
470," Yeah they are awesome, and I wasn't aware of how little they toured!  But I really wanted to see Steve Malkmus and the Jicks. ",Curious to dive deeper
470," Oh wow, I haven't heard of them. I hope you enjoyed that concert though! ",Happy
470," Yeah it was really good, I was in high school, I remember my friend and I went together, it was awesome. Alpine Valley in Wisconsin. ",Curious to dive deeper
470,Cool! I have enjoyed every concert I have ever been to. I heard that there was a lawsuit against the band Creed for the show being so bad lol....I wonder how that worked out.,Neutral
470," Yeah that is so lame to me.  If you don't like it, then you learn your lesson and don't buy any more tickets to any more concerts. ",Curious to dive deeper
470," Exactly! So do you ever go vote in the elections at all? Pretty sad John Mccain passed away but he went through a lot, so many people died in 2018. ",Curious to dive deeper
470," Yeah there were a lot of good people who died this past year.  And yeah I do, did you know the voter turnout for US presidential elections hasn't gone over 62% in the last 100 years!?",Curious to dive deeper
470,Really? That's it? more people need to get in to these elections because every vote counts!,Neutral
470," Yeah isn't that crazy, that seems way to low to even be true but it is. ",Curious to dive deeper
470," Kind of sad really. I also heard that Michael Trister, civil rights lawyer died, a few people that did a lot of good have been passing lately. ",Neutral
470," Yeah that is sad as well.  Here is a really weird fact, did you know that just under the last 120 years, the taller presidential candidate has won 75% of the time?  Better start making that bet in vegas!",Curious to dive deeper
470," Really? Haha, that's odd! I have a funny fact...John McCains mom....took race car driving classes and she is in her 90s! ",Surprised
470," That is super funny! I wonder what the fastest she ever drove was, legally or illegally? ",Curious to dive deeper
470,I don't know how fast she went but being in her 90s she must have wanted to drive a race car really bad lol...no time like the present!     It has been great chatting!,Surprised
470," Yeah right, and yeah same here, I hope you have a good night. ",Happy
471,did you know that john mccain was once on jeopardy 1965,Curious to dive deeper
471,No I didn't know about that. Have you ever heard of Michael Trister by the way? He was a civil rights lawyer and died recently,Curious to dive deeper
471," yes, pancreatic cancer. he did a lot of work with desegregation. ",Curious to dive deeper
471," Yes he sounds like a great guy, also he lived until he was 77, which is a good life I think",Happy
471,i loved that he was a lawyer for planned parenthood and unions too.,Happy
471," He also helped a lot of people, for instance he created guidelines about lobbying and what each other's about election Law and Order to do the best job for advocating for the different causes",Happy
471,yep. and he did so much worked with Mississippi Center for Justice. they do so much work opposing racial and economic injustices.,Curious to dive deeper
471," Back to John McCain no, did you know that he voted against a Federal holiday for Martin Luther King",Surprised
471,I did. he had some problematic votes and opinions while he was serving as a senator.  i think he is also one of the few senators to cameo in a movie.,Surprised
471," Yes you're right he made a cameo in that movie""Wedding Crashers"" I always thought that movie was pretty funny",Surprised
471," i wonder how many people voted the ""none of these candidates"" option when he ran on the nevada ticket. ",Curious to dive deeper
471,Yeah I wondered about that too. I probably would not use it myself because I would just vote for someone that I liked. Did you know with John McCain that you was actually born in the Panama Canal Zone,Surprised
471,was his father in the military as well?,Curious to dive deeper
471," Yes I think he was. He also had a media reputation for being called a""Maverick""",Surprised
471,i recall that was a big part of the 2008 elections where obama prevailed.,Neutral
471,Yep I think you're right. He was actually a former military officer and served as a US senator from 1987 until he died in 2018,Surprised
471,in the current turmoil it stung to lose an unlikely semi ally. in ancient athens there werent elections cause they thought it would lead to oligarchy. they did it by a lottery system. imagine that,Curious to dive deeper
471," Yeah I don't know about using a lottery system that sounds very dumb to me, but it is interesting that 75% of the time the taller candidate will win the presidential election",Surprised
471,thats an observation for sure. i wonder how that would change with voter reform and fairer votes in the electoral college.,Curious to dive deeper
471," Yes I'm not sure, but it is an interesting statistic, what are your thoughts on the fact that in 2012 us International election observers were banned from viewing the polls in 9 US states",Fearful
471,I think it is weird.,Neutral
471," Yes I wonder why that happened, it also makes me sad that our elections max out at 63% turnout that seems low",Surprised
472,Are you a big google user?,Curious to dive deeper
472," Yes, regularly use Google to do searches. You?",Curious to dive deeper
472,I use that and bing so I can earn some amazon gift cards.,Happy
472,How does the gift card thing work?,Curious to dive deeper
472,Look up bing rewards.  You earn points for doing searches but they have a limit on the amount you can earn each day.  Did you know that google was created over 20 years ago already in 1998?,Happy
472,Yes. Wish I'd invested in Google stock when they made 2004 public offering!,Curious to dive deeper
472,Oh yeah!  A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send men to the moon!,Happy
472," Right. Mind-boggling, but shows advancements in tech. svcs. and products, doesn't it?",Neutral
472,Yes!  Google maps calculates traffic by tracking how fast android devices are moving on the road.  That's pretty mind boggling too.  So they are pretty much tracking cell phones and using some of the data for that.  Interesting.,Happy
472," Well said. Did you know that if you wanted, say, to find a location in the disputed region of Kashmir, Google would show you only the map of the claims of the country (India or Pakistan) where the browser you're using is located?",Curious to dive deeper
472,I didn't know that before but now I do!  Thanks!  Do you remember when Google went down for about 5 minutes on Aug. 16th 2013 and took 40 percent of the web traffic with it?  I don't remember it.,Happy
472," Me, either, but I do know that internet companies like Google, or Amazon, use tech that is often beyond my comprehension...Do you suppose that's the point, really?",Curious to dive deeper
472,It might be.  I'm a big Amazon customer.  Are you?,Curious to dive deeper
472," In the past few years, have ordered books and supplies from Amazon, yes. They have - almost anything, don't they?",Curious to dive deeper
472,Yes.  I have Prime and we got rid of the cable because the video streaming service for Prime is worth the price of Prime every year.,Happy
472," Heard that streaming is great, and that Amazon is producing original fillms and TV shows. My fav. is The Grand Tour.",Curious to dive deeper
472,My kids like the Grand Tour.  Amazon now will even deliver your packages on Sundays because they have a contract with the US post office for the delivery service.,Happy
472," Convenient, too. If we lived in China, the giant e-commerce co. would be Alibaba. Did you know its founder was turned down by Harvard & Yale as an under-grad. student? Think they're sorry, now?",Curious to dive deeper
472," I didn't know that!  I bet they are.  Jeff Bezos has made so much money off of Amazon that he built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years!",Happy
472," Far out - in time, that is. Brilliant guy, though. Has vision. Even named a building on Amazon's Seattle campus after his 1st Amazon customer! Why not?",Curious to dive deeper
472,That is neat!  IMDB is also owned by Amazon since 1998.,Happy
472," Yes. Whether it's Amazon (big, powerful warriors) or Alibaba (magical) the AI these giants employ is beyond me. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
472,AI scares me.  lol  I don't trust it.  It's been a good chat.,Happy
472," Enjoyed your comments, thanks. Cheers!",Happy
472,Have a good day!  Thanks as well!,Happy
473,Do you like the piano?,Curious to dive deeper
473,I love the piano!  I am not able to play well though.,Neutral
473,I took lesson but dropped out. Its been around since 1700,Curious to dive deeper
473,There are pianos everywhere.  There was even one on the Hindenburg.,Neutral
473," Wow, thats nuts.  Did you know there are aluminum pianos?",Curious to dive deeper
473,I heard they weigh 356 pounds.  Seems like a lot but pretty light for a piano.,Neutral
473,Yes for airships.,Surprised
473," I wonder if those are also at the top of mountains, like the one in Britain?",Curious to dive deeper
473,I heard about that in 2006 when climbers found it,Curious to dive deeper
473,I wonder how it got there.  I mean it is not like they are small...,Neutral
473,Had to be helicoptered up I am sure.,Curious to dive deeper
473," Definitely not carrying that up in my pack, even if my girlfriend insists on taking it with us.",Neutral
473,Amazing sound though from strings being struck by hammers.,Curious to dive deeper
473," Yeah, tons of intricate parts.  Did you hear that Freddie Mercury and Paul McCartney both recorded some of their famous music on the same piano?",Neutral
473," Yes, hey jude was performed and recorded with that piano",Curious to dive deeper
473," Such talented musicians, the both of them.  I would have loved to see Freddie in concert!",Neutral
473,Yes nothing like live music in front of an audience.,Curious to dive deeper
473," Not like the one concert Pink Floyd recorded Live, no audience!",Neutral
473," Wow, at the amphitheater I hear.  ",Curious to dive deeper
473,In Pompeii at that!  How cool!,Neutral
473," Yes, that is right!  Great chat, have a good night.",Curious to dive deeper
473,You too!,Neutral
474," Hi, do you use Amazon?",Curious to dive deeper
474," Hi, are you interested in Google, Amazon, or Artificial Intelligence?",Curious to dive deeper
474,All three of those actually. They are two of the biggest innovators we have and one of the most interesting scientific fields.,Happy
474," Yes, I agree. I really enjoy AI although all three of these topics are probably so interrelated that we don't realize it. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is sometimes called machine intelligence (which is actually demonstrated by the machines) in contrast to human intelligence.",Curious to dive deeper
474,Yes it is amazing what we can hopefully apply AI to in the future. It can really help out with some difficult tasks.,Curious to dive deeper
474,I took Computer Science in college and it is defined as the study of 'intelligent agents' or any device that perceives the environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.,Curious to dive deeper
474," I only took a basic Computer Science course, we never delved into Artificial Intelligence. I don't know too much about it besides some basic reading.",Curious to dive deeper
474," I learned some stuff in Master's level courses and colloquially, the term 'artificial intelligence' is applied when a machine mimics 'cognitive functions' that humans associate with other human minds such as 'learning' and 'problem solving'.",Curious to dive deeper
474,What do you think the biggest priority should be in the application of Artificial Intelligence?,Curious to dive deeper
474," Actually, the scope of AI is disputed as machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered as requiring 'intelligence' are often removed from the definition, a phenomenon known as the AI effect, leading to the quip in Teslar's Theorem, 'AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.'",Curious to dive deeper
474," I know some people are afraid of AI and think machines will become too self aware. I don't think we will ever run into that problem, science fiction has made people too paranoid.",Neutral
474,I totally agree with that since machines are run on computer programs that humans wrote.  Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems such as chess and Go.,Curious to dive deeper
474," I know I have lost my fair share of chess games to a computer, I even saw a computer compete at very high levels at Jeopardy. It only slipped up when questions were worded somewhat ambiguously.",Neutral
474," Yes, computers could NEVER actually think like humans can although they can autonomously operate cars, provide intelligent routing in content delivery networks and military simulations.",Curious to dive deeper
474,Yes they can really help us out when the task is something that lends itself to automation but not when there are moral or ethical complications.,Neutral
474,Very true. Did you know that Stanford's free AI class uses Google plus Hangouts to help them teach more effectively?,Curious to dive deeper
474," I did not know that, I have used Google Hangouts for interviews and meetings. We even used it once for a fantasy football draft that a lot of people couldn't attend in person.",Curious to dive deeper
474,Awesome use of it. Did you know that there is a non-profit organization for the advancement of Artificial Intelligence?,Curious to dive deeper
474," That's great, it's an area that we should definitely fund as there are a lot of great applications of the technology. Just the medical field alone could immensely benefit from it.",Curious to dive deeper
474," I agree, even Facebook is developing an AI designed to understand user emotions, identify objects in photos, and predict user actions.",Curious to dive deeper
474,Facebook may be the one company I don't trust with AI after all their recent data scandals. It was very interesting to chat AI with you and I definitely learned a few new things.,Happy
474,Nice chatting with you as well.,Curious to dive deeper
475,Its crazy how Google and Amazon have grown,Curious to dive deeper
475,It's hard to even believe Google has been around for over twenty years.,Neutral
475," I know right, seems like its been around forever",Curious to dive deeper
475," And Amazon has been around even longer, since 1994.",Neutral
475," Its a long time, Amazon started as an online bookstore right?",Curious to dive deeper
475," Yes, but now it's largest Internet retailer in the world!",Neutral
475," It is, it sells everything from books to groceries to pet supplies you name it, I love the company",Curious to dive deeper
475,It also sells low-end and affordable products under its own brand called AmazonBasics.,Neutral
475,Have you tried the Amazon Basics products?,Curious to dive deeper
475," Sure. I used Amazon for practically everything, but I also used Google. I guess I'm not alone because when Google went down for about five minutes in 2013, 40% of the web traffic went down with it.",Neutral
475," I love Google as well, you know it was founded by two PHD students in Standford University",Curious to dive deeper
475," Yeah, and together they own 14 percent of the company, and control about 56% of the stockholder voting power.",Neutral
475," I thought they owned a bigger percentage of the company, I heard the company wants to reoganize some of its interests in a company called Alphabet Inc",Curious to dive deeper
475," Yes, they actually announced that several years ago. Most recently, Larry Page was removed as the CEO of Google and is now the CEO of Alphabet.",Neutral
475," A guess that makes sense, Google is a big company and it must have more than one CEO for different divisions, have you ever used the Maps app?",Curious to dive deeper
475," Yeah, it's interesting how they determine the borders of countries with disputed borders.",Neutral
475," I agree, interesting and they also calculate traffic using android devices that are in movement on the road, thats just genius and bit invasive",Curious to dive deeper
475," Definitely, though everything is invasive these days, so what are you going to do? Did you know it takes more computing power for a Google search than it did for Neil Armstrong to go to the moon? That's insane!",Neutral
475," Yeah if you have nothing to hide then theres nothing to worry about right? and no I didnt know that, thats an amazing fact",Curious to dive deeper
475," They care a little about the environment, I imagine, too. Once, they hired hundreds of goats to mow the laws at Googeplex instead of people.",Neutral
475,Thats an efficient way to get things done lol,Happy
475," Yeah, they're located in California, unsurprisingly since its founders went to school there.",Neutral
476," Hello there, do you use Amazon much?",Curious to dive deeper
476,Hey yeah I love Amazon use it all the time! Hard to believe amazon workers walk between 7 and 15 miles each day.,Neutral
476," Yeah I use it quite a bit myself, and it is hard to believe, I would think no more than 2 or 3. ",Curious to dive deeper
476,Yea that seems more accurate. Also I was interested to know IMDB is owned by Amazon.,Surprised
476," Yeah I didn't know that about them, I wonder how many other things they own?",Curious to dive deeper
476,Yeah good question. I respect Bezos though. He built the largest internet retailer in the world all the way back in 1994.,Surprised
476," Yeah Bezos is a great businessman.  Did you know he built a clock into a mountain that will run for 10,000 years?",Curious to dive deeper
476," Whoa I would like to see that. The Amazon contract with USPS must explain how they are able to deliver packages so fast, even on Sundays!",Surprised
476,Yeah I wonder how the postal employees felt when they learned that Sundays are no longer off days for all.,Curious to dive deeper
476,Yeah I bet that didn't go over so well. But only a matter of time until Artificial Intelligence will start delivering for Amazon. There is even a non profit organization for the advancement of AI.,Curious to dive deeper
476," I think I read that, I wonder who funds that kind of organization?",Curious to dive deeper
476," Yeah good question I'm not sure. AI is definitely good at solving puzzles though as it crushed all human records in the puzzle game ""2048"". ",Surprised
476," That is pretty impressive, did you know the actress Kristen Stewart once co-authored a paper on AI?",Curious to dive deeper
476,I didn't take that actress for the scientific type. I would like to attend one of Stanford's free AI classes.,Curious to dive deeper
476," Yeah same here, I think that would be very interesting to sit in on a class or two. ",Curious to dive deeper
476,Very much so! I just hope machines don't become so capable that they start to perform things without commands!,Fearful
476," Yeah and that is where it starts to get scary, especially if we give them a lot of control. ",Curious to dive deeper
476,Yeah. There has to be a fine line between helping us out but not taking over. I would think that google would make a good AI. Google once used hundreds of goats to trim it's lawns instead of making people do it.,Surprised
476," I read that before, that is so crazy!  I wonder what other people that didn't work there think of them. ",Curious to dive deeper
476,Yeah I bet they think positively of them. A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send neil armstrong and 11 other astronauts to the moon. That is quite surprising.,Surprised
476," Holy cow, it's crazy how far tech has come.  Well it's been nice talking with you, I hope you have a good one!",Happy
477,Hi are you a big fan of google?  They have really became one powerful company.,Curious to dive deeper
477," I use Google every day.  It is hard not to.  When Google is down, almost all web traffic is down also.",Neutral
477,Yes!  I can't believe they have been around over 20 years already since be founded in 1998.,Happy
477," An innovative company, they are.  They once used live goats instead of people to mow their lawns!",Surprised
477," That is kind of neat.  I'm surprised I haven't seen that happen before.  When there is a disputed border, google maps will tailor their maps to the claims of each country where the interenet browser is located.  Weird and kind of odd fact.",Happy
477,Technology is progressing so rapidly.  I think it is an interesting that what we refer to as AI constantly changes.  What was considered AI before is normal now.,Neutral
477," AI has really come on strong in the last 2 years.  AI crushed all human records in the puzzle game ""2048"".",Happy
477,I think it is an important idea to focus on the human aspect as we become more technologically advanced.  That's the focus people in Silicon Valley are taking.,Neutral
477," I agree.  Facebook is developing an AI desinged to understand user emotions, identify objects in photos, and predict users actions.",Happy
477,I admire John Doerr for writing a book about how to make people work together more productively.,Neutral
477," I'm going to have to look that book up.  I'm not familiar with him or the book.  Speaking of books, I didn't know Kristen Stewart co-authored a paper about AI.",Happy
477," Yeah, you should read the book.  Learning how to make teams work together more productively is useful because companies perform better when their teams are more motivated I guess.",Neutral
477,I'm going to look it up when we're done here.  Are you a big Amazon user?  I am.,Curious to dive deeper
477," Yes, I use Amazon all the time.  I suppose it's hard not to use Amazon either.  They are the largest internet retailer in the world.",Neutral
477,I agree.  I didn't know that they also owned IMDB since 1998.  Probably so they could direct people to buy the movies over at Amazon. lol,Surprised
477," Yeah, it seems like they are grabbing the market anywhere they can, from books, entertainment, and much more.",Surprised
477," They even have their own in-house brand called AmazonBasics, which sells low-end products. ",Happy
477,They even control more than it seems because they are a cloud provider.  It's almost like they are becoming the internet.,Surprised
477,It's kind of sad that all these brick and mortar stores are closing because of all this technology.  Amazon has a contract with the US postal service to deliver packages on Sundays now too.  Pretty soon groceries will be coming to your doorstep too.,Happy
477,I think we should maintain a keen perspective on all the technologies that we are creating.  Risks and dangers should be constantly assessed.,Fearful
477,I agree.  I'm surprised at how many people are using the grocery shoppers now.  I was in Walmart the other day and I was amazed at how many workers were picking items for customers.  We know someone who does it and the Walmart they work at there is enough demand for 4 full time employees to do nothing but shop all day.  That to me is just craziness.  I have to get running.  I had a good time chatting with you.,Happy
477,Yeah I had a good time too.  Have a good day.  Bye!,Happy
478," lol, On april 18, 1930, the bbc decided there was no news worth reporting, so they broadcast piano music instead. Did You hear about that ?",Surprised
478,No I didn't ...I'd bet it was more soothing that  the news,Neutral
478," what do You mean, You don't like regular news ? ;)",Surprised
478," Absolutely not. News is often depressing, and I could stand without it. Now, toss on a piano song, or music....now you've got me. Though I hate classical music. Well, most of it.",Neutral
478,I wander if Brits were surprised when instead of news they got piano music instead ;) lol,Surprised
478," They may have thought they won the lottery. I'm an older dude, but give me a nice pounding Elton John or Billy Joel rocker on piano, and I'm rockin' away!",Happy
478," Hey I'm with You, I mean I'm only 37 but yeah... I'll take ""Piano man"" instead of news any day ;)",Happy
478," It makes me happy when a younger guy like yourself, I'm 61, still could listen to a good piano song. Didn't realize people your age still know what musical instruments are? Well, not that you're that young.",Happy
478," hey ! :) I'm young inside ;) but yeah... I listen to all kind of rock, blues and metal... Pink Floyd, Joe Bonamassa, Dire Straits, Metallica, Nirvana... and many more ;)",Happy
478,Nice! I used to be a DJ in clubs back in the day....remembered playing a ton of that stuff. Been to a lot of concerts?,Curious to dive deeper
478," Oh yes, I think I've beat my record last year... I saw Nick Cave twice, I won tickets to see Metallica, and I saw King Crimson for the first time. Oh, and I saw Joe Bonamassa too ;)",Happy
478," You got to see some good ones, that's for sure. I stopped going to concerts years ago!, but man....back in the 70's, seeing Pink Floyd, Bachman Turner Overdrive, Heart and Electric Light Orchestra on the same bill was fantastic....and it was only $15.00 a ticket.",Happy
478," Holy Crap ! ;) Now to see phil collins it's like $350 and those are not even good seats... ;) times changed, that's for sure...",Surprised
478," Yep. I wish the Factual Section 3 was Rock Music instead of Classical. The only story I have on classical music, is that I was a limo driver for an Arab shiek back in 2001. He bought me a 10 disco best of Classical artists box sex. Wasn't bad, but only listened to it once or twice. That's all I got on Classical music.",Neutral
478," I'm not too close to classical music, but I did like the soundtrack to Space Odyssey 2001 - it's as close to classical I got ;)",Happy
478," LOL....I hear ya. Oh, and sorry for the spelling, it was ""10 Disc"" and ""box set"" I meant. I'm gonna get killed for that....lol",Fearful
478," lol, yeah I figured that one out ;) although You never know with those Srab Sheik - they like to have a good time :)",Happy
478," LOL. So, let's see, I covered piano, concert, and classical. Anything else you'd like to bring up? Been nice chattin' with ya!",Happy
478," Something I'm sure You're aware of - In 1972, pink floyd recorded a live concert at the ancient roman amphitheater in pompeii...with no audience. I have that video ;) amazing piece :)",Happy
478," I've heard of it, but never knew it was filmed! I'm gonna hafta Youtube it and see if I can find anything on it...so I can watch a good sounding piano (keeping on the topic). ",Surprised
478,lol ;) that one was more psychodelic ;) not everybody likes stuff like that ;),Happy
478,No wonder there wasn't an audience for that concert.....lol.,Curious to dive deeper
478," lol ;) I loved it ! for those times, it was something truly amazing ! ;)",Happy
478,I'm gonna see if I can find that concert. I'd like to see it. Have a Great day!,Happy
478," You too, thank You for a great chat !",Happy
478,Absolutely....,Happy
478,Have a healthy New Year ;),Happy
479," Hi there, did you hear that Amazon pulled out of its decision to build its second headquarters in NY today?",Curious to dive deeper
479," I didn't hear that.  They have so many locations, and such a wide reach.  Jeff Bezos certainly has vision",Neutral
479," Yes, it's crazy that they started out as an online bookstore and now it's so big it's the largest internet retailer in the world",Disgusted
479,They even own imdb!,Neutral
479," I guess it makes sense that once they had that property, they'd move into streaming video and producing their own content with Amazon Studios",Neutral
479," They certianly have capitalized off their success, even getting USPS to deliver packages on sunday",Curious to dive deeper
479," Yes, and their own workers move a lot of packages, too. A warehouse workers walks between 7 and 15 miles over the course of a daily shift.",Neutral
479," That seems like a lot, I wonder how soon before they start replacing them with AI?",Neutral
479," It's only a matter of developing the technology to a point where the automation is cheaper. There is actually a non-profit organization for the advancement on AI, I wonder what kind of people contribute to that!",Neutral
479," Facebook is even in on the development of AI, trying to understand human emotion, and predict user actions.  It is almost there with the fact when you search for something you start to see ads for it on Facebook.  Re-targeting as become amazing that way",Curious to dive deeper
479," Yes, we're at the point where tasks like OCR are often excluded from AI because they've become such a routine technology.",Neutral
479,I personally am excited to see further development in the self driving car type of technology.,Neutral
479," I love driving, so I'm not personally excited to use that, but I think it's better than dealing with all of the distracted drivers on the road because they're looking at their phones. Google actually calculates traffic using the movement of Android devices on the road!",Neutral
479," I didn't know that.  Thats pretty cool, I was wondering how they got that info, I knew it couldn't be just people logged on to maps.",Neutral
479," Yes, I guess you have to watch what you agree to! I bet the some agreements are even drafted by AI",Neutral
479," Probably, those things I never read and now I owe them not only my soul, but all the winnings if I were to ever hit the lotto.  lol.  Ive heard Kristen Stewart co-authored a paper on AI",Surprised
479,That seems a bit ironic haha. Maybe she took Stanford's free class on AI that uses Google Plus Hangouts and shared her lovely personality.,Neutral
479,Lol.  Maybe she did.,Curious to dive deeper
479," Yes, it's a good thing Facebook has so many users and photos with which to train its AI to understand emotion and recognize objects",Neutral
479,It always gets me when I post photos that automatically tag me or my friends.,Curious to dive deeper
479," I guess the cost of a ""free"" product is privacy! Maybe part of the next frontier with AI is using it to create believable fake identities to trick other AI algorithms with lol",Neutral
479,That would be crazy.  Its been great chatting!,Neutral
479,Good night!,Neutral
480,Do you enjoy classical music?,Neutral
480," I do, I listen to classical music when Im working what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
480," I enjoy listening to classical music in a serene space, but did you know classical music concerts originally had loud wild audiences?",Neutral
480," I didnt thats a cool fact, another cool fact is that a computer composed a classical music master piece back in 2011",Curious to dive deeper
480," I wonder if it was any good? In any case, classical music isn't just music. Cities are using it to successfully deter crime in public space with remarkable results",Neutral
480,They are? that application is suprising and new to me have you attended any good concerts lately?,Curious to dive deeper
480,I recently attended Joe Hisaishi's concert. He has amazing melodies and it would be perfect music to listen to in a beautifully scenic place in nature,Neutral
480," I haven heard of that artist I might look him up in Youtube later today, there is a roman amphitheatre in Cratia that its still used for concerts, it would be amazing to attend a concert there",Curious to dive deeper
480," did you know creed concerts entered into 4 lawsuits, I think I would be fine",Neutral
480," Thats too bad Creed used to be a great band, do you like Linking Park?",Curious to dive deeper
480,They are pretty good and they even had 300+ concerts in 2001 alone due to their sucess,Neutral
480," Thats a lot of concerts for a year, I loved their first album it was a success indeed.",Curious to dive deeper
480,Speaking of concerts have you ever listened to the ramones? They played a total of 2000 concerts and toured for nearly 20 years,Neutral
480," I have too bad I didnt make it to any of their concerts, they are a really talented group.",Curious to dive deeper
480,I agree. Personally I am a fan of the piano for most songs,Neutral
480," Piano is a great instrument I really like it, it has such a relaxing tone, in the 30s the BBC network decided to broadcast piano music instead of the news",Curious to dive deeper
480,Did you know a group of climber reach britain's highest mountain peak and found a piano. Someone must really like the piano,Neutral
480," I agree I would be too busy getting freezed to play the piano, that must require a lot of hard physical work though.",Surprised
480,I sure respect Bartolomeo for inventing such a beautiful instrument so far back in the 1700s.,Neutral
480," Wow that was 300 years ago! the piano is an old instrument, there is also an aluminum grand piano",Curious to dive deeper
480,I didn't know that. In any case thank you for the chat. I am going to look up what the aluminum grand piano looks like after this chat.,Surprised
481,Have you ever visited Silicon Valley? I know that it's in California,Curious to dive deeper
481,I haven't. I am sure it is something to be seen.,Curious to dive deeper
481," You been to Google's headquarters? It is in Silicon Valley, they are the largest search engine in the world",Curious to dive deeper
481," No, but we have a big distribution center in my city and I have been there. Can you believe Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years?",Surprised
481,No that's a really crazy thing to build. What do you think about the fact that the first customer to buy something on Amazon got a building named after him,Surprised
481,I wish I was that person! When I was at Amazon I walked miles. Did you know that the workers walk between 7-15 miles each day. I believe it!,Surprised
481," Wow that is crazy that's a lot of calories to burn in a day! I'm just glad that Amazon has an exclusive contract with USPS to deliver on Sundays, that makes me happy",Happy
481,Me too! I see them out delivering all the time!,Curious to dive deeper
481," Yeah I've seen them too, do you ever use the site IMDb by the way?",Curious to dive deeper
481,Yes. When I want to find out more about a person who is in the entertainment industry.,Neutral
481," Yep I use that site almost everyday, it's crazy that Amazon owns them, they own almost everything LOL",Surprised
481,Yes they do. Do you think it is crazy that instead of hiring a lawn crew that google had goats mow the lawns.],Surprised
481,I do think that's crazy. But I guess it is environmentally friendly. corraling hundreds of live goats to mow a law is a crazy thing to try to do,Surprised
481,But effective! Did you know that google maps calculates traffic on how fast android devices are moving on the road. WHat about Apple people?,Curious to dive deeper
481," That is really interesting. I love how these companies can use AI now, do you know who Kristen Stewart is by the way?",Curious to dive deeper
481,Not sure? Who is she?,Curious to dive deeper
481,She's the actress from the Twilight movies. Apparently she even wrote a paper about artificial intelligence which I did not think she would be interested in,Surprised
481,I agree! I know who you are talking about now. That is kind of crazy! I heard that there is a non-profit org for the advancement of artificial intelligence.,Curious to dive deeper
481,Yeah I think you're right. It's all so crazy that Facebook is creating its own artificial intelligence to identify objects in photos,Surprised
481,They are on the cutting edge. That is really cool.,Curious to dive deeper
481," Yes I agree, they also want to be able to predict their users actions which is scary to me",Fearful
482,Winter is getting old.  I'm ready to see birds migrating back north from Mexico; that would be a welcome sight.,Happy
482," Yea birds are pretty interesting, i find their light weight skeleton fascinating ",Happy
482,It's hard to believe that their skeletons actually weigh less than their feathers with those hollow bones.,Surprised
482," Yea, they are quite successful species with over ten thousand species currently living",Neutral
482,I guess some in Australia can mimic lots of sounds like cameras and chainsaws.  Listening to them might be better than going to a Creed concert.  Some dissatisfied listeners once filed a lawsuit since a performance was so bad.,Curious to dive deeper
482,I don't blame them. The foo fighters once did a concert so loud it was recorded on New Zealand's seismic monitors,Neutral
482," Wow, that is loud!  But I'll bet it was fun.  I've never seen them live, but I have been to a few good amphitheatre shows: John Mellencamp, Tome, Petty, and KISS were really good.",Neutral
482," Apparently Deep Purple has the record for loudest concert, it left three audience members unconscious",Neutral
482," Holy cow, that had to be something.  Those classic acts had it going on.  The Ramones toured almost nonstop for 20 years; that is commitment to the craft, no doubt.",Neutral
482," That is impressive, they've must of made a lot of money but probably not as much Abba was offered to do a reunion tour, they turned down 1 billion dollars",Neutral
482," I did not know that.  For that kind of money, I think I could put grudges or reservations aside.  You could buy a lot of tacos for 1 billion dollars.",Neutral
482,Yea I never even thought Abba was that in demand to offer 1 billion to do 100 concerts,Surprised
482," I think I would pass on that one.  I didn't even know they were still all around.  Fame can take a toll on performers; Linkin Park was so awesome, but their lead singer faced demons and committed suicide.  So sad.",Sad
482,Yea that is unfortunate. Do you follow world events much. In 2010 there was a global tiger summit that russia pledged 330 million dollars to,Curious to dive deeper
482," I like keeping up on politics, but I did not know that fact.  However, I heard once that they gave out phone chargers and thumb drives infected with trojan viruses at one G20 summit.  That seems to go against the very nature of a summit.",Curious to dive deeper
482," Yes but I guess security is lacking at a lot of summits, in 2007 a man dressed as Osama bin Laden was able to get pass security of the Apec summit",Neutral
482,Really?  You would think that security might be a bit tighter at these things.  Especially with the heads of state from so many powerful countries there.  It's almost like inviting someone to harm world leaders.,Fearful
482,Yea but I guess security is hard to do with the increase in Summits since the end of the Cold War,Neutral
482," True, now there has been an increase in summit events since then, so it's probably harder to keep them all safe.  ",Neutral
482," Yea, they even have a summit on St Patrick's day where the Irish Prime Minister visits the US President",Surprised
482," Really, that is cool.  That one is probably low stress compared to one with Putin or leaders from China.  ",Neutral
482," Yea, especially the early ones with FDR, Stalin and Chruchill during WWII",Neutral
482," It would have been amazing to witness those.  Those were three strong, influential, history-changing leaders.  ",Curious to dive deeper
482," well i got to go, nice talking with you",Neutral
483,Are movies your kind of entertainment?,Curious to dive deeper
483,Yeah I like movies. Im particularly fond of Stehpen speilberg films.,Neutral
483," Do you have a favorite?  We just watched Empire of the Sun, it had a very young Christian Bale in it!",Surprised
483,I like the jurassic park movies a lot. Me and my son like watching stff like that he loves dinosars.,Happy
483," My son too, he keeps telling me when the new Jurassic movies are coming out, 2020 apparently.",Curious to dive deeper
483,Thats awesome. I hadnt heard abot a new one. Fnny thing about Speilberg. When he rode the jurassic park ride he asked to be let off before the 84 foot drop. I can nderstand what he is going through there thogh. Im not a big rollercoaster fan.,Happy
483," Same here.  My son loves Cedar Point in Ohio, we take him and he goes on all the big rides while I sit and watch.  I guess everyone seeks their own entertainment.",Neutral
483,Yeah I went on a roller coaster when i was little that did a flip. Then it went backwards and did the flip again. I have hated them ever sense.,Happy
483," I think I'll stick to the movies.  Have you ever seen the movie Moon?  It's about ten years old now, it was made by David Bowie's son Duncan Jones.",Curious to dive deeper
483,No I havent seen it is it good.,Happy
483,It's interesting in a small movie way.  Clever story with a nice twist at the end.,Neutral
483,Ill have to check it out. One of the earliest movies I an remember seeing is ET. My mom liked it when I was a kid.,Neutral
483," I remember that one when I was at school, I had to wait until it was on VHS.  I also recall be scared by Close Encounters, it took me nearly ten years to watch it.",Neutral
483,I wasnt one for scary movies either. My sister loved them even when she was a little kid. Did yo ever see Schindlers list.We watched that one in school.,Happy
483," Yes, I remember going with my dad.  It almost felt like we had to go.  It's amazing how a movie maker can go from big popcorn movies like E.T. to a serious movie such as Schindler's List.",Surprised
483,Yeah that movie was deep. I took an elective class in high school on the holocaust and we watched it. That was a screwed up time in history. Man the way they lined p the Jews and shot them in rows to save bullets. That always sticks out to me as a prime example of how sick and screwed up the Germans were at that time. Not worried about the lives they took at all just how many bullets they used doing it.,Disgusted
483," I know, it affected me a lot at the time.  I'd also recently been to Germany and seen one of those concentration camps.  I don't know how people can become like that.",Disgusted
483,I also remember the goonies. That ones a classic in my book. Speilberg flew the entire cast to Hawaii after they were done shootiIng Man they have made some money off that movie.,Happy
483,We just showed that one to the kids.  We had forgotten about all the swearing in it.  It's funny how memory works.,Surprised
483,Yeah it is. Well its been good talking to ya this morning. I got to be gettin ready for work. I dont want to though. Its cold out there.,Happy
483," Have a good day, bye",Neutral
484," Hi, how are you?",Happy
484,Me? i guess im pretty good. how are you doing? everything going all right? get enough to eat there? thats good. what do you think about the moon?,Neutral
484," I'm good, thanks for asking.  It's so overcast, I can't really see it tonight.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
484," i have not looked at the moon recently, but i think that it has been doing all right. The highest point on the moon is 1938 meters higher than mt. everest! I wonder if they have 3g and wireless up there.",Neutral
484," I doubt it, but you never know? Lol I hear moon dust can cut through Kevlar like material and is harmful to us humans.",Curious to dive deeper
484," boy, that is good to know. i never realized the dangers of visiting the moon. i guess ill wait until disney sets up a theme park there. when does spielberg make his first dinosaur moon movie?",Neutral
484," That's cool!  Well if anyone could make a movie like that it would be Spielberg.  He's made some good ones, Jaws, E.T. The Color purple,and Jurassic Park, just to name a few.",Surprised
484,dinosaurs on the moon. shot on location. that would be great! Summer was considered a bad time to release a movie in the theater because of low sales until Jaws.,Neutral
484," Now, it's the best time.  My how times change!  Did you know he played the clarinet on the Jaws soundtrack?",Curious to dive deeper
484,he is a gifted artist. i wonder how good his clarinet skills are. why did he get that gig? he made enough as the director.,Neutral
484,Can you say control?  I read he still makes millions from Star Wars off a bet he made with George Lucas in 1977.,Surprised
484," yes, that bet about star wars and close encounters. george really blew it on that one. that is funny. still george has billions. ",Neutral
484,What's a friendly wager among billionaire friends?,Surprised
484," at the time, they were not billionaires. but george learned the value of his franchise. he made a ton off other movies before though. ",Neutral
484," On a side note, do you know that when Caesar visited Britain a long time ago, he saw the people there not eating chickens , but using them as entertainment?",Curious to dive deeper
484,there was not much for entertainment there and then. i guess they had other sources of protein. maybe the britons bet on the chicks?,Neutral
484," I'm sure they were talking about cock fighting, still goes on today.  It's just illegal now if you get caught doing it! Lol Still, I think I would have fried up the under performing birds and watch the better fighters do their thang!",Surprised
484," the Britons probably ate something from chickens. maybe the eggs? I dunno. They did not have the NES for entertainment, so they had to use chickens.",Neutral
484," You know, that thing was only discontinued in Japan in 2003.  Hard to believe it held on so long, there!",Surprised
484,i think that the Japanese are die hard fans. they wanted to keep buying the games. i dont know why. there have been many better systems.,Neutral
484," Yes, you're right about that.  Well, it's been nice chatting.  Enjoy the rest of your evening.",Happy
485,What forms of entertainment do you enjoy?,Neutral
485,I like movies.  I really like Steven Spielberg movies like E.T. and Indiana Jones.  What do you like?,Neutral
485," I like most types of entertainment designed to give pleasure and delight such as storytelling, music, drama, and etc. However, I too like Steven Spielberg's movies.",Neutral
485,Entertainment definitely takes all forms.  Back in 50bc people in Britain bred chickens for entertainment.,Neutral
485,I wonder if that has anything to do with the mass produced meaty chickens of today? Personally I spent a lot of time with the Nintendo entertainment systems.,Neutral
485,I like Nintendo too.  I don't care that the NES could only display 54 colors. It's enough.,Neutral
485," Too bad it was finally discontinued in 2003, but it has had a long run. Aside from the NES, I also watched Bill nye the science guy when I was younger too",Neutral
485,I watch him now with the Planetary Society.  Did you know he won a Steve Martin lookalike contest?,Neutral
485," I would have never know. I also enjoyed many steven spielberg movies like ET, which you previously mentioned.",Neutral
485," Yeah, Spielberg is an excellent director.  This is a little known fact but he also directed some shows on tv.",Neutral
485,Did you know he still makes millions for a star wars on a bet with george lucas in 1977,Neutral
485,I didn't know that but I have to admit that it says a lot about George Lucas to still be paying on a bet from so long ago.,Surprised
485,I mean it really shows how close both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are as friends. It probably also helps that they are filthy rich.,Neutral
485,That's true.  Spielberg is a nice guy.  He flew the whole cast of goonies to Hawaii and had a cookout.,Neutral
485,I mean his hits are so amazing that he change the very concept that summer was a bad time to release movies due to historically low sales by releasing jaws and we both know how that turned out,Neutral
485," Now it's a major thing to release movies in the summer.  I just wish he'd go back to making the kind of movies he did before. I know he likes addressing issues in movies currently but I like adventure and fantasy.  Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a fanastic movie! I can still hear the ""musical communication"" with the alien ship!",Neutral
485," Speaking of jaws, did you know he personally played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack? I really like it when the creators participate directly in their creations.",Surprised
485,I didn't know that. I had no idea he could play an instrument for that matter.  I like it too when they do that.  You know Jaws is considered the first summer blockbuster.,Neutral
485," I did not, but it makes sense since it changed the very perception of best times to release movies.",Neutral
485,It really does.  Jaws planted a flag so to speak.  Just like NASA planting one on the moon.,Neutral
485," Indeed. In any case, it was a enjoyable chat, especially about Spielberg.",Neutral
485,Yes it was.,Neutral
486,Hi there! Have you ever had a pet bird?,Curious to dive deeper
486,No I haven't but I have memories of friends who did when I was growing up.  How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
486," Yes, I have had pet birds. I've had cockatiels, parakeets, and some fancier parrots when I was a kid. Did you know the famously extinct Dodo bird, is closely related to the pigeon?",Curious to dive deeper
486," That is awesome, so you are quite the bird expert.  I didn't know that, very interesting though.  ",Curious to dive deeper
486,Haha! I know a few fun facts about birds. Such as in most birds the bones are so hollow that the feathers weigh more than the entire skeleton!,Curious to dive deeper
486," That is awesome, I guess it makes sense though when you figure they have to be able to stay airborne. ",Curious to dive deeper
486," Apparently, humingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I was always curious how they built such strong little nests!",Curious to dive deeper
486," That is so cool, I love learning about how different species in nature interact with each other to help themselves. ",Curious to dive deeper
486," Yeah, we are learning so much about so many things, these days! There are birds in Australia that can mimic the sound of car alarms, cameras and chain saws. I wonder if they are mockingbirds.",Curious to dive deeper
486," That is awesome, and yeah good one.  I wonder why they would mimic them as well?",Curious to dive deeper
486," It's interesting, but I also find it kind of sad that they mimic human made objects. Birds are amazing to me! Some birds fly from Alaska to Mexico, without sleeping when migrating! ",Curious to dive deeper
486," That is amazing for an animal to do that, sleeping is necessary, some animals sleep for crazy periods of time!",Curious to dive deeper
486," It would be pretty neat if we evolved wings from our forelimbs! Birds are called Aves sometimes, which makes sense since we call large bird houses, aviaries.",Curious to dive deeper
486," That would be really wild, and I didn't know that, it does make sense though with the aviaries.  And, aviation is air stuff too. ",Curious to dive deeper
486," Ah yes, aviation as well! That one slipped my mind somehow! My favorite birds used to be penguins, but they almost don't even seem like birds to me!",Curious to dive deeper
486," I would agree, penguins seem like a different breed in general. I think birds are the closest living things to dinosaurs to be honest. ",Curious to dive deeper
486," Yeah, in hindsight and without DNA, if we'd have known that some have feathers and some fly, and some lay eggs. Maybe we could have put two and two together, after all!",Curious to dive deeper
486," That is probably true, I just think you can really tell when you look at a birds feet, they look like how dinos did. ",Curious to dive deeper
486,Oh yeah and their cute little legs! They all kind of remind me of tiny dinosaurs! Emus remind me of pretty big dinosaurs! I'd love to have one as a pet! Their eggs are huge compared to a chicken's eggs!,Curious to dive deeper
486," Yeah good call they sure do to me too!  And yeah those eggs are massive, I know people eat those and ostrich eggs. ",Curious to dive deeper
486," Yeah, it would be really interesting to taste an ostrich egg! Hey, it has been so nice chatting with you! I've got to get some chores done. I hope you have a wonderful day!",Happy
486," Ok sounds good, yeah it was fun, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day!",Happy
487,Do you enjoy dining at interesting restaurants?,Curious to dive deeper
487," Hello there, I do enjoy going yes, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
487," I do when I can. I'd like to visit Mi Vida, a beautifully designed restaurant in Washington DC.",Curious to dive deeper
487," It sounds really nice, and DC is a really fun place to visit I will say that as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
487,It's got torches on pedestals and it faces the water on the Wharf. The drinks sound yummy too.,Happy
487," Yeah they do, and fresh guacamole is always so good. ",Curious to dive deeper
487,I'd try chipotle infused tequila with my guac and chips!,Happy
487," Yeah that also sounds super good, I love tequila!",Curious to dive deeper
487," Have you had queso fundido? It's like Mexican fondue, yum!",Curious to dive deeper
487,Yeah I have tried that before and it is really good I would agree!,Curious to dive deeper
487," Unfortunately it seems the service at the restaurant is not so great. That is one of the most important things, for me.",Sad
487," Oh for sure, I have worked at a restaurant and it takes some skill to be good, but if not, bad service is the worst!",Curious to dive deeper
487," I'm getting hungry. I'd love some chicken. Chicken is the only bird I would eat, even at a fancy restaurant.",Happy
487," I like chicken as well.  Speaking of birds, did you know that they have regional accents?",Curious to dive deeper
487," That is funny. I think I had heard that about cows, too. So like moo, meh, mewww? Haha Speaking of birds though, hummingbirds are smart. They steal spidewebs to fix their nests and to make new ones.",Surprised
487," I think I have read about that, very cool, would be fun to watch video of them doing it. ",Curious to dive deeper
487,I bet they are really light. Most birds' bones are so hollow that the skeleton weighs less than the feathers.,Surprised
487," That is very interesting, I think they are the closest relatives to the dinosaurs as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
487,Neat! And the dodo is also a close relative to the pigeon.,Surprised
487," Yeah it is!  Oh the dodo, I remember watching old videos of the dodo years ago. ",Curious to dive deeper
487," Birds are persistent too. Some can fly from Alaska to Northern Mexico without sleeping when they are migrating. Speaking of sleep, I'd love to take a nap! It was nice talking to you!",Happy
488,Did you know about the wild birds in Australia and their pecularity?,Curious to dive deeper
488,Can't say that I have. What about them?,Curious to dive deeper
488," Well they mimic the sound of car alams, chainsaws and also cameras, ",Curious to dive deeper
488," Oh, that sounds like the lyre birds. I guess I have heard of them. Birds are neat. The reason they can fly is thanks to their almost hollow skeleton.",Surprised
488," That must be really funny to listen at lol, you know that birds have bones that are so hollow they can even weigh more than their feathers",Curious to dive deeper
488," I believe it, especially when some of them are only two inches long. Can you imagine being so lightweight?",Happy
488," It would be graet to fly, thats something I can imagine, I bet the dodo bird was a magestic animal",Curious to dive deeper
488,That depends. Do you consider pigeons majestic? Dodos are actually part of the pigeon family.,Happy
488," No, not really, but Dodo seem to be a lot different than pigeons, do you know that some birds travel really long distances without sleeping!!",Curious to dive deeper
488,Like when they migrate?,Curious to dive deeper
488," Yeah exactly, when they migrate from Alska to the northern region of Mexico",Curious to dive deeper
488,I'm glad that all birds don't migrate. Think of a 9 foot ostrich flying past in the sky!,Surprised
488," That would be funny to watch, I like hummingbirds, spiders must hate them!",Happy
488,Why do you say that?,Curious to dive deeper
488," Because hummingbirds steal spiderwebs from them, to construct their own nests, that would make me angry",Curious to dive deeper
488," Understandably so! There's close to ten thousand different bird species, so those spiders had better look out.",Surprised
488," They must if they want to keep their webs lol, do you like Linkin Park?",Curious to dive deeper
488,Can't say that I'm much of a fan. I was sad to hear about Chester though.,Sad
488," Yeah that was really sad, maybe the 2001 tour got to him, they played 324 concerts that year alone",Curious to dive deeper
488,That's quite the tour. I wonder if all those stops finally took a toll on him.,Sad
488," I bet they did, all those concerts, drugs and then fame. ",Curious to dive deeper
489,Do you like audiobooks?,Curious to dive deeper
489," Yes, do you? I enjoy them a lot!",Happy
489," I do like them, it saves me a lot of time, I usually listen to one on the way to work, Katharine Graham memoir seems like a good pick",Curious to dive deeper
489," Yes, it looks very interesting. I think I will enjoy it. All the cover-ups!",Happy
489," I agree, theres a lot of interesting stories in her memoirs, like anecdotes about ''The Post'', ''The Iron Lady'', I might buy it and pick it as my next audiobook",Curious to dive deeper
489,Thats good. The Wife Between us sounds like a drama! Would have to be in the mood for that.,Neutral
489," I like the plot, it seems a bit dark, an abused ex-wife  stalking her former husband, thats an odd couple",Curious to dive deeper
489," yes, I like period pieces, so the Revolution of the Moon sounds interesting!",Curious to dive deeper
489," That is a great book and Andrea Camilleri is a great author, I like her style,, ",Curious to dive deeper
489," Good, I love anything on the solar system, the moon, saturn etc. Do you?",Curious to dive deeper
489," I am in love with the moon, its so beautiful, I envy the astronauts that could see earth from up there, a unique landscape indeed",Curious to dive deeper
489," Agree, So glad Nasa made the right choice putting the US flag and not the UN flag!",Angry
489," Yeah, after all NASA is American and its our achievement, you know there might be life on Titan",Curious to dive deeper
489," I saw that, I think there are other earths out there, so exciting!",Curious to dive deeper
489," That is exciting! there must be other moons like ours then, you know that moon dust cuts through kevlar and is extremely harmful to us",Curious to dive deeper
489," I know, can't imagine surviving that moon hay fever.Have you road the Jurassic park ride  or jaws?",Curious to dive deeper
489," No seems like a scary ride, too much for me, why do you ask?  I bet you have",Curious to dive deeper
489," Yes, love the rides and the movies. Especially when my kids were little.  Star wars opening soon at Hollywood studios. Do you like the movies?",Curious to dive deeper
489," I do like Star Wars and also movies one of my favorite directors is Steven Spielberg, he has so much talent",Curious to dive deeper
489," Agree, did you play Nintendo? didn't know Bill Nye was a look alike for Steve Martin?",Curious to dive deeper
489," They look alike thats funny lol, and Yeah I play nintendo I have the original system at home I bought one before they discontinued it back in 2003",Curious to dive deeper
490," hi, do you attend concerts?",Curious to dive deeper
490," Hi, how are you? Sometimes, when I have the money. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
490," Yeah me too , same here. Do you know Linkin Park?",Curious to dive deeper
490," I've heard the name. They're a band, right?",Neutral
490,Yes a famous one . They held 324 concerts in 2001,Curious to dive deeper
490,They must not have slept. I guess it's good to be young!,Neutral
490," Yeah I guess so. How about Ramones, do you know them?",Curious to dive deeper
490," The Ramones are legendary, but I've never seen them live.",Neutral
490,They have played concerts for 20 years straight,Curious to dive deeper
490,I guess they love touring! I would get exhausted!,Neutral
490," Yeah me too, so many concerts though, 2263 of them",Curious to dive deeper
490,I wonder if anyone follows the band around. Pink Floyd recorded a concert in an empty amphitheater. What is that about?,Neutral
490,Yeah I wonder too. A creed concert was so disliked four people sued them,Curious to dive deeper
490,They should probably have practiced in front of an empty stadium first.,Neutral
490,Yesh that would be better for them. in crotia there is such a theatre too and I wonder who has played there,Curious to dive deeper
490,I don't know if Croatia is a big destination for bands. Maybe Creed could start their tours there.,Neutral
490,I am not sure either. do you have a favorite instrument?,Curious to dive deeper
490," Uh, I guess the guitar? What about you?",Neutral
490,Yeah me too I like it. did you know mercury and mccartney used the same guitar once?,Curious to dive deeper
490,I think it was the piano. Freddie played the piano.,Neutral
490," Yeah that is correct, the piano. so cool though, two legends.",Curious to dive deeper
490," There must be magic in that piano. Well, I enjoyed chatting!",Neutral
490,same here.,Happy
491,So do you go to a lot of concerts?,Curious to dive deeper
491,I actually do!  Love music and going to concerts!  Do you like Linkin Park?  They played 324 concerts in 2001 alone.  That's a lot of shows in one year!,Happy
491,Yes it is. I don't like them though. I'm more of a country person.,Happy
491," Country is good too!  I was never much of a Ramones fan but they toured almost non stop for 20 years playing a total of 2,263 concerts.  That's a crazy high number of shows.",Happy
491,Definitely! I've never heard of them though. Did you know that Creed was sued in 2002 because their concert was so bad?,Curious to dive deeper
491,I didn't know that!  They must have been really really bad. lol  There's an old ancient Roman amphitheatre in Croatia that's still used as a concert venue.  That would be neat to see.,Happy
491,Yes it would. Do you play piano. I love it but can't play it.,Curious to dive deeper
491,I like it and tried several times when I was younger but couldn't get the hang of it. In 1930 there was no news worth reporting so the BBC decided to just play piano music instead.,Happy
491,That is something. I am astonished that someone managed to get a piano on top of Britain's highest mountain lol.,Surprised
491," Wow.  Wondered how in the heck they did that?  I couldn't even imagine taking on that task.  Both Freddie Mercury and Paul McCartney used the same piano to record their hits ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and ""Hey Jude"".  That's kind of neat.",Happy
491,Yes it is. I love both those songs. I love Paul McCartney on the piano. He can make those keys sing I think. Imagine putting an aluminum grand piano on an airship and it weighing only 356 pounds. Wow!,Surprised
491,That's neat that it was made out aluminum!  I wonder if it was on the Hindenburg when it crashed?,Curious to dive deeper
491,That's probable. I don't know a lot about the violin but there are definitely a lot of variations of it.,Neutral
491,Yes.  It country music they call it a fiddle!,Happy
491,Yes. That's about the only thing I don't like in Country music lol. The music from them just hits me the wrong way.,Neutral
491,It does give it a distinctive sound though.  lol  There is violin that is made out of stone that is playable.,Happy
491,Wow! makes you wonder how thats possible. I'm very surprised that Einstein played both the violin and piano. I never knew that.,Surprised
491," He was a genius.  Joseph Haydn, who was a classical composer, one wrote a piece where the musicians gradually leave the stage until only 2 violins are left.",Happy
491,I wonder what that piece is like. And in blind tests modern violins were preferred over million-dollar stradivarius violins when sound tests were blind.,Surprised
491,That would be hard to tell apart I would think.  Larry Fine from the 3 Stooges burned his arm as a child and took violin lessons to strengthen his arm.,Happy
491,That's horrible that that happened. I love the three stooges. It must take a lot of strength in your arms to play that then.,Surprised
491,I love them to!  I still will try to watch them from time to time just to get a good laugh.,Happy
491,Yes I know. My kids don't know what to think about black and white tv shows. I love them though.,Happy
491,I think they're still good.  I enjoy the Little Rascals too.  It was nice chatting with you today!,Happy
492,Hey there have you ever been to a concert before? I know I go to them all the time,Curious to dive deeper
492,Unfortunately I've never been to a concert! I would love to go to one soon.,Happy
492," Wow you've never been to a concert? you need to go to one ASAP LOL, maybe go to a The Ramones concert Sunday? Apparently they've been touring for almost 20 years straight, I bet their show is really good",Surprised
492," That is crazy! My mom really likes them, maybe I'll be able to take her. ",Happy
492," Yes you should! She would love it LOL. I would also go to a Linkin Park concert, although I think they're singer passed away, back in 2001 they did like 324 concerts in only a year, that's like one per day almost",Surprised
492," I grew up listening to Linkin Park and it hurt me when I found out Chester died. That is a lot of concerts, wow. ",Surprised
492," Yep I agree with you. Would you ever watch a concert in an ancient Roman Amphitheater? Apparently Pink Floyd did a concert there, and there is one in Croatia that still does concerts to this day",Curious to dive deeper
492," That is insane, I think I would watch it just to experience it. I don't know if you know who Creed is, but apparently they were sued by four concert goers because their 2002 concert was really bad.",Happy
492," That's pretty funny haha. I would actually be embarrassed if I were them, do you play any instruments by the way? I personally play the piano",Curious to dive deeper
492," I know right! I don't really play any instruments, I use to play on a piano when I was a kid though.",Happy
492," Yeah I play the piano, I start to learn as an adult, I actually like it a lot. I didn't know that back in 1930, there was a day where there was literally no news and so the BBC just played piano music instead haha",Surprised
492," Oh cool, I'm glad you enjoy it. I'm surprised there was no news, that is crazy.",Surprised
492," I know right. You would never see that today, they're always coming out with news about something, do you like Queen by the way?",Curious to dive deeper
492," Absolutely, he is a legend!",Happy
492," I agree with you! Apparently the piano used in Bohemian Rhapsody, is the same one Paul McCartney used for the song Hey Jude, I do like both songs haha what about you",Curious to dive deeper
492," I do too, it's really cool to know the same piano was used. If you ever think about climbing a mountain, maybe try Britain's highest mountain, you can play piano up there! ",Happy
492," I should do that! And put it on YouTube haha. I wonder how it got up there too, do you know what the Airship Hindenburg was?",Curious to dive deeper
492,I have no idea. What is it?,Curious to dive deeper
492," It was that giant blimp thing, remember it like exploded in the air, but apparently they had a piano on it and since it had to float, they used aluminum to create the piano, it only weighed 356 lb., I know that a real piano weighs a lot more than that",Surprised
492," Wow, that is so interesting, I really had no idea that happened! I knew about a violin that was made out of stone, and guess what, it's playable! ",Happy
492," That's cool! I always wanted to play the violin, I just heard it's really hard, it makes sense that Albert Einstein would play both the piano and violin haha",Surprised
493," Hi, how are you? Are you a music fan?",Curious to dive deeper
493," I listen to music whenever I can! I haven't been to a concert in a minute, but I tend to really enjoy those when it's an act I'm a fan of. I can appreciate orchestra, too, though.",Neutral
493," Same, I do like some orchestra stuff like John Williams and the guy who does the Game of Thrones music. Can't say I would ever go to an orchestra festival like Shift though.",Neutral
493," Festivals can be very stimulating but also very underwhelming or disappointing if they're not organized correctly. It sounds like Shift was not executed as well as it could have been, even if it was well-intended.",Neutral
493," I think I haven't been to a concert myself in over 5 years, the last one being the Foo Fighters.",Neutral
493," I saw REO Speedwagon and Chicago back last summer, and it reminded me that those shows are NOT fun if the music isn't loud. I heard the Foo Fighters played a concert so loud in New Zealand that it registered on seismic monitors!",Neutral
493," That's awesome! I saw the first Global Citizen concert in Central Park that had Foo Fighters, Black Keys and Neil Young. That one was amazing. Huge venue in the park.",Happy
493," That sounds fun--I guess that's kind of the ultimate venue for a festival. I was invited to a house concert last month and turned it down because it didn't sound fun, but there's a huge range in the kind of places you can have one. I suppose intimate venues work well for solo performances or ensembles involving instruments like pianos or violins.",Neutral
493,Have you ever been to cgbg in NYC? The Ramones used to play there back in the day pretty often.,Curious to dive deeper
493," I'm familiar with both, but I think I'm too young to have experienced either of those things live haha. ",Neutral
493," Me too, but I've been to cgbg before it closed down. I imagine the Ramones played a lot of similar punk rock scenes. I think I'm too old for a venue like that now haha.",Happy
493," I guess the concerts that take place today aren't really the stuff of legend. For example, in 1972, Deep Purple broke the world record for loudest concert, in which three audience members were rendered unconscious. I can't see that happening today.",Neutral
493,Haha that's crazy. Do you like Creed?,Curious to dive deeper
493," Oh, God, I remember them being popular back in the day and people not realizing that they were basically Christian rock haha.",Neutral
493,Haha yeah it was so obvious they were Christian rock even with their hits but it took people a while to catch on. Apparently they were so bad that after one concert they were sued by 4 people who went for it going so poorly lol,Happy
493,I guess those people really didn't know what was up! Although musicians can be tricky; once Dave Matthews was picked up by an audience member on the way to his own concert when he became stranded riding his bicycle.,Neutral
493,Haha that's seems like something that would only happen for a Dave Matthews concert. Is Dave Matthews still around?,Curious to dive deeper
493," I assume he's still alive--God knows he'd be able to sell out a tour as Gen Xers become nostalgic for the 90s. DMB would make a ton of money, although I'm not sure they'd get a $1 billion offer for 100 reunion concerts like Abba did.",Neutral
493,Haha what? Abba got offered a 1 billion for 100 reunion concerts? No way. I can't even name one Abba song.,Curious to dive deeper
493,They only get played at wedding receptions so the old people have something that they remember haha. I would have taken the money while that audience is still alive! It's probably the other half of the demographic who would go to the Shift classical music festival.,Neutral
493,Haha! So they didn't take the money?,Neutral
493," Apparently not, I guess those royalties are still pretty lucrative or they actually hate each other that much. Nice chatting!",Neutral
494," Festivals are really nice I remember going with my parents when I was a kid, really fun",Happy
494,Which festivals did you go to?,Neutral
494," Just local festivals, I want to go to The Shift festival of American Orchestras, that seems like quite a show",Curious to dive deeper
494,Could you tell me more about the Shift Festival? I heard the main focus was creativity,Neutral
494," I sure can, so 4 American orchestras are playing on the festival, the music is great and presenters a re good as well, all the orchestras are famous and skilled so I can see why the main focus is creativity",Curious to dive deeper
494,Who were some of the present artists?,Neutral
494," National Symphony Orchestra, Albanys Symphony, Fort Worths Symphony and theres even dancers from the texas ballet",Curious to dive deeper
494,That sounds like quite the lineup. Do you enjoy going to such events like concerts?,Neutral
494," It does sound like an interesting lineup, worth every penny, and yeah I like concerts",Curious to dive deeper
494,Any in particular you want to or wished you went to?,Neutral
494," I regret not going to a Linking Park concert, that is one of my favorite bands, they performed 324 concerts in 2001 and I couldnt make it",Curious to dive deeper
494,That is a lot of concerts in one year. I wanted to go hear the ramones who toured almost 20 years nonstop with over 2000 concerts under their belt,Neutral
494," Thats a lot of concerts as well, they must have spent all their time touring, travelling around the world.",Curious to dive deeper
494," Ya. Personally as long as it's not a creed concert or heavy metal, I think I would enjoy it",Neutral
494," Yeah I heard Creed had a terrible concert back in 2002, they even got sued because of their poor performance",Curious to dive deeper
494,And it wasn't even once!,Neutral
494," 4 concert goers sue the band, you know theres an ancient amphitheatre in Croatia that is used as a concert venue still",Curious to dive deeper
494,That sure sounds like an amazing place to hold a concert,Neutral
494," I know right, a lot of history present at the amphitheatre, Pink Floid hold a concert without an audience once",Curious to dive deeper
494,They did that at the roman amphitheater right? I wonder if just no one came or if they just wanted to play at such an amazing venue for themselves. I know I would,Neutral
494," Yeah that happened at a roman amphitheater, it was back in the year 1972.",Curious to dive deeper
495,Hello! How are you tonight?,Curious to dive deeper
495,Im doing great now that the server is back up. How are you?,Neutral
495,You and me both haha. I'm doing well myself! Have you been to many concerts?,Curious to dive deeper
495,i used to go to concerts when i was younger. dont have the time or money now. LOL You?,Neutral
495,Haha same here! What's your favorite one that you remember?,Surprised
495,I saw Rush a couple of times. that was great. they were so good live.,Neutral
495,I bet! Can you believe Linkin Park did 324 concerts in 2001 alone?,Surprised
495,I cant imagine having that much energy. they must have slept on the bus. how could they do that?,Neutral
495,Pure adrenaline probably haha. They could have been like the Ramones touring for 20 straight years. I wonder how many concerts they put on?,Curious to dive deeper
495," Probably over 100 a year, so about 2000? ",Neutral
495,It looks like 2263 in total! You were close! At least they weren't as bas a Creed doing concerts lol.,Surprised
495,Is Creed a christian rock band? it sounds religious.,Neutral
495,They were some terrible rock group in the early 2000s. They were sued once for putting on a terrible show!,Curious to dive deeper
495," Wow, i guess they should have rehearsed a bit before touring. that is terrible. i wonder if the fans won their suit.",Neutral
495,I hope they did because they were really bad haha. Do you play any instruments?,Surprised
495,I used to play the guitar. i dont play much now. You?,Neutral
495,I've been getting into the piano. I didn't realize it's only been around since 1700.,Curious to dive deeper
495," Yeah, it is a complex instrument. it has a lot of moving parts. ",Neutral
495,I want to see the piano used by both Freddie Mercury and Paul McCartney sometime! That would be awesome.,Surprised
495," I bet there is some magic in those keys. You could write a hit song! Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
495," I hope so lol. Great chat as well, have an awesome night!",Surprised
496," Good Afternoon!  I love going to concerts, seeing my favorite bands, music live - how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
496," Hello, I do as well though I don't get to go often. I have been to a few recitals in my day too.",Curious to dive deeper
496," I used to go to shows a lot more that I do now, kids and family will have that affect!  And, I like smaller venues - definitely not areas or stadiums!",Curious to dive deeper
496,I prefer smaller settings as well though I would love to attend a concert in an amphitheater. In Croatia there is a roman amphitheater that they still use as a concert venue.,Curious to dive deeper
496," Nice!  Europe has so much history and the engineering / architecture was so great, that doesn't surprise me that a venue would still be in use - amazing!",Surprised
496," True. In 72, Pink Floyd recorded a live concert at the amphitheater in Pompeii with no audience at all.",Curious to dive deeper
496,That's strange - makes me wonder if you play a concert for no audience - is it really a concert?,Curious to dive deeper
496,Good question. Are you a fan of Creed's music? Four people at one of their concerts in 2002 sued them because it was so bad. Yikes!,Curious to dive deeper
496," I am not a Creed fan, or that genre.  So I can totally understand why fans would be disappointed enough to sue - but honestly, what were they expecting?!!?!?!?",Surprised
496,I guess the opposite of that would be Linkin Park who played 324 concerts just in 2001. They were definitely a success back in the day.,Curious to dive deeper
496," Pretty sure I was at at least one of those LP shows in '01.  It's a shame that the lead singer is gone, he was from around here...",Sad
496,How cool! Have you heard of the Ramones? Apparently they toured almost 20 years non stop.,Curious to dive deeper
496," Of course - a little before my time, but very influential in the Rock/Punk Rock scene.  Ramones kinda started the live rock scene in NYC - or at least were the kings of it for some time",Curious to dive deeper
496," Wow, I had never heard of them. Do you play any musical instruments? Piano/violin?",Neutral
496,I do not - you mentioned that you had been to recitals in the past.  What type of recitals / instruments were featured?,Curious to dive deeper
496,I had a few friends who were music majors in college. I attended a lot of piano recitals mainly. Einstein was a musician as well and played the piano and violin very well.,Curious to dive deeper
496," Interesting!  I began to enjoy piano composers later in life, not sure why exactly.  Chopin and Vivaldi are some of my favorites!",Happy
496,A friend of mine in Cali has a baby grand in her house. They had to use a crane to get it in their house and also remove a whole glass wall on one side of the house. Course not as big as the grand piano built on the airship Hindenburg.,Curious to dive deeper
496,Fascinating - they had a grand piano on the Hindenburg?  Maybe that's why she went down!?!?!?,Surprised
496,Well it was aluminum and only weighed about 356 pounds!!,Curious to dive deeper
496," I guess you(me) really do learn something new everyday!  In case this chat ends unexpectedly, it was really great chatting with you today!",Surprised
496," Same here, have a great day!",Neutral
497,Did you know there is a company that has robot dogs for sale?,Curious to dive deeper
497,I did not. What's it all about?,Curious to dive deeper
497,It's Boston Dynamics and the dogs can do things like open doors and empty the dishwasher.,Surprised
497," Oh, I have heard of a German company that is making a dog like robot  called Spot Mini.",Curious to dive deeper
497,Hm. The one I mentioned can haul 30 pounds and may be used to work in dangerous environments like nuclear clean up.,Surprised
497,That would be great! It sounds like Spot Mini that is 66 pounds and 2 feet 9 inches tall.,Happy
497,Wow.  I heard it can also move on surfaces that wheeled robots cant.,Surprised
497,It sounds useful. I've also heard it can haul a 30 pound payload.,Surprised
497,Yes.  Did you know Michael Jackson planned to build a 50 foot robot to roam around the desert near Las Vegas?,Curious to dive deeper
497," No, I did not!",Surprised
497,Yeah and robots can be controlled by rat brains?  It will change personalities with the change of brains.  Wowl,Surprised
497,Wow! I know robot movement is so precise that they can debone a chicken with surgical precision.,Surprised
497,That precise yet the military uses Xbox controllers to disarm and ID IEDs.,Surprised
497," Really? Wow! I wonder if they learned that skill on Youtube? Especially since users can upload, share, view and rate videos.",Surprised
497," Probably... Why not?  Police have ""BluTube"" to share videos. ",Surprised
497,I have never heard of that! Do they share law enforcement videos?,Surprised
497,Yep.  Did ya know YouTube is the 2nd largest search engine on the internet?,Curious to dive deeper
497,I am not surprised. I know Netflix and Youtube combined make up half of peak internet traffic in north America.,Surprised
497," Yeah, computers have changed things a lot.  A far cry from 1936 when the Russians built a computer that ran on water.",Surprised
497,I never knew! Gangam style got so many views they had to upgrade the view count integer to 64 bits.,Surprised
497,Hey thanks. You were an excellent chat partner!,Neutral
498," hey there, do you like robots?",Curious to dive deeper
498," I think they are pretty fascinating, actually the term robotics was invented by scifi writer Issac Asimov.  What about you?",Happy
498,Even Michael jackson took deep interest in robots.,Surprised
498," Robots can be made to look human or not, which do you prefer?  I don't really mind them taking human form but in the end they are just machines.",Curious to dive deeper
498,I know so I am not sure why the need for them to look like humans,Surprised
498," Apparently Boston Dynamics is making a 4 legged dog robot named SpotMini, so now they are creating a market for pet robots too.",Neutral
498,cool. they have trained robots to debone a chicekn with surgical precision,Surprised
498," There are clips on YouTube about SpotMini.  It is a bit special since it is not wheeled it can move across all kinds of terrain,",Surprised
498,That is so cool maybe I should check it out to see what it is all about,Curious to dive deeper
498,That is the joy of computers because we can access all this information.  And now they are controlling all kinds of industrial and consumer devices!,Happy
498,True. the us military uses xbox 30  controllers to control theur eod robots,Curious to dive deeper
498," That is awesome.  I believe that robotics can help those who are handicapped, for instance a robotic arm a person could control with their thoughts.",Happy
498,Exactly. ANd now they make exoskeletons that can help people stand up. so cool,Curious to dive deeper
498,The scary part will be when a robot starts to think on its own instead of what has been programmed.  We don't want a real life Megatron!,Surprised
498,That is true. Do you weatch lots of videos of robst and other on yoututube ?,Curious to dive deeper
498,Sometimes I do.  Youtube basically has any topic you can think of.  The very first video was a guy talking about an elephant if you can believe that.,Surprised
498,And now they have everything in there. it is the largest search engine on the net,Surprised
498,Well yeah they ended up getting bought by Google in 2006 and added the power of Google's search engine so that make sense for sure.,Surprised
498,yeah. originally they had a lower view count but were forced to upgarde it after gandnam style song,Curious to dive deeper
498," Now all kinds of networks like CBS, BBC and Hulu use it for their content.  But you can always watch Bob Ross instead.",Happy
498," I love Bob Ross, what a legend. It was nice chatting with you",Happy
499,Do you like fish?,Curious to dive deeper
499," I love fish, looking at them and eating them also",Curious to dive deeper
499,Did you know a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck?,Curious to dive deeper
499," that is so interesting, I wonder why they declared that a fish if it is the only one with a neck",Curious to dive deeper
499," I'm not sure, what about eels? ",Curious to dive deeper
499," Eels are scary, I always remember the little mermaid when I think of eels, lol. What do you think about them?",Curious to dive deeper
499,Not much. Did you know there is a jellyfish that is immortal?,Curious to dive deeper
499,I would not want to cross paths with that. I think there has to be something that could kill it.,Curious to dive deeper
499," I'm not sure, I don't think that can be real, can it? ",Curious to dive deeper
499," I don't think so, maybe I will look it up lol. One thing I wouldnt cross either is the black swallower fish, have you heard of that one?",Curious to dive deeper
499," Me either. What about shoes, any interest? ",Curious to dive deeper
499," I love my shoes! I like nike mostly, how about you",Curious to dive deeper
499," I'm more of an adidas fan, but I have some Nikes. ",Curious to dive deeper
499,Did you ever have the stephon marbury shoes back in the day?,Curious to dive deeper
499," No, but I had some air jordans? ",Curious to dive deeper
499," Nice, I love air jordans. The marbury shoes were sold at Steve and Berrys for like 15 dollars each. They both don't exist anymore",Curious to dive deeper
499," Wow, that is pretty cheap, is that on an inflation adjusted basis? ",Curious to dive deeper
499," I am sure they are more costly now on ebay since they are so rare. Marbury promoted them when he was a star NBA player and never took a dime to endorse them, pretty cool",Curious to dive deeper
499," Yeah interesting. Well, I didn't know that Apple had a clothing line in 1986, did you? ",Curious to dive deeper
499," I did not know that, that would be some cool clothing to wear, I think I may go check it on ebay. It was so nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
499," Yeah, pretty funny right? Well, nice chatting!",Happy
500,Hello.  Did you vote in the mid term election?,Curious to dive deeper
500,Hi yes I did. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
500,I did. I think it is very important for all of us to vote.,Curious to dive deeper
500,It is important. I also like trivia about politics. Did you know that the senate used the same gavel for 165 years until Richard Nixon cracked it?,Curious to dive deeper
500,I heard about it.  Why did Nixon crack the gavel? He was not supposed to use it.,Curious to dive deeper
500,I doubt that he did it on purpose. He probably just got carried away. But I'll bet he felt pretty bad.,Curious to dive deeper
500," I said earlier that voting is important.  In India, they went even further.  They set up a polling booth in a forest full of lions just to give one person the opportunity to vote.",Surprised
500,I don't think we would go that far do you?,Curious to dive deeper
500," No, I do not think so.  Did you hear about the senate and their candy drawer?  ",Curious to dive deeper
500," Yeah, it must be nice. But I guess you have to give some of them free candy just to show up. Look at the Senator they had to drag in by his feet in 1988.",Curious to dive deeper
500," Yes, I heard the obscure rule that was invoked by a US senator.  Do you know which senators got arrested and forced to come to the chamber to vote?",Curious to dive deeper
500,No,Curious to dive deeper
500," Oh, okay.  I accept your explanation.  ",Happy
500,Did you know astronauts voted from space. Not surprising when you consider some other voters are lost in space.,Neutral
500," Yes, I heard.  I don't how how they do it though because they cannot just say it to the people on the ground.",Curious to dive deeper
500,That's a good point. Did you hear that Austin Texas voted to rename their garbage dump after fred durst. I wonder what he did?,Curious to dive deeper
500,Texans were going to vote.  Did it pass?  I do not know who Fred Durst is or was.  I'm sure it was someone important to Texans.,Curious to dive deeper
500,Yes they voted to rename the dump. I'm thinking he must have been a corrupt politician or something. It's not exactly an honor.,Curious to dive deeper
500,You are right.  It should not be an honor.  I do not want my name to be on a garbage dump.  I will research further out of curiosity.,Happy
500," I think I will too. Nice chatting with you, have a good night.",Neutral
500,Nice chatting with you too.,Happy
500,Thanks.,Neutral
501,Hi there did you know that the US Senate used the same gavel for 165 years?,Curious to dive deeper
501,I think I heard about that! And then one day Richard Nixon broke it LOL he truly is the master in the art of ruining things LOL,Surprised
501,To Funny! Apparently the Senate set up a rule that the Sargent of Arms could round up missing members and carry them into the Senate chamber.,Curious to dive deeper
501," Wow that's interesting. You know what I want to do though? I want to raid the candy desk that's in the Senate, they have a lot of good stuff like milky Way's and Mars Bars and jelly beans lol those are my favorite",Surprised
501," Right, haha! It's a shame that women weren't allowed to wear pants on the Senate floor. At least not until 1993, wow!",Curious to dive deeper
501," That is insane! I'm glad that they fix that because that seems really silly, also I like Michael Jordan's quote. he says that he won't endorse a Democratic candidate because""Republicans buy shoes to""I wish more celebrities would follow in his footsteps",Curious to dive deeper
501," That's some kind of sentiment, kind of confusing, why not just say he's a Republican, lol!",Curious to dive deeper
501,Haha that's true. How often do you vote by the way? Did you know that astronauts vote from space?,Surprised
501," Wow that's pretty cool. The indian Government set up a polling booth in the forest, it was full of lions.",Curious to dive deeper
501," Well that's cool. And they did that all for just a single voter too! Did you know that in the United Kingdom, not every man could vote until 1918, that's not a long time ago",Surprised
501,Wow i didn't know that. Also a shame that 34% of black males have been permanently unable to vote in Alabama.,Curious to dive deeper
501," I agree that is sad. What makes me laugh though, is that the citizens in Texas voted to rename a garbage dump in Austin to""Fred Durst""that's definitely a diss on him haha",Surprised
501,Yeah it is. You know there hasn't been a US president who wasn't a republican or Dem since the mid 1800's.,Curious to dive deeper
501," No I didn't know that. I think it would be interesting to have more political parties in the United States though. Another interesting thing, is that every president with a beard has been a republican, I wonder why that is haha",Surprised
501,Wow no republican has been elected with out a bush or Nixon on the ticket since 1928. That sounds oddly weird to me.,Curious to dive deeper
501," That is really weird. Although I think that information is old, because Trump was elected and he's a Republican. What is really crazy to me, is that the red and blue colors for Republicans Democrats only started in the year 2000. That seems like it's been that way my whole life, but apparently not",Surprised
501,Yeah you would think it's been a lot longer than that. At least to my relocation.,Curious to dive deeper
501," Yep I agree. Do you remember Harry Truman? He was president in 1957, and a Democrat, and so he wouldn't get his picture taken with Dumbo because Dumbos an elephant aka a republican lol",Surprised
501,How ridiculous! If didn't want a picture with dumbo so what how does at 60-70 years old. haha!,Curious to dive deeper
501,Haha I know right! does that mean that a republican shouldn't get a picture with Eeyore because eeyore is a donkey LOL I mean anything is possible now,Happy
501,Right! There have been 16 US republican President. Apparently that's the most from any one party.,Curious to dive deeper
501," That is interesting. Also interesting is the evolution of the two parties. it's even crazy that the Republican party started back in 1854, and before that they were known as the Whigs",Surprised
502,Did you know Richard Nixon cracked the us senate gavel after being used for 165 years?,Surprised
502," I was not aware of that, very interesting.  Are you really into politics?",Curious to dive deeper
502," just a little, i like to know whats going on",Curious to dive deeper
502,i live in Washington dc so its always on,Curious to dive deeper
502," i would not care for that, did you know astronauts vote from space?",Surprised
502,That is awesome.  I am glad that they have the opportunity.  Do you follow the republican party?,Curious to dive deeper
502," yes, every president with a beard has been a republican:)",Surprised
502," not sure how accurate that is, Trump does not have a beard",Surprised
502," just meant the ones that have had a beard, it seems like red and blue has been used forever for rep & dems but did you know it only started in 2000?",Surprised
502,I understand.  I thought the red and blue would have started earlier.  I feel like I have seen it forever.,Curious to dive deeper
502," same, also only dem or rep president since 1853, time for an independent?",Surprised
502," I agree with that, they have least funding though",Surprised
502," true, hows this for voting, Indian govt set up poll in a forest with lions",Surprised
502,that is crazy,Surprised
502," they had one voter, talk about restricting the votes",Surprised
502,Hardly feels like a majority.  Do you follow the Senate?,Surprised
502," not so much, i like the idea of the candy desk where they keep a drawer of candy for the senators though",Happy
502,I love that idea.  As well as women staging a protest for pants suits.,Curious to dive deeper
502," yes, hard to believe they could not wear pants until 1993!",Surprised
502,Craziness.  Are you registered to vote?,Curious to dive deeper
502," yes, i think it is important",Happy
502," Me too, a way to make change",Curious to dive deeper
502,nice chatting,Happy
502,Same to you.,Happy
502,:),Happy
503,How does America make collective decisions.  By voting.,Neutral
503,Do you know the difference between the United States Senate and House of Representatives?,Curious to dive deeper
503," One difference is 2 per state for the Senate while the House has 435 districts.  Those who are elected call the people who are represented ""constituents""",Neutral
503," Yes, and the Senate is considered more prestigious  and more deliberative. They're both important in for presidential votes, I think.",Curious to dive deeper
503,Yes.   The senate has certain rules where 60 votes are required for many bills.  I think that forces more deliberatioin.  They used the same gavel for 155 years until Richard Nixon cracked it.,Neutral
503,The only fun think I've learned about the Senate is that they started the candy desk tradition. I remember my teachers always had candy drawers in their desks.,Curious to dive deeper
503,I have one in my office too.  One needs supplements if your blood sugar drops for no good reason.  Apparently Pennsylvania is the source of the candy right now.,Neutral
503,Was that because of the Hershey factory there? Did you know they let astronauts vote from outer space? I think that's a good thing.,Curious to dive deeper
503," The astronaut voting sends a strong message about how important voting is.  I like that too.  For some reason, the candies are Mars bars and Milky Way rather than Hershey.",Neutral
503,I'd think they'd have expensive candies from local shops. I wonder why the Senate used to have a rule that women were not allowed to wear pants until after 1993?,Curious to dive deeper
503," I suspect that women set the dress code in years past so they would look professional. Michael Jordan would not endorse a democrat because ""republicans buy shoes too""",Neutral
503,I heard that about Jordan but I really didn't understand what he meant. I also don't understand why Republicans started out with ideals more like Democrats today and then switched.,Curious to dive deeper
503,Jordan has his own line of shoes made by Nike.  It is a separate brand and he does not want to offend almost half of the market.  But the GOP has always been small government and low regulations.,Neutral
503," I get it now! Well, Jordan was smart for that as far as business goes, it seems. It's also interesting to me how the Republicans are associated with red and Democrats with blue.",Curious to dive deeper
503,Yes.  I remember one election where one network had those colors reversed.  But the color code is solidly established now.,Neutral
503," It seems like it's been so since long before 2000, but that's the year it started, I guess. I think it's funny that Truman wouldn't be photographed on a Dumbo ride as to not be associated with Republicans.",Curious to dive deeper
503,That is amusing.  It is also odd that all Presidents with a beard have been republicans.,Neutral
503,Do you think a party besides Republican or Democrat will ever actually have a person elected as president like Independent or Green Party?,Curious to dive deeper
503," Ha Ha.  I think it is possible that one party will collapse because it is too narrow and a third party will become the second party.  It seems that the democrats are growing, particularly with immigration swelling their ranks, so the GOP is most likely to collapse.",Neutral
503," Even though I don't fully agree with either major party, it does make more sense if Republicans faded before democrats because they seem to have the most restrictions that keep things fair. Maybe Republican's numbers with the attitude of the strong survive is fading?",Curious to dive deeper
503," I understand.  However, I believe in free enterprise which has created the wealth of America.  I am not optimistic that dems will stay on that track.  Too many socialists.  Nice chatting.",Neutral
504,Do you read much poetry?,Curious to dive deeper
504,I do sometimes. What about you though? I do read a lot of old Epic tales like the Epic of Gilgamesh,Curious to dive deeper
504,I've never read that one. It sounds fascinating though. I read more classics like the Iliad.,Curious to dive deeper
504,Yes I read that too. They're very interesting I think. We should put more effort to read those kinds of books in our school system,Happy
504,I totally agree. Poetry and its word choices and writing structure makes it something that encourages creativity.,Neutral
504," Yes and the interesting thing about the word poetry is that it drives from a Greek term, the term is poesis which means making",Curious to dive deeper
504,That makes sense since when it comes to poetry you are definitely making something. I don't think it is as appreciated as a writing form as it could be.,Sad
504," Yes I agree. No one really writes poetry anymore. It's interesting how in Javanese, the alphabet will form a phone when it is read in order",Surprised
504,Oh that's really neat. I love when poems do cool things like that. Like the depressing poem that you are meant to read backwards so it becomes a happy one.,Happy
504," Yes I'll have to check that out. It makes me sad that Edgar Allan Poe only got $9 for the poem ""The Raven"" that's actually a really amazing poem",Surprised
504,You would think that his family estate is getting royalties on that. I bet the person that paid him so little was kicking themselves when he became popular.,Neutral
504," Yes I agree. Did you hear about the 224 palindrome poem? It was created by Demetri Martin, that sounds interesting",Curious to dive deeper
504,224! That is a huge amount of palindromes. I'm not even sure I can think of that many let alone that many sentences that could be palindromes. Talk about talent.,Surprised
504,Yes I agree! What do you think about the Sun by the way? It's amazing that the diameter is 109 times that of Earth's diameter that is so huge,Surprised
504,That is really huge! And to think it is still only 1 billionth of the size of the largest star ever seen in our galaxy. Makes you really feel small.,Surprised
504," Yes I agree. Also I never knew that the sun is actually white, only the atmosphere makes it seem yellow, I wonder why we don't learn at school",Surprised
504,You would think that would be something they would teach. I know that we covered the lightening bolt being hotter than the sun at some point. That is one of the random facts that sticks with you.,Curious to dive deeper
504,Yes that is a surprising fact. Planets are so interesting though. I never knew that Venus didn't tilt and that it also doesn't have any seasons,Surprised
504,I did not know that. That is way different that uranus which roles because of how much it tilts.,Surprised
504,The name Uranus always makes me laugh haha. I wish that we had another planet in our solar system no. Jupiter's moon Ganymede could actually be considered a planet if it orbited the Sun instead of being a moon,Surprised
504,I miss pluto being considered a planet. It is hard to remember them because we can't use the first letter memory trick anymore.,Sad
505,Do you know much about the US senate?,Curious to dive deeper
505," A little, I know people are up in arms over Kavanaugh's Supremo Court nomination. ",Curious to dive deeper
505,Yes very much so. That was quite the rough battle. Did you know that they had the same gavel for 165 years?,Curious to dive deeper
505,I heard that and then old Trick Dick broke it.,Curious to dive deeper
505,Yes he did. Were you also aware that there is a candy desk in the senate?,Curious to dive deeper
505,Sounds about right is there anything good any it?,Curious to dive deeper
505," Yes, it's supplied with candy from Pennsylvania including milky ways, mars bars, and jelly beans. ",Neutral
505,Well i guess sometimes you need a snack. Did you know that women until recently could not wear pants on the Senate floor?,Curious to dive deeper
505,That's very upsetting. Do you know how recently?,Curious to dive deeper
505,It wasn't until 1993 and two women had to be defiant to get their point across.,Curious to dive deeper
505,What?! That's far too recent. I didn't realize sexism quite that blatant was so recent. Very upsetting.,Angry
505,Yes it is. In India the government set the polling booths in the forest full of lions.,Curious to dive deeper
505,That's extremely accommodating. I knew that astronauts can vote from space which is also impressive.,Surprised
505," Especially when there are so many people who would like to vote but can't, like 34% of black men in Alabama. ",Curious to dive deeper
505,That's absolutely horrible and unacceptable. There seems to be a decent amount of suppression going around.,Angry
505," Yeah and it's all unfortunate. Wow apparently Austin Texas doesn't like Fred Durst much. They wanted to name a garbage dump after him,lol.",Curious to dive deeper
505,Ha ha! That's hilarious! I wonder if they let them.,Curious to dive deeper
505,No president that was a republican did not have a beard. Sounds funny must be including trump.,Curious to dive deeper
505,That's very interesting. How odd. I do know that with the exception of Trump the last time a republican was elected president with no Bush or Nixon on the ticket was 1928!,Surprised
505,Strange...I didn't know that Mormons were mostly republicans. There have been a total of 19 republican presidents.,Curious to dive deeper
505,I did not know that either. I wonder how many have been Democrats for comparison?,Curious to dive deeper
506,Do you happen to own an iPhone?,Curious to dive deeper
506,I do.  I dont think Ill ever switch to a Microsoft or any other device,Curious to dive deeper
506,I have one as well. Did you know that women are more likely than men to have an iPhone? I wonder why.,Curious to dive deeper
506," Im not sure, they probably werent the ones downloading that game send me to heaven and launching them into the air.",Curious to dive deeper
506,Ha ha maybe. Have you heard of the band Muse?,Curious to dive deeper
506," Cant say that I have, what do they do?",Curious to dive deeper
506,Kind of pop rock. Matt Bellamy of Muse recorded his unborn son's heartbeat with his iPhone and used it on a song recording.,Neutral
506," That is pretty neat.  It is certainly a huge part of our society today, I am glad it has developed from the first versions where Jobs had to switch it out because it kept crashing.",Curious to dive deeper
506,That's so embarrassing. I hope he pulled it off. Microsoft held an iPhone funeral when they released their phones. That was presumptuous.,Surprised
506," Very much so, I bet apple just laughed.  Apple's electronics are far superior, in my opinion.  Their clothing line from 1986, likely not.",Curious to dive deeper
506," Wow! I don't remember that venture. That was a bad idea. Speaking of clothing, did you know that the pilgrims were colorful clothing?",Curious to dive deeper
506," I had heard that, but I guess i just remember the white and black from all the history books, or rather the illustrations and descriptions.  ",Surprised
506,They always depicted it that way but they only wore black for special occasions.,Curious to dive deeper
506," I wonder why they always were depicted like that, I mean color is so much more fun.",Curious to dive deeper
506,That's a very good question. There is a store in Alabama that only sells clothing and items found in unclaimed baggage.,Neutral
506,It must be like a high end thrift shop.  I often wondered what happened to all of those clothes.,Neutral
506,I think it would be interesting to visit. This is off topic but do you know much about the white house?,Curious to dive deeper
506," I know some odds and ends, like they still use floppy disks for storing files.  I didnt even know they made floppy disks anymore.",Surprised
506,I didn't either. I have not seen one of those in forever. Did you know that the white house has twin buildings in Ireland and France? I wonder why they decided to do that?,Curious to dive deeper
506," It also seems like twin buildings could pose a security threat, unless those are equally secure.",Curious to dive deeper
506,I agree but i am unaware of whether they are there for aesthetics or function.,Curious to dive deeper
507," Hi, how are you? What do you know about the White House?",Neutral
507,I know that there are identical versions of it in Ireland and France,Neutral
507,That makes sense. The US has had close relationships with those countries for years.,Neutral
507,Their versions probably don't still use floppy disks for storing like ours does partially,Neutral
507,I wonder if that is for security purposes. Strangely outdated tech. Hm.,Neutral
507," That was my guess too. I find it interesting how many times the White House has undergone renovations. The West Wing wasn't created until 1901, and it was expanded only eight years after that",Neutral
507," It was a modest residence. The guest house is bigger, I hear. I wonder when that was built.",Neutral
507," Who knows? I'm surprised Trump hasn't made any changes to the White House. Solar panels were put on the back by George W. Bush, and I've heard that's not the first time they've attempted solar power",Surprised
507,Carter put them on first. Oil shock and that. Reagan removed them. Clinton did nothing.,Neutral
507,At least none of them banned Christmas trees like Teddy Roosevelt did,Neutral
507,Teddy was a conservationist. He did like destroying nature. Unless they were animals with heads for trophies.,Neutral
507,Think he made clothing from fur? I wouldn't be surprised if he did,Curious to dive deeper
507,He probably did. I guess he thought he was being manly by killing wild animals. Seems senseless. There are other ways to prove your toughness.,Neutral
507," True, though I'm sure it was good insulation in the winter",Neutral
507," Yes, that's true. He was an interesting guy. Larger than life.",Neutral
507," I wonder if he would have had an iPhone if he lived in this decade. Women are more likely to own them than men, but maybe he would have preferred Apple",Curious to dive deeper
507,I think he would have hated technology like that. He was an outdoorsman.,Neutral
507," He might have tried the game ""Send me to heaven"" by throwing his into the air. He wouldn't have minded a shattered phone if he won",Neutral
507," LOL. Probably not. Anyway, thanks for the chat!",Neutral
507," He definitely wouldn't have bought anything from Apple's clothing line. Yes, good chat!",Neutral
507,True. Apple clothing? LOL,Neutral
507,It was a thing back in the 80s. It likely died in the 80s as well,Neutral
508,hi how are you today? what do you think of shoes?,Neutral
508,I think shoes are very valuable.,Happy
508,Can you relax with your shoes? John Candy couldn't. he had to take them off. boy his dogs were barking! I usually wear shoes myself.,Neutral
508,I probably wear my boots more than shoes.,Happy
508,do you wear your boots to bed? i had a friend who did that. he was worried that someone would break into his house and he would have to fight them. he didnt want bare feet.,Neutral
508,I usually dont wear them to bed. Unless I am really tired and just pass out.,Happy
508,i guess i would wear my shoes to bed if i lived in a bad neighborhood and had to fight burglars or raccoons.,Neutral
508,That kind of sounds a little bit insane to me to ber honest.,Happy
508," yes, but in bad neighborhoods sometimes people break into your place and you might need to confront them. you want your shoes on then. clothing would be good too.",Neutral
508,Yeah I guess your right. did you know there are 17 ways to tie your shoes.,Happy
508," i wonder which one is best for fighting burglars and raccoons and other vermin. i think that it should be a practical knot that can be tied quickly, just before combat.",Neutral
508,I think as long a it keeps your shoe on your foot and is quickto tie it would be best.,Happy
508," yes, burglars can be pretty quick, so you need to ""stay on your toes"" when it comes to tying your shoes. ",Neutral
508,That certainly is true.,Happy
508," i knew that you would agree. i have made a rational case for ""bed shoes"" to go with my bed clothes. dont ever worry about burglars again. you have your bed shoes and a knot in the laces that will stay tied in a fight.",Neutral
508,You could just use velcro,Happy
508," velcro *is* speedy, ill grant you that one. but will it hold, especially in the heat of domestic combat? that is for someone else to test in the field, not me, oh boy, i made that mistake before. ",Neutral
508,Lol. Well be sure to get your idea patented like Bill nye did.,Happy
508,Bill Nye. now that man could tie a shoe. he is a scientist. he know how to make things stick.,Neutral
508,I know right. He patented som ballet slippers. I think he could do better.,Happy
508," never misunderestimate good old Bill. anyway, great chat. i gotta go change muh shoes.",Neutral
508,bye bye,Happy
509,Hello,Happy
509,Hey. Did you ever get jealous of the kinds of clothes your friends had when you were a kid?,Curious to dive deeper
509," I totally did!  They were just bragging today about ""shoes""  apparently they go on feet to comfort and protect them.  Bunch of snobs, I think.",Happy
509," I remember wanting the trendier clothes my friends wore, and once or twice getting made fun of for wearing hand me downs.",Curious to dive deeper
509,I hear ya there.  One of my friends is wanting to do a clothing line for fish.  I keep telling her that fresh water fish drink through their skin via osmosis.,Happy
509," That sounds more complicated than my aunt buying clothes for her dog! Some fish drink water via their mouths, but the ones that soak it in through their skin would need clothes that wouldn't block that.",Surprised
509,This is so true.  I think that's why I like Jack Purcell canvas shoes.  The dog never gets them dirty when we go for a walk.,Happy
509," I wonder if dogs ever get ""jealous"" of other dogs with clothes. Can dogs even make fun of each other like kids or adults sometimes do?",Curious to dive deeper
509," I'm sure they do.  If crows understand economics, trade and barter, then dogs pretty much have to understand jealousy.",Happy
509,Hopefully that won't lead to anything like the coat ban in some schools to try to stop kids from teasing others for their clothing quality. Can you imagine being banned from the dog park because your dog's Jack Purcells are too nice?,Curious to dive deeper
509," You have a good point, but my dog only wears Patagonia, so I'm not too worried.",Happy
509," I didn't know Patagonia made dog clothes too! They have really nice human coats (that's funny to write), and they're usually less expensive than some designer brands. Some of those get up to $955 or more!",Surprised
509,I know!  Moncler coats cost more than my first car did.,Happy
509," I don't think I've ever spent more than $40 on a coat, but I have a hard time not being cheap about clothes, plus I live in the desert where I don't need them much! I've never bought anything like a Moncler.",Surprised
509,Poverty Shaming seems like it would take so much energy.   You always have to try and be original or it just starts to turn into a meme,Happy
509," It's really sad how petty or troubled of a person you have to be to do it too. People put down others because they haven't learned to pick themselves up any other way, and it's indicative of deeper problems.",Sad
509,Oh totally!  They would be better off spending their time buying clothes for their dog.,Happy
509,Maybe people should be more like dogs sometimes. Dogs aren't going to make fun of other dogs for not having smartphones or nice coats like people do.,Neutral
509," You do make a really valid point, but dogs also eat burritos off the ground, so it's a trade off really.",Happy
509," On the other hand, dogs don't waste food that way! It's a money-saving method that I don't know if I have the stomach to adopt.",Happy
509," Alright, you're right!  Dogs should be more like people!",Happy
510," hello,  do you vote?  did you know Indian government puts their polling booth in a forst full of lions?  That is crazy!!",Curious to dive deeper
510," That sure is crazy and yes, I do vote. DO you? Astronauts are so cool, they vote from space",Curious to dive deeper
510,Every vote counts lol,Curious to dive deeper
510,It sure does. In the UK not all men were able to vote until 1918,Curious to dive deeper
510,Thats weird.  I wonder why that was.  Did you know the us sante used the same gavel for 165 years!,Curious to dive deeper
510,Yeah until Nixon broke it. I wonder if they were mad at him for that,Curious to dive deeper
510," haha,  maybe he just had to pay for a new gavel. ",Curious to dive deeper
510,Maybe. In Alabama sadly a large portion of the male balck population cannot vote,Curious to dive deeper
510," Wow,  permanently too.  I wonder if thats due to people in jail?  Maybe?",Curious to dive deeper
510,I think that is what it is. On the other hand in Texas seems people are more interested in voting to change the name of the garbage dump,Curious to dive deeper
510," That seems so dumb to me,  are there not more important things to vote on?  Also,  that is so negative towards that person,  arent we voting to make things better,  for positve outcomes.  ",Curious to dive deeper
510,Yeah go figure. In Senate women were not allowed to wear pants until lately,Curious to dive deeper
510,Yikes they must have been cold!  I wonder why the topic of women wearing pants is such a big deal in that time.,Curious to dive deeper
510," Well, it is about equality and they must have opposed it until those two senators decided to protest by wearing pants. Good for them",Curious to dive deeper
510," Heres a fun fact,  Every us pres who had a beard was republican lol ",Curious to dive deeper
510,Cool. And we have either had a republican and democrat president since 1853,Curious to dive deeper
510,Yeah thats interesting!  Looks like Truman refused to take a pic with Dumbo when he was at Disneyland so it wouldnt be associated with republicans.  Why does dumbo related to republicans?  do you know?,Curious to dive deeper
510,Yeah the Republican logo is an elephant and Dumbo is a baby elephant so I guess he did not want to be associated with that,Curious to dive deeper
510,Oh wow lol But its just Disneyland lol,Curious to dive deeper
510,I know right? Go figure. Did you know both parties adopted the blue and red as late as 2000,Curious to dive deeper
510," Yeah,   i thought that had been around forever lol I guess not.  Have a good one! ",Neutral
511," Do you take much interest in the first lady, now or in the past?",Curious to dive deeper
511," Some, I always try to pay attention to whats going on in the world.",Neutral
511," I always feel that the first lady is in position by chance, not act.  I know people like to know what they are wearing and stuff, but it seems trivial to me.",Neutral
511," Very true, but no matter what they must conduct themselves with dignity, and their past all of a sudden becomes more in the public eye.  I never care who/what/where people wear.  Id rather see their actions.",Neutral
511," The first lady is damned if they do and damned if they don't, get involved in policy that is.",Sad
511," It is sadly true.  Supposedly Melania wore a Jacket saying ""I dont care.  Do U"" to the boarder separated children",Neutral
511," Probably not the best choice, but I'd hate it if every choice I made was monitored by hundreds of people every day.",Sad
511," Very true, It is hard to make any statement without a certain base of people hating on it.",Neutral
511,The thing now that everyone has iphones and can take pictures of you every second of the day.,Sad
511," That does make things so much harder.  In the past, you might have to worry about some secret cameras, but mainly only got photographed  at big events.  Now it can be at the store.",Neutral
511," The only place they can escape the constant media is in the White House, or any other private residence they may have.",Neutral
511,Very true.  If they did sneak photos they might catch her using floppy disks.  The white house still uses thos for storage,Neutral
511," That would be scandal, they'd accuse her of being a technophobe. In the days of iphones I thought floppy disks would be non existent.",Surprised
511,It really would.  A laughable one at that.,Neutral
511," At least they are advanced enough to have solar panels on the building, Bush put them back after Reagan took them off.",Happy
511," I heard that, I wonder why Reagan took them off.  Solar is such a great benefit!",Neutral
511,Probably making a political point.  usually everything Presidents do is to make a point.  Can't see any other reason.  Unless the reflection was getting in his eyes.,Sad
511," True, It was like good old Teddy banning Christmas trees, because he was a conservationist!",Neutral
511," It makes sense if that is your belief.  Can you imagine the uproar now if a President did it today, the media would be full of their assault on Christmas and Christianity.",Sad
511," It would, unfortunately.  People just read into a situation only what they want to see.",Neutral
511," Well I need to go and get some clothing on, have a good day.",Neutral
511,Same here.  You as well!,Neutral
512,Hello! Are you into politics at all?,Neutral
512," Hi,kind of how about you?",Neutral
512," Same here, but only recently. Did you know astronauts can vote from space?",Surprised
512," I didn't know, that' cool. I know that a chimpanzee received 400,000 votes in Rio de Janeiro in 1988. ",Neutral
512,Haha He would have my vote too! I didn't know not all men in the uk could vote until 1918!,Surprised
512,haha mine too. Do you that all votes in Canada are equal to all the votes in California minus 50 votes.,Neutral
512,I believe it! I wonder what Canadian politics is like. I wonder if they used the same gavel as long as the US senate did?,Surprised
512,I'm not sure.do yo know that JFK voted against the 1957 civil rights act.,Neutral
512," And he was a democrat wasn't he? Crazy! He didn't have a beard so he had to be, since every president with a beard were Republicans!",Surprised
512," not necessarily, at some point Hilary Clinton was the president of young republication in college. I wonder what made her change her political party. ",Neutral
512," Very interesting! Harry Truman was so anti republican that even at disneyland, he refused to be pictured on Dumbo!",Happy
512,interesting. He was selected to be the vice president under Roosevelt because he was able to expose corruption and he saved the government $10-$15  billion when he ran the senate Truman committee.,Neutral
512,That's one way to get into the office! I didn't know we only associated colors with the parties as late as 2000!,Surprised
512,Really? I didn't know either. but yeah some did a really great job like Strom Thurmond. he holds the record for the longest filibuster by a lone senator because stayed on the senate floor speaking for more than 24 hours non stop.,Neutral
512,I remember hearing about that! I would have been sitting at the candy desk during that one!,Surprised
512," Haha that's funny, in 2000 40% of Alabamas voted to keep a ban on interracial marriages. what did you think about that?",Happy
512,I think they all need to lose their right to vote! I think it's funny that Austin TX citizens voted to rename their dump Fred Durst.,Surprised
512," Fred Durst, the singer? that's kind of weird. ",Surprised
512,Yes probably because they think his music was garbage lol. Voting is just a cool thing people do. India even set up a polling station in the jungle for a single voter.,Happy
512,haha that's kind of funny and I feel bad for that voter.,Surprised
512," He or she had a fun time finding it I'm sure. Well it was great chatting, have a good night!",Curious to dive deeper
512," thank you, you do the same",Neutral
512,Thanks!,Curious to dive deeper
513,Hello!  Do you like fish?,Happy
513,I do like fish. Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
513," I've always like them since I was a kid.  Did you know that freshwater fish only ""drink"" water through their skin via Osmosis?",Happy
513,I had no idea. How do salt water fish do it then?,Curious to dive deeper
513,They ironically drink through their mouths.  Weird.,Happy
513,Yeah. The black swallower fish seems legit. And also has a big stomach!,Surprised
513,That must be why it can eat prey twice it's own weight and 10 times it's weight?,Happy
513,10 times its weight is crazy! I weigh 245 and cannot imagine eating something that weighs 2450 pounds!,Surprised
513,LOL  Did you know that the seahorse is the only fish to not have a neck?,Happy
513,No but I do rememebr seeing a cartoon with Aquaman using the seahorse like a regular horse and it made me happy and laugh!,Happy
513,That's right! lol  There is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.  That's kind of neat.,Happy
513,I would like to know his secret! Maybe not immortal but give me until 125...,Happy
513,I hear you there!  I hear people say they don't want to live long all the time.  I'm the opposite.  I would love to live to a long time.  There must be some immortality in shoes as they say 5000 year old shoes perfom better than modern shoes.,Happy
513,That's some old shoes! I will get a pension in a few years and I want to live a long time to build wealth!,Happy
513,lol Speaking of shoes.  My feet stink really bad and they make my shoes smelly.  Do you know how I can get rid of the smell in my stinky shoes?  lol,Curious to dive deeper
513,HAHAHA... A really self-depricating transition but I appreciate the work! Either tea bags of trash can...,Happy
513,Nice!  I will have to try that before I get a rash or something. hahaha  Did you know that professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week?,Happy
513,I wonder how much ballet shoes are? That seems really expensive.,Surprised
513,I'm not sure.  But that's what I was thinking as well.  They must get paid pretty good or the ballet companies must buy them.,Happy
513,Are there shoe contract in ballet like in basketball?,Curious to dive deeper
513,I'm not sure.  Be curious to find out.  I have to get going.  It's been a pleasure chatting with you!  Hope you have a good day.  I have smelly shoes to take care of!  LOL,Happy
514," Hello, my good friend! How are you doing today on this fine fine day?",Neutral
514,Hi very good thanks. It is interesting learning about the Republican party back in the 1800's!,Curious to dive deeper
514," The Republican party has deep roots, it has a long history, but it has changed. Now we are down to just two parties. It is not good.",Neutral
514,Yeah I agree. Since 1853 there has been no president other than republican or democrats.,Neutral
514,I think that the red/blue division has made politics unsatisfying for many voters. They want other options but there are none.,Neutral
514,True. That whole categorization didn't start until 2000 surprisingly.,Surprised
514,I think that the polarization of politics came with the Bush/Gore election. I am not happy that it has not changed. Now we need for independents.,Neutral
514,Yes I agree with you there. Interestingly every president with a beard has been a republican!,Surprised
514," I think that the beard conveys wisdom, the deep wisdom that comes from age. I think that the republicans want to look like Lincoln.",Neutral
514,Yes good point. In the pas they used animals to associate with parties. Truman took that very seriously.,Curious to dive deeper
514,I think that Truman knew that the elephant was his mortal enemy and could not be trusted. Even at Disneyland. He knew the impact of media.,Neutral
514,True. He just didn't want to be associated with Republicans!,Neutral
514," I think that he was smart. The Republicans were probably trying to set him up. They laid a cunning trap, but he was too smart for those ",Neutral
514,Yeah Truman was a smart guy like you say. After the Voting Rights Act in 1965 the southern states became more reupublican.,Surprised
514," Yes, the voting issue made many people in the South angry. They did not want the change so they went to the other party, the one with the beards.",Neutral
514,Haha the beard party yes. Interesting that the GOP used to endorse values of classical liberalism.,Surprised
514," That is the odd thing about the name. It is liberalism from Europe, not the liberalism of the socialists. I do not understand politics. The confusion seems intentional.",Neutral
514,Yes it would be so nice if there were simpler terms. The Senate also confuses me. It is the more prestigious body than the House of Representatives.,Curious to dive deeper
514,There are fewer Senators and they have 6 year terms. They are special in politics.,Neutral
514,Interesting. The presiding officer of the Senate is the Vice President!,Surprised
514," Yes, the VP has power to cast a deciding vote if there is a tie. ",Neutral
514,Wow so much power. The senate once used the same gavel for 165 years!,Surprised
515,do you like jazz music?,Curious to dive deeper
515,I sure do. Did you know CLint Eastwood is also a huge fan?,Curious to dive deeper
515,Yes and he also loves the piano too,Curious to dive deeper
515,Yes. A woman in harlem hosts free concerts in her apartment every day,Curious to dive deeper
515,Yes for 20 years now and many people stop by there,Curious to dive deeper
515,Yeah. Do you know who has the best jazz orchestra in the world?,Curious to dive deeper
515," Yes that is Pakistan, strange a bit but good for them",Curious to dive deeper
515,I know. Do you know why trumpeters have a goatee?,Curious to dive deeper
515,Yes because it is more comfortable when they play,Curious to dive deeper
515,Yes. Do you like Pixar?,Curious to dive deeper
515," I sure do, they also have a room where only celebrities are allowed in",Curious to dive deeper
515,Yeah. Did you know RObin Williams was the voice of Aladdin?,Curious to dive deeper
515,Yes and he started that trend of celebrities doing voices,Curious to dive deeper
515,Yeah. Did you know LeBron is the only one that makes more than JUdge Judy?,Curious to dive deeper
515,Yeah. Carol Burnett was the first celebrity on Sesame Street,Curious to dive deeper
515,Yeah. Did you know Texas elected their first female governor when some others statements had not even ratified the amendment?,Curious to dive deeper
515,Yeah. DO you know the songs Come Together by the Beatles?,Curious to dive deeper
515,Yes it was written for a California Governor's campaign in 1969.,Curious to dive deeper
515,Yeah. Do you know where Schwarzenegger lived when he was governor?,Curious to dive deeper
515," Not in Sacramento, he travelled everyday there though",Curious to dive deeper
515,Yes and he used a private jet every day,Curious to dive deeper
516,Did you listen to Led Zeppelin?  There's a new book out about them.,Curious to dive deeper
516,I was not aware of that. Have you heard it?,Curious to dive deeper
516,It's a book.  They do have many good albums.  I remember Houses of the Holy the most.,Curious to dive deeper
516," I know they were hugely popular. They were a bit before my time. I do kind of like ""stairway to Heaven"".",Neutral
516,That song got sooooo much airplay and some their best didn't.  This last book actually is actually from the remaining 3 members.,Surprised
516,I enjoy books like that. It is interesting to get insight into great bands.,Curious to dive deeper

516,Very cool. Have you ever tried to play the guitar?,Curious to dive deeper
516,I tried but I wanted to play well immediately and it made my finders hurt.  I'm no Jimmy Page...,Neutral
516,I tried to learn many years ago. I just didn't have the patience. My daughter has taught herself the ukulele.,Neutral
516,No patience here either... The guitarist from Queen uses coins for pick. Maybe that would have helped...,Surprised
516," Have you seen ""Bohemian Rhapsody""? I think it would be interesting.",Curious to dive deeper
516," No, but I used to be a Queen listener.  I don't know much about Linkin Park but they have the best selling album of the 21st century call ""Hybrid Theory."" ",Surprised
516," Growing up I was a little indifferent to Queen, but now I really like a lot of their stuff. Which band do you think is beater, Queen or Led Zeppelin?",Curious to dive deeper
516," Different styles but I'd go with Led Zeppelin since they were more prolific. They named the song ""Black Dog"" after a dog that hung around the studio.",Curious to dive deeper
516," Yeah, That is interesting. I guess naming a song can be a challenge.",Neutral
516," Naming software is the same way... I'm surprised that Led Zeppelin helped fund Monty Python's ""The Holy Grail""... Classic...",Surprised
516," That is also interesting. Have you seen ""The Holy Grail"" lately?",Curious to dive deeper
516," It's been a while... I've seen it many times.  Funny, two identical twins in Japan released a rap album when they turned 100 in 1992!",Surprised
516,I prefer to watch that in scenes because the whole movie is a bit boring. Could you imagine raping when you are 100?,Curious to dive deeper
516," I can't imagine breathing when I'm 100. Thanks, you were a great chat partner!",Happy
517," Hello,  how are you doing?  Did you know There is a programming language in which the programs are written in musical composition, and functional programs have jazz-like harmonies.",Surprised
517,That's interesting. I guess there is a reason some jazz trumpeters have goatees. It provides comfort when playing.,Surprised

517," Speaking of celebrities, Pixar has a secret room that is often visited by celebrities. I wonder what is in it.",Curious to dive deeper

517," Thats interesting.  Judge judy makes $123,000 per episode, making her the highest paid celebrity only after lebron james.",Neutral
517,Some celebrities try to do noble things with their fame. Ethiopia has a tv chef that thinks he can combat the country's hunger,Surprised

517,It was for Timothy Leary's 1969 California governor campaign.,Neutral
517,Good to know! Ralph lawrence carr was the only governor to oppose the internment of japanese americans during ww2,Surprised
517,That is kind of depressing!,Sad
517," I know right. Texas elected their first female governor, the second in the nation, before some states even ratified the 19th amendment.",Surprised
517," Well, that is kind of encouraging. Did you know that in 1934 North Dakota seceded from the US because North Dakota's governor declared martial law?",Surprised
517," Interesting. When schwarzenegger was governor of california, he never lived in sacramento. instead he commuted 3 hours everyday... by private jet.",Surprised
517,I wonder whose dime that was on.,Curious to dive deeper
517,Good question!,Neutral

517,yeah I know right.  Good talking to you.,Neutral

518," Yes, it originated there in the late 19th century. ",Neutral
518," There's all kinds of jazz, there's swing jazz, gypsy jazz, bluesy jazz, ragtime and European military band music.",Curious to dive deeper
518,Jazz was often played at faster tempos and used more chord-based imprvisation.,Neutral
518," Uh-huh. True.  New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation.  In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands were the prominent style.",Curious to dive deeper
518," But by the end of the 1940s, cool jazz developed.",Neutral

518," I wonder who visited it, I want to know what inside now.",Neutral
518,Me too.  Did you know that Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on Sesame Street?  Isn't that cute?,Curious to dive deeper
518," Thats interesting! Speaking of other actors, Robin Williams in Aladdin was the first actor to star the trend of celebrities being voice actors.",Neutral

518,There were top performers stopping by sometimes even!,Neutral
518," Yes, and even more interesting is that there's a programming language where programs are written in musical composition and function with jazz-like harmonies.",Curious to dive deeper
518,That's very nice to know! Great chatting with you!,Happy
519,Do you like jazz ?,Curious to dive deeper
519," Hello there, I sure do, it's such an expressive form of music.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper

519," Yeah I would definitely say that it would be jazz!  I really like that style myself, how about you?  Have you ever visited New Orleans?",Curious to dive deeper
519," No never, is it worth it ? It seems that every city has its style of jazz even Kansas City.  ",Neutral
519," That is very true, Kansas city jazz is much more hard-swinging and bluesy, so cool how different regions have different styles. ",Curious to dive deeper
519,Do you think gypsies have anything to do with Gypsy Jazz ? I have never heard of any gypsies communities on US soil.,Neutral
519," I am not sure, that sounds more like an eastern european type jazz with the musette waltzes, very interesting though. ",Curious to dive deeper
519," But I a more interested in ""challenging"" jazz styles, the less ""dance-able"" the better it is for me. ",Neutral
519," Interesting, did you know that Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is super popular?",Curious to dive deeper
519," Yes, I have heard of it,  if jazz is new to them, they have 100 years of jazz music to play to their audience. ",Neutral
519," That is true, there also is a women in Harlem who has been hosting free jazz concerts at her apartment every Sunday for 20 years, wonder how her neighbors all feel about it?",Curious to dive deeper
519," Yeah, and it is a weekly think, I tolerate a party once or twice per year, but every week, I would start to complain. And you what do you think about this ?",Curious to dive deeper
519," I think that they all must really like jazz and like her, because 20 years of every sunday is a crazy amount of jazz concerts to hold!",Curious to dive deeper
519," It must be on the lease of the neighbors, ""must love jazz"". And ""not be afraid of people with goatee"". ",Neutral
519," Lol, good call!  Yeah I was very surprised to read that those goatees started as a functional thing, not just looking cool. ",Curious to dive deeper
519," I wonder how they found this, was it a guy who had already a goatee and did not complain or a guy that complained a lot and grew a goatee in last resort. ",Curious to dive deeper
519," Lol, hey that's like the chicken and the egg thing.  Anyways, it's been fun talking with you, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day!",Happy

520," Talented guy, what are your thoughts on the goatees some of the pleyers grow?",Curious to dive deeper
520,I like them. kinda sets them apart from other musicians. 1970's was the era for jazz.,Curious to dive deeper
520," It surely does, its characteristic of the genre, apparently they grow them for comfort",Curious to dive deeper
520,I could see that. Especially with a sax leaning on your chin all the time!,Surprised
520," Yeah, the hairs can reduce the frictioin and help them, Pakistan has a great jazz orchestra maybe they all have goatees",Curious to dive deeper
520,wouldn't that be something to see! Have you ever met a celeb?,Surprised
520," Only soccer players other than that no, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
520,I saw Bill clinton from a distance once. I also swear I saw tiger woods one time too! Pixar studios has a secret room just for celebs.,Curious to dive deeper
520," That room must be awesome, I wonder who has access to that room, maybe Robin Williams did",Curious to dive deeper
520,Maybe Judge Judy?,Surprised
520," She is one of the highest paid celebrities so yeah, that would makes sense, ",Curious to dive deeper
520,I wonder if Carol Burnett ever got to see it?,Surprised

521," I didn't know that! That's awesome though! Do you know how ""Black dog"" got its name for a song?",Curious to dive deeper
521," It appears there was a dog wandering around the studio! Interesting, I never knew that! Speaking of recording songs, NWAs straight outta compton was the first album to reach platinum status without a major tour.",Happy
521,That is so cool. That means it was really good haha. Did you know Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory is the best-selling album of the 21st century?,Curious to dive deeper
521,That's actually pretty surprising! Two twins in Japan released a rap album when they turned 100. It's never too late I guess.,Happy
521," Well said! I would love to hear it sometime haha. The Dark Side of the Moon was still one of the top albums in 2014, 40 years after release!",Curious to dive deeper
521,That's pretty awesome! Reel big fish had to rerecord all their hits for a best of album after losing the rights to their old record label. Ouch.,Happy

521,He looks smart haha. He uses coins as guitar picks too. That must take talent!,Curious to dive deeper
521," Yeah, he's a pretty interesting guy. Pink Floyd turned a house boat into a floating recording studio! ",Happy

522," No I did not.  But I am a huge Disney fan.  Did you know that ""The Lion King"" was the first Disney film dubbed into ZULU.  That was for it's African release.",Neutral
522," Really? No, I didn't know about that. Did you know that Wreck-It-Ralph was took three decades to create?",Surprised
522," Really, no, I did not know that.  That is crazy.  I did know that Frozen was directed by a women.  It was the first animated Disney film to do so.",Surprised
522,That is awesome! Hopefully she didn't use any recycled frames from other Disney movies.,Happy
522," I was glad to hear that.  Also, the toy industry gets involved very early with Disney movies.  Usually before the film even begins production.",Surprised
522,I bet. Did you hear about Mrs. Lambert? She passed away a few years ago.,Sad
522," No, I did not here about that.  But I am a huge animal fan.  Did you know that dogs can have 1 of 12 different blood types?",Surprised
522," Yeah, I did. I also heard that there are actually dog blood drives.",Happy
522," I heard that also.  That is great.  Dogs can see color, just not as many as humans can.  A lot of people think they are color blind but are not.",Surprised
522,That's good. Dogs are pretty amazing. I especially love how they are attuned to human behavior.,Happy
522,I wish the US was like Istanbul.  They have a vending machine for dogs that will release food and water for the strays in the city in exchange for recycled plastic bottles.,Happy
522," That would be great. Maybe since Google is a dog company, they'll start something like that. ",Happy
522,I am more of a cat person.  I have 5 indoor cats.  I remember reading that Google actually says in there code of conduct that they are a dog company.,Neutral
522,I don't really like cats.,Neutral
522," We are DONE talking, lol.  Speaking of hockey, Canada scored 132 goals and only let in 3 during the entire 1924 winter olympic games.  That was the first Winter Olympics by the way.",Curious to dive deeper
522,Lol. Did you know that an ice hockey rink can be found under basketball courts. They just leave it there when stadium sports change.,Curious to dive deeper
522," Yes, I did now that.  Honestly, my wife and I were talking about that last night.  She didn't know that.  Also, baseball may be American's national sport, but Canada is the only country with two, Lacrosse and Ice Hockey.",Neutral
522," Maybe I should start playing hockey. If I became a professional, I could lose up to 8 pounds in a single game.",Happy
522," May, I need to play that also.  A hockey player that went on to win 4 Stanley cups was traded in 1993 for $1.  That is crazy.  Someone is kicking themselves.",Curious to dive deeper
522," They have to be. I have to go, great chatting with you. ",Happy
522,Same to you.  Happy New Year.,Neutral
523,did you know that a hockey player can lose up to eight pounds over the course of one game,Surprised
523," Hi! No I didn't know that, are you a hockey fan?",Curious to dive deeper
523," kind of, I'm watching the superbowl right now though haha, I guess Canada's national sports are both hockey and lacrosse, I would have thought it was just hockey",Curious to dive deeper
523," Ahah 100%, and that is weird yeah I would've thought it's just hockey by far. It's obviously much bigger in Canada than here though. I know the U.S. Olympic Women's team lost to a New England high school team once.",Surprised
523," ya Canada is really good, I guess one year at the Olympics they scored 132 goals and only let in 3!",Surprised
523,God I can't imagine the other team's disappointment. That must be how Bulgaria felt when their women's team lost to Slovakia 82-0.,Neutral
523," that is crazy, are you a dog or a cat person?",Curious to dive deeper
523," I'm definitely more of a dog person, and yourself?",Curious to dive deeper
523," yes I like dogs a lot more, did you know that Google is officially a pro-dog company? haha",Happy
523," Wow, I wonder how they even chose that! Although it makes sense, dogs are intelligent, they can actually learn over 1000 words!",Surprised
523," wow that is wild, did you know that dogs have over 12 different blood types?",Surprised
523," Definitely more complex than humans all of a sudden. They can also be just like us though, some dogs have even learnt how to use the subway.",Surprised
523," ya they're so smart, also I always thought that dogs were colorblind, but they actually just can't see as many colors as a person can",Surprised
523," That's interesting, dogs are certainly more than we give credit to. Dogs even have eureka moments, just like we do!",Surprised
523," that is crazy! also, only dogs and elephants respond and understand pointing, no other animals do!",Surprised
523," Haha I guess elephants are intelligent too! On another note, are you a Disney movie fan?",Curious to dive deeper
523," yes I am, one of my favorite movies is Dumbo, speaking of elephants haha",Curious to dive deeper
523," Right on cue haha. Disney values their older films like Dumbo a lot, they actually used a special camera to make those films more realistic.",Neutral
523,wow I didn't know that I guess the movie Frozen was the first disney movie to be directed by a female,Surprised
523," That's surprising, you'd think a huge company would be more progressive. Maybe they value celebrity stars more, the original vultures in the jungle book were actually supposed to be voiced by the Beatles.",Surprised
523,wow that would have been cool! did you know that the lion king was dubbed into zulu for its release?,Surprised
524,Are you a fan of Disney films?,Curious to dive deeper
524," yes,definitely i like Disney film ",Happy
524,Glad to hear it. Did you know that The Lion King was the first Disney film to be dubbed in Zulu for it's African release?,Curious to dive deeper
524," Yes i know a little bit this film Directed by Roger Allers, Rob Minkoff. With Matthew Broderick is it right.",Happy
524," I'm honestly not sure who directed it. I was quite young when it came out. The main character was Simba, a lion. Speaking of directors, did you know that Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman. ",Curious to dive deeper
524," yes,Frozen, for which she earned an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Lee is the first female director",Happy
524,Yes that is correct. I'm glad to see that they did that but sad that it took them so long. I see a lot of Disney toys. Did you also know that the toy industry gets involved in Disney films before the beginning of the film's production?,Curious to dive deeper
524,I don't know about it please explain the details,Happy
524,They prepare to make toys before the movie has even began filming. I was wondering how toys came out so quickly to promote a movie.,Surprised
524,I also think about it.,Happy
524," Also, apparently in the 70's Disney recycled a lot of animation frames so there are identical scenes in some movies. I am going to have to look out for those. ",Curious to dive deeper
524," okay,do you like dog?",Happy
524,I do like dogs. I also like cats. I like all animals really ha ha.,Happy
524,Do you have them at home?,Happy
524,I have cats. I had dogs growing up but we have a lot of stray cats around my home and we took a couple in so now we are out of pet space.,Neutral
524," okay,how do you feel about hockey?",Happy
524,I don't mind hockey. I do know that Canada is the only country in the world with two national sports and they are hockey and lacrosse.,Neutral
524," i like hockey,The referee supervises the game, calls the penalties, determines if goals are scored and handles faceoffs at center ice at the start of each period.",Happy
524,It is very action oriented. It certainly moves quickly. Did you know that if they switch between a hockey rink and a basketball court that the hockey rink remains under the basketball court? I thought they completely swapped them out.,Surprised
524,sorry i don't know about it,Happy
524,I didn't either.,Neutral
525," Hello, what do you think about Lane Lambert and the peculiar day of the wedding?",Curious to dive deeper
525," That is a bit different, I guess his daughter ate Lucky Charms out of the cup during this thing. ",Curious to dive deeper
525," I think there was a lot of support in social media, from both sides of the family and that is just great!",Curious to dive deeper
525,Yeah I can support that myself.  Are you a big hockey fan in general?,Curious to dive deeper
525," I do like hockey, you know ice hockey rings are actually basketball courts when they are not in use!",Curious to dive deeper
525," Yeah isn't that so interesting, I have seen time lapse videos before of them being changed and its so cool. ",Curious to dive deeper
525," I agree, its a nice thing to watch, you know there was a player that was traded for $1 and then won four Stanely Cups! isnt that crazy! Someone definetely got fired over that decision",Surprised
525," Yeah imagine the scout and guy in charge of making that decision, I'm sure they didn't last. ",Curious to dive deeper
525," Yeah, hockey sure is a hard game to play, you know that a player can lose 8 punds per game",Surprised
525," Wow, that is a ton, but I guess they wear a lot of gear and don't stop moving around the whole game when they are on the ice. ",Curious to dive deeper
525," Its a demanding game for sure, you have to be in a good physical shape, there are many types of hockey, thats I fact I didnt know about",Curious to dive deeper
525," Yeah I guess our hockey isn't the most popular version around the world, I din't know that. ",Curious to dive deeper
525," Yeah apparently bandy, field and ice hockey are 3 of them and apparently there are more versions of the game",Curious to dive deeper
525," Really interesting, do you have any idea of what kind of hockey bandy is?  And did you know Canada is the only country with 2 national sports, hockey being one of them. ",Curious to dive deeper
525," I have no idea either,  I guess thats why they have a pretty good hockey team, I heard the Canadian olympic team of 1924 was a great team",Curious to dive deeper
525," Yeah I heard that as well, I think they only gave up three goals the whole tournament! ",Curious to dive deeper
525," Yeah and they score more than 130, that is a humilliating loss for the other team",Surprised
525,Oh yeah the other teams all got humiliated sounds like.  Do you know if the first winter games was in Canada?,Curious to dive deeper
525," I do not know that although its something worth googleling, I think its an interesting fact to know,",Curious to dive deeper
525," Whoops, I hate when I do that.  Do you have a favorite hockey team?",Curious to dive deeper
525," I dont have a favorite team, I like to watch the game and support the US team but thats about it.",Curious to dive deeper
526,are you a Henry David Thoreau fan?,Angry
526," No, I had never heard of him.",Curious to dive deeper
526,he won a novel about neirology was a Nationa Book Award,Neutral
526,I thought it was rather odd that he considered a chestnut tree as having feelings.,Surprised
526,yes totally - very odd but maybe wanting the Earth to have a true 'voice' through his books?,Happy
526,That is a possibility. He seems like a very intelligent man.,Happy
526,He was an amazing writer and his novels really changed American literature.,Curious to dive deeper
526,I've never been much for reading other than college text books and professional books (for my profession).,Happy
526,what profession? does that get boring?,Curious to dive deeper
526,I'm a teacher. It's always changing so never gets boring.,Happy
526,maybe throreaus writing is too existential or too advance for your classroom?,Curious to dive deeper
526,Oh absolutely. It's too existential and too advance for my simple mind as well.,Neutral
526,what grade are your kids?,Curious to dive deeper
526,3 to 5,Neutral
526,oh lol -yes you need Dr Seuss ha ha ha!,Happy
526," lol, well thankfully we're reading things such as Because of Winn Dixie and The Whipping Boy.",Neutral
526,I love love love Because of Winn Dixie!!! Do you ever discuss Earth and how it's the only planet to house life?,Happy
526,Yes! That was the part of all of the information that I could relate to. We've been studying the solar system.,Happy
526,Oh how sweet - that's a great age to start talking about the Earth axis and rotation (spin) using a basketball and fun stuff!,Curious to dive deeper
526,I can totally see how Jupiter saves Earth from so many asteroids.,Happy
526,How?!?!/,Happy
526,It is the largest planet with so many rings. I can picture it spinning slapping asteroids back the way they came.,Happy
526,That's a great visual - and I guess probably true! Our earth has so many issue now with climate control and losing forests.,Neutral
526,I agree. It's an ever changing earth so everything else is changing too.,Neutral
526,yes everything is ever changing - don't know that it can be linked to just one thing.,Neutral
526," ""You could fit all the planets in between earth and the moon and still have room left over to spare."" Now that's interesting!",Surprised
526,that is fascinating!   and the fact that 70% of earth is still covered with water / oceans.  So much to explore,Curious to dive deeper
526," It is. However, I'm not one who would want to go to outer space or question the universe. I appreciate it as an amazing mystery.",Happy
526,I agree - there are some things that don't need answers or to be explored but just to be seen as is and enjoyed.,Neutral
526," I absolutely agree. As for AI, I'm not sure how I feel.",Happy
526,it's been great talking to you!  Merry Christmas!,Neutral
526,The same to you!,Happy
526,have  great rest of the day!,Neutral
527,I recently learned that the earth is the densest planet in the solar system.  I wonder if that helps it to support all of the water on it.,Neutral
527,That is one possibility. Water is a very important resource that helps give life on earth.,Neutral
527,Yes it does and the earth's surface is covered by about 71% of water.  The polar regions are covered in ice but that is just frozen water so-more water on the earth's surface.,Neutral
527,That is true although I am not much into the science of earth. However I do appreciate the facts about the environment.,Neutral
527,Do you like planets in general?  Have you seen or noticed the five planets in the sky at night that can be seen by looking at them?,Neutral
527,I like planets. And yes I have been able to see them when they are noticeable. I love It when I can see the stars so bright and clear. It's a shame that there aren't so many areas where you can see them due to Earth's atmosphere being affected.,Curious to dive deeper
527,I agree with you on that.  It's extremely unfortunate that more than 80% of our planet's forests have been destroyed.,Neutral
527,It is very devastating. Hard to believe that so many years ago there was so many trees and other living creatures we can't even see alive today anymore.,Neutral
527," I know.  It makes me wonder what the planet was really like originally.  I know scientists say that in the beginning a day was on just over 5 hours long but I'm not sure they can actually know that.  So, I still wonder what all happened here long ago and what life was like.",Neutral
527,Yeah I know what you mean. It doesn't seem logical that it was only 5 hour days. Although if they believe that then their time table of billions of years is very flawed.,Curious to dive deeper
527,Good point!  What do you think about all of the helium going to be gone from the planet by the end of the century?,Surprised
527,I am a littler concerned because who knows how it will affect the planet. I mean Helium is used for a few things. For all we know it may even affect gravity somewhat.,Neutral
527,You're absolutely right.  We don't know exactly what will happen.  It may cause us to lose other things.  The steady depletion of the helium will probably create problems as we go along.,Neutral
527,It most likely will. I also wonder why the Helium is depleting so much and why it will be completely gone. I mean it just makes me think as to why this resource is really going down.,Neutral
527," I hadn't thought about that the reason why it is.  That is interesting to consider.  I mean, is it because of forest depletion or something else?",Neutral
527," It could be because of forest depletion or it could be because of all the pollution. Plus with the billions of people, resources are being taken and hardly being created. ",Neutral
527," I wonder if it's a chain of life sort of thing too. I mean, if an animal becomes extinct that can change the population of another animal species and so on.  Could it be that elements have that kind of effect on each other?  If so, what did the planet lose that is causing helium to go away?",Neutral
527,That is a lot to think about and to consider. I mean our planet Earth took a huge change in environment during the era of factories and iron and metal industry taking off.,Curious to dive deeper
527," Yes it did and now it will change with artificial intelligence.  As machines become more ""intelligent"" and there are more of them I wonder what that will do to the environment.",Neutral
527,Artifical Intelligence is definitely something that is on the rise. I have seen videos of robots cooking food. The possibilities of robots does make one think life could be easier but at what cost?,Happy
527,How far will they go too?  Facebook is trying to develop one that can understand emotions.,Neutral
528,Do you like to read?,Curious to dive deeper
528,I do like to read. Mostly mystery thrillers and sci-fi. How bout yourself?,Curious to dive deeper
528," I do, mostly non fiction books, there are also great books about trees, they might sound boring but they can be really interesting",Curious to dive deeper
528,I don't know if I could ever just read about about trees. I could read a book that was more about the Earth as a whole. The cosmos are fascinating.,Neutral
528," I agree, the cosmos is fascinating and earth is too, so many planets out there, all the wonders they hold",Curious to dive deeper
528,I like to think about everything we don't know. Like astronomers possibly detecting building blocks for life in a planetary system 455 light-years away.,Curious to dive deeper
528," I think thats a real possibility and waht about that planet that has glass precipitation, hostile planet",Curious to dive deeper
528,It's so mysterious. And everything we see when we look is how what we are seeing was millions of years ago. It just takes the info that long to get to us. Who know what they are like now.,Curious to dive deeper
528," Yeah, maybe a lot more different, we wont be alive to find that out though, ",Curious to dive deeper
528,Nope. I'm kind of hoping we develop AI further soon and maybe that expedites how we are able to see and travel through the universe,Curious to dive deeper
528," I hope that too, AI can be the sollution to many problems",Curious to dive deeper
528," AI is really an interesting topic that should discussed more in politics. It's going to open up so many possibilities, but it will also lead to a large loss of employment and could even be dangerous.",Curious to dive deeper
528," It can, it can surely affect the economy, dangerous in many ways, ",Curious to dive deeper
528,Just throwing some ideas out there - we may either have to come with a universal basic income. Or the AI will just get rid of a bunch of us lol,Curious to dive deeper
528," Yeah like in the movies, AI can beat our brains they even crushed all human records on a game called the puzle game 2048",Curious to dive deeper
528," Yeah, Chess and Go as well. Did you see the movie Ex Machina?",Curious to dive deeper
528," I didnt, whats it about?",Curious to dive deeper
528,It's about this guy who wins a developer competition and gets to spend a weekend with the CEO on this remote island. It turns out the guy was meant to be the human component for the CEO's AI testing.,Curious to dive deeper
528," Interesting plot I have to watch that one, did you hear about Facebook and the AI the company is developing?",Curious to dive deeper
528," Yes, kind of scary isn't it. It's like Zuckerberg is building a catalog of all of us through AI and what we post on Facebook",Fearful
528," It is scary, the AI will understand emotions, identify objects and predict actions, ",Fearful
529," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
529,Not bad.    Do you know anything about Henry David Thoreau?,Happy
529," I know a bit about him, he is a environmentalist I believe, right?",Curious to dive deeper
529," Yes, but he was also an author.    Lots of others were inspired by his example.",Happy
529," I get his point though, I mean 80% of the earth's forests have been destroyed already",Curious to dive deeper
529," Speaking of the earth, how old is the planet?",Happy
529," As far as I know, I think about 4.5 billion years ago",Curious to dive deeper
529,That is a long time ago.    How much of the surface of the planet is water?,Curious to dive deeper
529," I believe it is about 71%, I was always told 3/4ths when I was younger",Curious to dive deeper
529,That makes sense.     Do you know what the core is made from?,Happy
529," It is essentially iron and heat, so hot most of it is liquid, and that is what causes volcano eruptions",Curious to dive deeper
529,Interesting.     Did you know the earth is quite a bit more dense than the sun!,Surprised
529," I did not know that actually, but I guess it kinda makes sense since the sun is mostly gas",Curious to dive deeper
529,I know there are some other names people call our planet.    Do you know any of them?,Curious to dive deeper
529," No, I am not too familiar, what other names do people call it?",Curious to dive deeper
529," I've heard of GAIA and Tellus, but there probably others.",Happy
529," That is interesting, is GAIA an acronym?",Curious to dive deeper
529," No, I think it is from mythology.     Do you know why no mission to Jupiter is possible?",Curious to dive deeper
529," No, why is that? I know it has a huge moon though",Curious to dive deeper
529," Something about radiation, but that may just be something I heard.",Surprised
529," Huh, we luckily we will probably never need to inhabit it at least",Curious to dive deeper
530,How ya doing? Have you heard of the author Henry Thoreau? His novel about trees sounds exciting.,Curious to dive deeper
530,Yeah it does... who would of thought a book about trees could be interesting?!,Surprised
530,Yeah my thoughts indeed. I love trees and nature. It's a shame that more than 80% of our forests have been destroyed.,Angry
530,Yeah i agree... i really hate when they build developments they chop down all the trees leaving none! :(,Sad
530,Yeah so sad. Earth is always changing. By the end of this century it will be helium free!,Surprised
530,That's weird that the hudson bay area in canada has less gravity?,Curious to dive deeper
530,Oh I didn't know that. What is crazy is that a day used to be only 5.5 hours when the earth was first formed.,Surprised
530,WOW... could you imagine?  LOL,Surprised
530,No that would change a lot for sure! I love looking at the stars too. Astronomers detected building blocks of life in a planetary system 455 light years away!,Curious to dive deeper
530,Really... how is it possible to see and collect data from that far away?,Surprised
530,Yeah I would like to know that myself. There is even a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph! Sounds like a  warzone over there!,Surprised
530,OUCH!  The universe is really an amazing place!,Surprised
530,Yes it is. Uranus actually rotates sideways and rolls around the sun instead of spinning!,Surprised
530,Hmmmmm... i wonder why?  Is it really a planet or just a giant rock?,Curious to dive deeper
530,Yeah I would like to ask an astronomer that. Do you like AI? It is becoming so smart these days. Stanford has free AI classes to learn more.,Curious to dive deeper
530,Oh really... AI is really cool!  I want to take those classes!,Curious to dive deeper
530,Yeah it would be worth it. Facebook is even developing AI tools!,Curious to dive deeper
530,I am sure they are... to further steal our information i'm sure!,Fearful
530," Haha yes. Mark Zuckerberg needs to learn some things about privacy. They are apparently designing it to learn more about user emotions, identify objects in photos, and predict user actions.",Fearful
530,That stuff is interesting and scary at the same time!,Curious to dive deeper
530," Agreed. AI is also crushing all human records solving puzzles as well, which would be expected. Have a good weekend!",Surprised
531,Hello! Do you like lady gaga?,Happy
531,Yeah I think she is fascinating. The movie she did with Bradley Cooper was great.,Curious to dive deeper
531," I haven't seen it, but I do like that song from it! Her name came from the predictive text glitch that changed radio to lady! Interesting! ",Happy
531,Very interesting. A star is born is good you should watch it. It was Bradley Cooper's directorial debut.,Happy
531," I will definitely check that out! Her favorite band is Iron maiden, I wouldn't have guessed that!",Happy
531,I wouldn't have guess that either. She apparently has a 11.4 million followers on Twitter.,Surprised
531,That seems more assumable! She was also asked by the lapd to tweet them about some roadwork once!,Happy
531,Oh wow I have never heard of followers being used like that. Elton John chose Lady Gaga as his son's godmother. I didn't know they were close.,Surprised
531,I didn't either! Do you remember the show boiling points on MTV? Lady gaga was on it before she was famous.,Happy
531,Yes I vaguely remember that show. I will have to look it up. She's one of the best selling music artists in history now. I bet she reminisces on those boiling point days.,Happy
531," Absolutely! Speaking of famous artists, Queens guitarist has a phd in astrophysics! ",Happy
531," Yeah I remember that from the movie Bohemian Rhapsody, did you see it? He also uses coins as guitar picks.",Surprised
531," I didn't see that one either, i'm really behind on movies it seems! The guitarist for muse hold a world record for most guitars smashed on a tour! ",Happy
531,Yes I recommend that movie as well. Wow that must be a lot. Eddie Van Halen set a studio speaker on fire once!,Surprised
531,That's crazy! Pink floyd turned a grand houseboat into a floating recording studio. That sounds awesome!,Happy
531,That sounds very awesome. I bet the river Thames has never seen such a party!,Happy
531,I bet! Linkin park played 324 concerts in 2001 alone.They must be busy people!,Happy
531,Wow very busy indeed. It must be nice to have such a successful debut album.,Happy
531," Yeah, they were pretty popular in the early 2000s. The ramones have played a total of 2263 concerts!",Happy
531,That is also a lot of concerts. I like going to concerts but the loud amplified sound of the electric guitar is very deafening. Thanks for talking with me this afternoon.,Neutral
531," Yeah, it can get pretty loud! It was nice chatting with you!",Happy
531,Have a great afternoon. Bye!,Neutral
532,Are you a fan of Lady Gaga?,Curious to dive deeper
532,I am!  I've been a fan since her EP The Fame Monster came out in 2009.,Happy
532,Did you know her favorite band is Iron Maiden?,Curious to dive deeper
532,I didn't know that.  How interesting!  Elton John chose Lady Gaga as his son's godmother!,Happy
532,That is pretty cool. Did you know her name came from a predictive text glitch?,Curious to dive deeper
532," I didn't know that.  She was on MTV's ""boiling points"" before she was famous.",Happy
532," Yeah, that I did know. Or I knew she was on TV. ",Curious to dive deeper
532,The LAPD asked Lady Gaga to tweet her 11.4 million followers information about some upcoming roadwork. lol,Happy
532,Interesting. Ever seen Linkin Park in concert?,Curious to dive deeper
532,I never have but wish I did.,Happy
532,Apparently they played 324 concerts in 2001.,Curious to dive deeper
532,That's a lot of shows in one year!  Probably due to the success of their debut album.,Happy
532,That it is. It is sad what happened to Chester though.,Curious to dive deeper
532," I agree.  Depression is a terrible thing that doesn't get the attention it deserves.  I feel bad for those people who suffer from it.  In Croatia, there is an ancient Roman amphiteathre that is still used as a concert venue.",Happy
532,Interesting. I wonder what it looks like?,Curious to dive deeper
532,I bet it's pretty neat looking.  In 1972 Pink Floyd ironically recorded a live concert at a ancient Roman amphitheatre in Pompeii with no audience!,Happy
532," Interesting, I'm not a huge fan of Pink Floyd. ",Curious to dive deeper
532," I never was either.  In 2002, Creed played a concert that was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band.  That must have been a really bad show. lol",Happy
532," Yeah, they must have really been terrible. Kind of funny when you think about it. I never listened to much Creed. Well, nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
532,Did you know that Queen's Brian May has a phd in astrophysics?  Impressive!  Nice chatting with you too!,Happy
532," I actually did. He was also very inventive on guitar. Well, nice chatting with you too!",Happy
533,Have you seen the movie a star is born yet?,Curious to dive deeper
533,I have. It was wonderful. Bradley Cooper did a wonderful job playing the part.,Happy
533,What did you think of the drugs and alcohol in the opening scene,Happy
533,I thought that it was a great way to catch viewers attention and it also set the stage for what was to come.,Neutral
533,What did you think of Lady Gaga in it? This was her first major picture,Happy
533," Lady Gaga did well. When she went onstage for the first performance, her voice was hard to ignore.",Happy
533,She does have an amazing voice. I really felt like their chemistry was good for this film as well,Surprised
533,It was. It seemed like she was learning from him. Did you think that there were any choppy patches during the film?,Neutral
533,I felt like her own backstory was rushed and not put together well,Curious to dive deeper
533," Lady Gaga's real name is Stefani, I did not know that.",Neutral
533,Oh I did! I am quite a fan of her actually I love her poker face song and her crazy artistic clothing,Surprised
533," She is definitely an artist of her own. She once bought $1000 worth of pizza for fans waiting in line for her, what a nice gesture!",Happy
533,I did not know that! She really does love her fans though!,Happy
533," She was also on MTV's show ""boiling points"" before she was famous, I think that is interesting. ",Surprised
533,Wow what is that I have never even heard of it! You seem to know a lot of personal knowledge about her! that is awesome,Curious to dive deeper
533,It would be awesome if they somehow did a sequel to the movie.,Happy
533,I do not think that will happen. I am not sure how they could progress the story into that. What do you think it would look like?,Curious to dive deeper
533," I don't know what it would look like. I just liked the movie so much. Bradly Cooper played the part of a ""washed up"" boy so hard, which I thought would be challenging for him.",Neutral
533,I know! He is so clean cut in real life that his ability to fill that roll caught me off guard!,Neutral
533,I often wonder if there is truth behind stars having to take pills or alcohol to make it through a concert like in the movie.,Neutral
533,I think a lot of rock stars become overwhelmed with the fame. I can't imagine it is easy to have no privacy and so much demand on a person so I think it does happen a lot,Curious to dive deeper
533,It is not all that it is cracked up to be.,Neutral
533,Yeah I think it is a harder life then people imagine,Neutral
533,It is good that they show on the big screen that not even stars have a perfect life.,Neutral
533,I agree it helps people see the truth,Neutral
533,The grass is not always greener.,Neutral
533,SO what else did you like about,Neutral
533,I enjoyed the part when they stopped in at the little nightclub.,Happy
533,What did you think of the ending,Neutral
534," Hi there, are much of a movie lover?",Curious to dive deeper
534," Hi, I do like movies.  Do you?  Have you seen the new A star is born with lady gaga and bradley cooper?",Neutral
534,No I have not yet but I am watching it next week with friends. How about you? It rose to fame tso quickly,Surprised
534,I haven't seen it yet either.  I heard it's good and that Bradley Cooper directed it as well as stars in it.,Neutral
534," Yeah there is a lot of buzz. And then you have Lady Gaga on the other hand, they seem to make a great duo.",Happy
534,That's what I've heard.  They say she is not as good an actress as she is a singer but due to editing the movie makes the most of her singing.,Neutral
534," Yeah, I guess. Apparently she got her name Lady because of a text glitch, from radio.",Surprised
534,I didn't know that. I always wondered where it came from.  I like that she takes care of her fans.  I heard she bought a thousand dollars worth of pizza for fans waiting in line to see her.,Neutral
534,Nice. Even LAPD work with her asking her to tweet that there is road work upcoming because she has so many followers.,Surprised
534," That's pretty cool.  Speaking of cool, did you know that the Foo Fighters played a concert once that was so loud it showed up on new zealands seismic monitors?",Neutral
534,Wow that is amazing. There is an ancient roman amphitheatre in crotia that can still be used for concerts. I wonder if theyhave played there.,Surprised
534,I don't know but it would be great if they did.  That story about lady gaga buying pizza had me thinking about relations with fans.  I heard that a lady on her way to a dave mathews concert stopped to help a cyclist who turned out to be dave mathews!  I bet she got back stage tickets!,Neutral
534,Wow you never know really. Do you attend music concerts much?,Curious to dive deeper
534,i use too.  Do you?  I would have went to the ABBA reunion tour concert but they turned down a billion dollars to do it.,Neutral
534," I do from time to time. I know some bands do a lot of concerts, like Linkin park did 324 in 2011 alone.",Surprised
534," Wow, they were some busy people!  I'd like to go to this concert I heard about that was held for dogs.  Back in 2010 a man and his wife held a high frequency concert just for dogs that were around.",Neutral
534," That is very different. And Creed, apparently their concert was so bad that people sued them.",Happy
534,Hahaha! That's awful and so sad for them!  The band Deep Purple had people pass out due to the loudness of their music. I wonder which would be better to pass out or endure Creed.,Neutral
534,Go figure. Do you have a favorite instrument?,Curious to dive deeper
534,I like the piano and the saxophone.  I've tried to play the guitar before but the strings hurt my fingers way too much.  Do you have a favorite?,Neutral
534," I think the violin for me. Speaking of the guitar though, Eddie Van Halen set the speakers on fire when playing the guitar for 'beat it'",Surprised
534,I wonder if he could play the world's smallest guitar. It was built by some people at Cornell University.,Neutral
535,Are you a Lady Gaga fan?,Curious to dive deeper
535," Yes, musically and as an actress. I just heard a new extended version of a star is born is coming out. I can't wait to see the extra footage.",Curious to dive deeper
535,I have not seen it at all but I am interested. It got a lot of acclaim. Do you know that Lady Gaga is the godmother of Elton John's son?,Curious to dive deeper
535," Yes, shes tweeted about him a lot. You should follow her on twitter she has well over 11 million followers and posts all kinds of neat stuff.",Curious to dive deeper
535," I just recently followed her so I missed a lot. Speaking of, did you also know that the LAPD asked her to tweet her followers about some upcoming roadwork?",Curious to dive deeper
535,I guess they have a lot less followers. Smart idea! She's come a long way since she was on boiling points.,Surprised
535,I forgot that show existed. I had no idea she was on that. I'm sure she's a bit embarrassed about that now.,Surprised
535," Maybe, you know it's funny I love her music but she's not really what I'd consider typical to what I listen to. Then I find out her favorite band is Iron Maiden and it makes sense.",Surprised
535,I didn't know about that either. I usually prefer rock as well but I'm not against some catchy pop here and there to get my day going or to work out to. It has it's place for sure.,Curious to dive deeper
535,I just wish she'd tour more. I have seen a few of her concerts but there are not that many opportunties.,Curious to dive deeper
535,You would think she would since that's a lot of the income for singers now. Do you enjoy going to concerts?,Curious to dive deeper
535," Yes, how about you? I think Linkin Park is the band I've seen the most. They play a lot of shows. Or at least they did :( Sadly there will be no more.",Sad
535,I used to like it a lot but I don't enjoy the crowds quite as much anymore. I did hear that Linkin Park played 324 concerts in one year. That's insane!,Surprised
535," Yeah I'm really going to miss Chester. They played some really great venues, I wish there were more dvds. In Croatia a roman amphitheater is still in use, I'd love to go there.",Curious to dive deeper
535," That would be an amazing place to attend a concert. The pictures, the sound, the memory. I would love to do that too. ",Happy
535," I'm glad I got to see Linkin Park so many times when I did, since you never know when it will be over. I'm sad I never got to see the Ramones though. Before my time. They played over 2000 shows!",Surprised
535,I would have seen the Ramones. They have very catchy music and I'm not even a fan of much punk. I had no idea they played that many shows. I know they played at CBGB's a lot so I wonder how many of those were there and how many were tours.,Curious to dive deeper
535,I think there used to be a sign at CBGB's how many times they played there. Of course like the Ramones that place is long gone now too. I'm glad Roger Waters still tours but it would be nice to see Pink Floyd again.,Curious to dive deeper
535,It's sad that it's gone. It was such a relic of a cultural movement. I would love to see Pink Floyd. Did you know that they filmed a concert with no audience?,Curious to dive deeper
535,Yes in Pompeii! I have the DVD. I believe it was just to have a chance to play in that historic roman venue.,Happy
535,I'm glad they were able to do it then. It was very nice chatting with you. You have a great day.,Neutral
536," heloo,  how are you doing? Ugg boots were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after leaving the cold ocean",Surprised
536,that makes sense! professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pair of shoes in a week. that must be  expensive,Curious to dive deeper
536,Yeah I know right! The nokia company originally got big by making rubber boots. in the 1800's. they still make rubber boots.,Surprised
536,i had no idea. you can put tea bags in stinky shoes to absorb the smell,Neutral
536,Ive actually tried this with my snowboarding boots it works great!,Surprised
536,thats a neat trick and I might have to try it! although I missed the part about dry my thought was wet and that it would make your shoes wet. lol did you know 500 year old shoes out perform todays shoes,Surprised
536," I wonder in what way?  I know they were custom before.  The phrase ""pulling oneself up by their bootstraps"" originally meant ""doing something that is pretty much impossible"".",Surprised
536,Maybe because shoes used to be designed for function and not fashion,Neutral
536," In 1838, a man stopped on the boulevard du temple in paris to get his boots cleaned. he and the cleaner stood still for at least seven minutes on the street, and accidentally became the first people in history to be photographed.",Neutral
536,I wonder how they accidentally became photographed?,Curious to dive deeper
536," No clue,  right place right time.  Maybe he was in the background or something. Farmers used to walk turkeys from norfolk to london for the christmas markets. in the early 18th century, around 250,000 turkeys, many in little custom boots, would take the three-month walk.",Surprised
536,wikileaks published the governments plan to destroy wikileaks. lol talk about irony,Happy
536,lol weird. 86% of the land in nevada is owned by the us government,Curious to dive deeper
536,It must be to hide all of the UFO's! a man in france sold the eiffel tower...twice,Surprised
536,lol how does that even happen! In 2008 the norwegian government donated $1bn to help save the amazon rainforest.,Neutral
536,I am pretty sure that was money not well spent since we always here about deforestation.  gov't is supposed to be the balance between individual freedom and  tyranny...somebody should tell the US government that,Neutral
536," In 2006, the us passed legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the geneva conventions",Neutral
536,stephon marbury promoted a line of shoes but was not paid to endorse them,Neutral
536,Thats unfair!,Surprised
536,agreed!,Disgusted
536,Good talking to you,Surprised
537," Hi, how are you doing this evening?",Neutral
537,Great.  Did you know Ugg Boots were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm?,Curious to dive deeper
537," Surprised to hear that. I wonder how the surfer would fare with 5,000 year old shoes. ",Neutral
537,They would probably make them into sandals and put dry tea bags in them to remove the smell.,Angry
537," Ah, yes, but what kind of tea? Free-range organic tea? NFL player Steve Smith leaves his cleats on the field after every game. He hopes to raise awareness of homeless people without shoes. I bet he doesn't put tea in his shoes.",Neutral
537," I bet they get stolen.  So many of these rich football people and their ""caring.""  The need to put their money where their mouth is like Norway.  They gave $1B to save Amazon rain forests. ",Fearful
537,I wish the US gov’t would do something like that.The US gov’t owns 86% of the land in Nevada. I want to know what secret activities they’re engaged in there. Have that many aliens landed in Nevada? Is that their refueling station?,Neutral
537,Most of that is BLM land leased to ranchers.  That other 14% must be Vegas.,Angry
537," A man in France pretended to be a government official, and sold the Eiffel Tower not once, but twice. Maybe he could sell the land in Nevada for the US government and then the proceeds could go to the Amazon.",Neutral
537,Sounds like a plan... He could get in the business of selling used ballet shoes.  They can go through 4 pairs a week.,Angry
537,Four pairs. I wonder how they would do with the 5000 year old shoes though.,Neutral
537," Their toes much suffer too.  Maybe there should be ballet boots.  If they fall, they can pull themselves up by their bootstraps. ",Angry
537,Maybe Stephon Marbury could make an inexpensive line of pointe shoes.,Neutral
537,Another great idea... Or use the boots that the turkey movers do in Norfolk.,Angry
537,Turkey mover? Is that a profession?,Neutral
537," Yeah, farmers used to walk turkeys from Norfolk to London in the 18th century. ",Angry
537,That sounds like a pleasant excursion. Giant squawking birds for miles on end.,Neutral
537," Yeah, it only marginally beats out starvation or selling the Eiffel Tower. ",Angry
537," Well, hey man, I had a groovy time chatting with you this evening. I hope that you find the shoes that suit you, whatever you choose to do. (turkey mover)",Happy
537,Same here -- nice chat.  I sure won't be ballet...,Angry
537," Hey, don't sell yourself short! Turkey ballet!",Neutral
537,Hee.,Neutral
537,CYA,Neutral
538,Do you shop at LL Bean?,Curious to dive deeper
538," Yes, I do.  I wondered when they would stop their lifetime refund guarantee.  People nowadays are just plain crooked.",Disgusted
538,I was only just made aware of that offer.  There are always people willing to exploit a system like that.,Sad
538," But, to go as far as to buy things at a yard sale and try to return them, that's just taking it to a new level of exploitation.  A crook will always be a crook, for sure!",Surprised
538," This kind of promise works well in a small group, but once it goes national you lose the personal connection, and some will exploit it.",Sad
538," How true.  On a side note, do you own any UGG boots?",Curious to dive deeper
538," Not my style.  I see them around all the time now, are they comfortable?",Curious to dive deeper
538," Yeah, they are very comfortable and quite warm.  Do you know they were invented by surfers?",Curious to dive deeper
538,Looking at Uggs I would not associate them with surfing.  I suppose they keep you feet warm?,Curious to dive deeper
538," Yes, the surfers would put them on after leaving that cold ocean water, to warm up!",Happy
538," My boot and shoe supply is limited.  I have some work shoes and some running shoes, and one pair of dress shoes.  ",Curious to dive deeper
538," Well, that's really all one needs!",Neutral
538," I've tried the trick with the tea bag and smelly shoes, it does remove the smelly odor, replaces it with Earl Grey.",Happy
538," How cool, I'll have to give that a try, I have a stinky pair of gym shoes!",Surprised
538," So Nokia use to make boots, difficult to see how they got into phones from that.",Curious to dive deeper
538," Rubber boots to be exact, and I think they still make them, too!",Surprised
538,Probably best to stick with the boots.  The whole Smart Phone thing has left Nokia behind.  Maybe they need to pull themselves up by their boot straps.,Happy
538," That phrase got its start by meaning to do something that is pretty much impossible.  At this point, I think Nokia has lost the phone game!",Surprised
538,Thinking about that phrase you can see what it's original meaning was.  Maybe it changed because no one has boot straps now?,Curious to dive deeper
538,That's true.  Do you know that pro ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week?,Neutral
538," A week!  I'm glad my daughter gave up dance after just a few sessions.  Have a good day, nice chatting.",Neutral
539,Hello - how are you doing today?,Curious to dive deeper
539,I'm great! Are you interesting in government?,Neutral
539,I am interested in some government things. I saw that Wikileaks published the government's plan to destroy Wikileaks.,Surprised
539," Wikileaks is not going to be outsmarted by the government. I'm not sure how the gov't could destroy Wikileaks anyway. Too many sites, too many backups.",Neutral
539,I agree. Did you know 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the government?,Surprised
539,The gov't must be up to something in Nevada. Maybe Wikileaks knows something about this.,Neutral
539,That's where Area 51 is located so I'm sure there are lots of secret bases in that state.,Curious to dive deeper
539," I think Area 51 is in New Mexico, but I'm not sure. Lots of open space in Nevada. ",Neutral
539," Oh yea you might be right lol. In 2006, the US passed a bill that would protect the government employees from being charged for violating the geneva conventions.",Surprised
539," I think that is wrong, but probably there to protect military contractors and stuff. A lot of war going on in 2006. Probably a lot of liability. ",Neutral
539," Yea, I was deployed to Iraq for the war back in 2005-2006 and then again in 2007.",Curious to dive deeper
539,Hm. I guess that you would be protected under the law. You made it back safe and sound I trust? The gov't has no plans to send you again?,Neutral
539," Yes, I made it back safe and sound thankfully. I was infantry so had some close calls. No plans to deploy again. My enlisted contract ended back in 2008 so I'm finished and 33 years old now.",Happy
539," Your gov't service is done! The government has actually shut down 17 times over the past 37 years. it happened 3 times in 1977. During the recent shutdown, most of the military got paid, if I remember correctly.",Neutral
539,Oh wow I didn't know that. That's good the military stills gets paid during the shutdown. Do you like boots?,Curious to dive deeper
539,I don't wear boots usually. I think they are useful for some kinds of work and for cold weather. You?,Neutral
539,I always wear boots. Especially when I ride my motorcycle.,Happy
539," That's good! Stay safe. Dress for the slide, not for the ride.",Neutral
539,Haha yep. The Ugg boot was invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after leaving the cold ocean.,Surprised
539," And now it's a fashion statement. I don't think the boots are stylish, but what would I know. I don't wear boots.",Neutral
539,Great talking to you!,Happy
540,Hi there. Have you ever been to the White House?,Neutral
540,i have never been to the white house. i would like to go some day. have you been?,Neutral
540," I haven't. But if you ever go to Ireland or France, you can see it there, too! Evidently there are twin White Houses there.",Neutral
540," I bet that it would be a good replica too. i guess i could start there, maybe try out the oval office, see how it feels.",Neutral
540,Haha. Did you know George Bush had solar panels put back on the White House?,Neutral
540," yeah, carter put them on, reagan too them off. what about trump? what happened to the panels?",Neutral
540,I'm not sure. They should keep them there. It's good for the environment! I'm surprised Bush was an advocate being an oil fan.,Neutral
540,I think that he did that for PR reasons. i think that it would look bad for an oilman to do that. i would love more solar in the country.,Neutral
540," Teddy Roosevelt was quite the conservationist, as well. He banned Christmas trees from the White House during his day.",Neutral
540," Teddy always went out hunting wild animals. i dont understand his thinking. no trees, but animals, yes?",Neutral
540,Maybe he was only hunting the animals that were overpopulated and bad for the environment?,Neutral
540," Maybe, that is true. i just thought that he would want to leave the animals alone. He was behind the national parks too. great guy for conservation.",Neutral
540," Yeah, but there are some animals that can become a problem if they aren't hunted, unfortunately. Just the circle of life. ",Neutral
540,True. Maybe he was looking to maintain a balance. The white house still uses floppy disks in part for storing files. I wonder if they used those in Teddy Roosevelt's day? LOL,Neutral
540," Haha. I would think not. Though, I bet his documents were transcribed and put onto a floppy disk!",Neutral
540," The white house is an interesting specimen. something of a relic, a kind of time capsule. like a museum. strange how far behind govt can be.",Neutral
540,I would imagine they still use a floppy disk because it's the most secure way to store data.,Neutral
540," I guess, but i wonder about encryption and stuff like that. isnt there better tech out there? do they not have the budget for it?",Neutral
540," I'm sure, but almost all storage seems to require an internet connection these days, so who knows? Well, it's been nice chatting with you.",Neutral
540,It has been nice chatting. Have a great weekend.,Neutral
540,You too!,Neutral
541,Did you vote in the last election?,Curious to dive deeper
541,I did. Do you know how they elected people in ancient athens?,Curious to dive deeper
541," Yes they were elected by lottery, pretty awesome",Curious to dive deeper
541,Yes and it worked for them as they believed otherwise it would lead to oligarchy,Curious to dive deeper
541," Yeah, In Nevada you have the option to choose, none of these candidates",Curious to dive deeper
541," Yes I like that, it should be applied to all the other states as well",Curious to dive deeper
541,Yeah. Maybe that will help increase the voter turnover over 63%,Curious to dive deeper
541,Yeah that is a good point. Did you know the taller candidate seems to win usually?,Curious to dive deeper
541,Yes that has been the case since 1990 for 75% of the time,Curious to dive deeper
541,Right. Did you know the international observes were banned from nine states to check on the polls?,Curious to dive deeper
541,Yeah. Did you know the white house has twin buildings in other countries?,Curious to dive deeper
541,Yes those are in Ireland and France as well,Curious to dive deeper
541,Yeah. ANd they still use floppy discs to save stuff,Curious to dive deeper
541,Yeah. Did you know Roosevelt did not allow christmas trees in it?,Curious to dive deeper
541,He was that big of a conservationist so I guess that makes sense,Curious to dive deeper
541,Yeah. Bush was the one that brought the solar panels back to the house,Curious to dive deeper
541," Nice. Did you know the white house was shot in November 11, 2011?",Curious to dive deeper
541,Yes and it took them four days to figure that out,Curious to dive deeper
541,That is long considering how much security there is in that building,Curious to dive deeper
541,Exactly. Do you know who was the first president to live in it?,Curious to dive deeper
541,Yes that was John Adams in 1800. Nice chatting with you today.,Happy
542," Hi, how are you?",Happy
542,I am great! How are you!,Happy
542," Very well, thanks. Are you ready for the Presidential race in 2020?",Curious to dive deeper
542," I am! For me personally it can't get here soon enough. But whatever happens we will get by! I was reading about the talks about how George Hathaway, has a book about the Alt-Right, pretty interesting. ",Curious to dive deeper
542," Yeah. I am fearful of those groups normalizing hate speech, sorry if you're alt-right...",Fearful
542," I am definitely not Alt-Right, these groups are scary to me. All the extremist groups are very scary. A man named Tenold wrote personal accounts on a personal level with these groups. Very interesting.",Fearful
542," If I am alt-right, I do not want my name included with the KKK. However, I am not alt-roght and think they should be lumped in with them.",Fearful
542,Everyone thinks modern day KKK is not a threat even by the Alt Right but I have to say they are in my opinion. They have committed hate crimes just as much as the other groups.,Neutral
542,I agree. I think their speech is just as dangerous. It tells others that hate speech is allowable and endorsed by people like the president.,Fearful
542," Exactly, couldn't agree more. Our country is so crazy and the books these men are writing prove to be a bit scary on much hate they have seen and heard. But we hope the upcoming election might change things.",Neutral
542,I agree. It wouldn't surprise me to see someone so frustrated they run. I am thinking Michelle Obama...,Happy
542,Yes! That is really my thought too. We need a president who has a very good head on their shoulders. How awesome would that be!,Happy
542," I think she would be elected without having to outline policy, she is that popular. I think her book primed her run. It was conveniently released around exploratory committee time...",Happy
542," Exactly, I think she would have a great chance to be elected. She seems to be what we need right now!",Happy
542,I think we just need someone who doesn't marginalize a lot of the country. That's not a high bar to get over. Our current nation is that low right now... Jefferson would be rolling over in his grave.,Sad
542,I agree! We just need to hope we get good people running and hopefully more than the average 62% voter rate will climb. We really need this. Has Michelle Obama talked about running?,Neutral
542," I was just talking about this the other day with a friend. In a country with like 350M people, Hilary and Trump were the two best people we could come up with? No she has not talked about it but I could see it.",Curious to dive deeper
542," I agree, that's why I hope we can get someone who could really get this country up and running and uniting. I really think whoever ends up in the White House next is either going to completely break us or start getting us above water, so to speak.",Neutral
542,I agree. I am fearful that the Democrats will cannibalize the party and it will be tough to make whole going up against the Republican party. Nice I didn't say trump because I am skeptical he will run again. He hates bring president.,Neutral
542," Exactly. I didn't know Trump didn't like being president. I wish we were not so divided into political groups, so muxh going on. That's why I am not a liberal or conservative.",Neutral
542,Nice chatting with you!,Happy
543,Are you a skin head?,Curious to dive deeper
543," That is a really strange salutation but no, I am not a skin head. ",Sad
543,Neither am I.  I apologize I have just read some distressing material about skin heads.  Did you know skin heads opposed antifa activists?,Curious to dive deeper
543,No problem. Just a strong first sentence. I did not know that. What is the antifa?,Curious to dive deeper
543,I am not exactly sure what Antifa is either.,Curious to dive deeper
543,Just looked it up and it is a left wing autonomous militant group,Neutral
543,Ah I see seems natural they would oppose them.,Curious to dive deeper
543,Agreed. Mind if we switch to a lighter subject for the sake of this chat?,Neutral
543,Sure did you know that shirts encompass many different types of attire for the upper body?,Curious to dive deeper
543,I did not.  That makes a lot sense. I use mine to hide my shame.,Happy
543,Haha me as well shame is well hidden in shirts.,Curious to dive deeper
543,I would have fit in well during the chinese cultural revolution. They layered!,Neutral
543,Yes they had some quite interesting clothing.  It is very generic all over the world nowadays.,Curious to dive deeper
543,I had no idea the difference between a button down and a button up. Who knew!,Surprised
543,Me neither it is insane how much we do not know.,Curious to dive deeper
543,I do not know a lot more than most people. I just shake my head and smile. It has gotten me this far...,Happy
543,Sometimes we must accept our inability to change things much greater than us.  We are like a trickle of water against stone.,Curious to dive deeper
543," Speaking of water, teddy roosevelt was a conservationalist.",Happy
543,Harambe would be happy to eat pancakes in heaven.,Curious to dive deeper
543,With Prince... Seems like a fitting tribute to both...,Happy
543,Yes a fitting end to legends.,Curious to dive deeper
544,Hey there. I just learned that GOP stands for Grand Old Party. Very traditional sounding.,Curious to dive deeper
544,That is exactly what I think too. The Republican party is old school so it fits very nicely!,Happy
544,There have been a total of 19 Republican presidents...the most of any party!,Surprised
544," Wow, I didn't know that. Yes, the Republicans dominated politics nationally between 1860 and 1932! ",Surprised
544," They always emphasize their abortion position, which all stemmed from the monumental Roe vs Wade 1973 Supreme Court Ruling.",Curious to dive deeper
544," Exactly. This was their platform and their support grew its evangelicals, leading to complete alignment with Christian conservatism. A lot different from the Democratic party.",Happy
544,Yes a stark contrast to the Democrats. The two parties heritage goes back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison's Democratic-Republican Party!,Surprised
544," Yes, and the Republican party as of 2018 was the primary party of power in the USA.  Interesting though that there has not been a non republican / non democrat since 1853.",Surprised
544,Yes I wish that wasn't the case. The more variety the better. 15% of the tea party movement identified as democrats!,Surprised
544,I agree! I think we should all be open minded and not choose a side. the red and blue colors used for republicans and democrats only started being used consistently since 2000. I was watching some documentaries on youtube and it's all pretty interesting.,Happy
544,I love youtube! It is the second largest search engine on the net!,Curious to dive deeper
544,I watch Youtube a lot! Any little thing you want to find is on there! Google bought Youtube in 2006. Two huge platforms!,Happy
544,Yes they are. Gangnam Style got so many views that youtube had to upgrade the view integer to 64 bits!,Surprised
544," Wow, I remember when that was such a huge deal! Interesting that Netflix and Youtube make up half of peak internet traffic in north america. That is amazing!",Surprised
544,Yes people love to watch entertainment! Police actually have their own platform called blutube! I wonder how people can access that service?,Curious to dive deeper
544," That is awesome! The police really can benefit from that! I bet an average person can't use their site. I bet it helps them out a lot. My favorite thing to look up on youtube is music, I like the videos. Or the do it yourself video's, how about you?",Happy
544," I love DIY videos too, so helpful. I never use the like/dislike feature. But a lot of people disliked Bieber's ""baby"" video.",Surprised
544," I heard that too, which seems strange that it was the most watched video for a long time back when it 1st came out. So many people getting wealthy by having a youtube channel and following....that's what I would like to do lol!",Surprised
544,Yes it would be nice to get endorsed by youtube! You should do it! That way you can contribute to all that internet traffic! Well it was lovely chatting with you!,Happy
544," Yes, I have been looking into a subscription to a do it yourself type channel! I wonder if the Republicans and Democrats have a Youtube channel? It has been great! Have a great day!",Happy
544,Bye and see you on youtube!,Happy
545," Hi there! I'm not sure about you, but I have recently learned so much about politics!",Curious to dive deeper
545," Me too, a lot of cool facts like how the red and blue colors of republicans and democrats started in 2000",Curious to dive deeper
545,That is crazy considering how tightly aligned they are now! There has not been a US President since 1953 that was not a Democrat or a Republican.,Surprised
545,Really since 1953? the other parties should really step up their game,Curious to dive deeper
545," Oh darn it, no I meant 1853, so it's been even longer! ",Happy
545," Oh that's surprising, maybe one day a president from one of the other parties will win. The last election was a joke I didn't like either of the candidates ",Curious to dive deeper
545,I guess every US president until recent that has had a beard is Republican.,Happy
545,Seems like you know a lot about the Republican party any cool facts about the democrats?,Curious to dive deeper
545,I'm not sure. I feel like I know more about Republicans. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
545," Not many, but 15% of the tea party movement identifies with the democratic party as well",Curious to dive deeper
545,I would never have guessed that at all. I like to look up information a lot on YouTube. It is so handy. I'm not surprised the search engine is the second largest.,Happy
545,Yeah the second largest after Google and its also owned by Google so there is a monopoly in that field.,Curious to dive deeper
545,I just can not believe that Google paid $1.65 billion for it!,Surprised
545," Sounds like a great deal, YouTube must be worth a lot more by now. Google bought the company back in 2006",Curious to dive deeper
545,I can not even imagine its value. Police share law enforcement videos on their own YouTube called Blue Tube.,Surprised
545," That sounds like a really useful service I bet all kind of cool videos are shown in there, kind of boring for the normal user though",Curious to dive deeper
545," I wonder. I imagine its for training, so probably yes. I've never been a registered user, so I can only view videos, I can not upload any videos on You Tube.",Neutral
545,Did you watch that video called Gangnam Style? that was a funny video,Curious to dive deeper
545," I did, but I never really got into the hype. I know it was really popular though.",Surprised
545," Yeah in fact they had to upgrade their count integer to 64 bits, it received more view than the site could handle at the time",Curious to dive deeper
545,I am shocked. I would think they would just take the video down.,Surprised
545," Well the video did make them a fortune so that was not a choice, anyways its been interesting chatting with you. ",Curious to dive deeper
545," Yes, it was nice. Have a good night.",Neutral
546,Do you like tennis ? The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days.,Surprised
546,Wow.  That's a long time. I haven't played since I was in college...and even then I stunk. lol  I much prefer table tennis which is also called ping pong.  lol,Happy
546,pIng pong is fun. did you know that a A black man won the 1st us open tennis title in 1968 and no black man has won it since,Surprised
546,I had no idea.  Maybe it was Arthur Ash?  I remember him from when I was a kid.  Up until 1978 a tennis player could use any object as a racket.  That would have been interesting to see what some might have used.,Happy
546,I was thinking Arthur Ash. I love the Polo shirts,Happy
546,I used too but am more of a tshirt guy now.  lol  Did you know that some consider grunting before a shot to be a form of cheating?,Happy
546,I never know that. I did know that They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 us open,Curious to dive deeper
546," That would have dried them fast.  Tennis generates good money, but not as much as soccer which makes more than all of the other big popular sports combined.",Happy
546,Roger Federer is a good player Federer has won 20 Grand Slam singles titles,Curious to dive deeper
546," Wow.  Since beginning his career in 1998, that has to make him one of the best of all time?  ",Happy
546,He has held the world No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings for a record total of 310 weeks,Curious to dive deeper
546,Holy smokes!  I wonder how much money he has made?  Novak Djokovic has more career earnings than Federer.,Happy
546,Wow. Its a good tennis doc on Netflix.,Happy
546,I love Netflix.  During Christmas we had the hour long fireplace video Netflix has on there on a loop at our house.,Happy
546,Wow. did you know that Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth,Surprised
546,That surprises me.  Who rents dvds through the mail anymore?,Happy
546,I thought that had went away years ago. lol. I know Blockbuster is mad for not accepting several offers to buy netflix for $50 million,Surprised
546,Me too!  lol  That wasn't too smart of a move for sure!,Happy
546,Netflix and youtube is taking up most of the the peak internet traffic,Neutral
546,I believe that.  People love videos.  Netflix employs a team of taggers who are paid to watch Netflix and tag the content.  What a job to have.,Happy
546,I would love to have it.,Happy
547," Hi, do you like tennis?",Curious to dive deeper
547,Not that much. If they still used a Helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts like they did in the 1969 open I would watch.,Surprised
547,What if they did that while they played? It would increase the degree of difficulty.. would you watch?,Curious to dive deeper
547,Haha that would be funny and kind of scary! The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days. That would bore me for sure.,Surprised
547,I remember that. It was a Jon Isner match in like wimbeldon. They had to stop due to the darkness and exhaustion.,Surprised
547,The Roger Federer of paddle tennis wasn't that great apparently because US Open quarterfinalist Gael Monfils beat him within days of learning how to play.,Surprised
547,Huh... No black man has won the us open since 1968 when arthur ashe won.,Surprised
547," Wow, wonder why. Federer has one 20 grand slam singles title, the most ever for a male player.",Surprised
547,Did you hear how he tore his meniscus?,Curious to dive deeper
547," I'm not sure, was it in a game?",Curious to dive deeper
547," No, he was drawing a bath for his daughter in 2016 and tore it. It was the worst injury of his career.",Happy
547," Whoops, how ironic! I wonder if it slowed him down much? Since 2000 he and a couple of other players have accounted for 56 percent of men's grand slam titles.",Surprised
547,I do not think so. He was gifted 2 cows though. What does one do with cows?,Surprised
547,EAT THEM! No? That is odd though. And he has also been honored with an official stamp.,Surprised
547,I am fine with eating them but who butchers them? Can you see him doing it?,Happy
547," Haha, no. I do wonder what he really did with them.",Curious to dive deeper
547,Did you see the match where he competed on half grass and half clay?,Happy
547,I didn't see that. That's so interesting. Wonder why they competed there and why the court was like that.,Curious to dive deeper
547," It was a challenge between he and nadal. Who was better, Roger on grass or nadal on clay...",Happy
547," Ohh, that sounds cool. I would watch that match, though I do prefer watching Netflix.",Happy
547,Me too... Nice chatting with you!,Happy
548,Do you have hope for Pelosi and the democrats in providing balance to the government at this all important time in history.,Curious to dive deeper
548,I am not very into politics. The modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson.,Neutral
548,Pelosi is the new Speaker of the House. She was not very welcomed in Florida a couple of months back when she was in Florida campaigning for the democrat candidate.,Neutral
548,Why not? Anything in particular?,Curious to dive deeper
548,She is just not well liked because of her brash personality I presume.,Neutral
548,I see. Did you know There hasn't been a us president who wasn't a republican or a democrat since 1853?,Neutral
548," No, but I would have ventured a similar guess. To add to your point, the colors of blue and red have been used to differentiate the parties since 2000",Neutral
548,I thought it was longer than that! Every us president with a beard has been a republican.,Surprised
548," Yeah, that was a weird fact. Another similar one would be the fact that Truman refused to be photographed on a ride at Disneyland.",Neutral
548,I heard it was because it was the dumbo ride and so he wouldn't be associated with republicans,Surprised
548,Silly.  We need another tough progressive like Teddy Roosevelt.,Neutral
548,The last time a republican was elected president without a nixon or bush on the ticket was 1928!,Surprised
548,That is quite some time. There are very few conservative democrats left in office.,Neutral
548," The GOP presently hold ""trifectas"" (the executive branch and both chambers of the legislative branch) in a majority of states (26/50), and a ""trifecta plus"" (executive, legislative, and judicial branches) at the federal level, as five of the nine current Supreme Court justices were appointed by Republican presidents.",Surprised
548,I think that might be higher with the confirmation of Kavanaugh recently.,Neutral
548,Likely! Here's a funny fact; Fox news threatened to sue the simpsons in order to stop them from parodying its famously anti-democratic party agenda.,Neutral
548,Sounds just like fox.  Do you know the republicans actually started out opposing slavery.,Curious to dive deeper

549," Yeah I find that weird too. Do you know Roger Federer, who he is?",Curious to dive deeper
549,I do know Rodger Federer. He's actually really awesome at tennis. I can't believe that one guy beat him after learning how to play tennis only a couple days earlier. In fact that is astounding to me,Surprised
549,Yeah that is cool. And he once competed with Nadal in a field half of which was clay,Curious to dive deeper
549,Wow I didn't know that. I guess he was also gifted two cows for winning some games. I can think of a lot better prizes personally haha,Surprised
549,And he is the only person in Switzerland that is honored with an official stamp,Curious to dive deeper

549,Yep I like how they started off being worth 50 million when Blockbuster was going to buy them. And now Netflix is worth about two billion dollars. That is so insane. I bet Blockbuster is super mad about that. Do you know if they are out of business already?,Surprised
549,Oh they are out of business alright. They could have made millions if they took that opportunity,Curious to dive deeper
549,LOL you're right. I kind of miss them though. I like going to the store to pick out movies. But the fees is what actually started Netflix in the first place LOL. It was a copy of Apollo 13,Surprised

550,That must have taken a lot of endurance to play.,Neutral

551," Yea, I like the horror films that have macabre and supernatural themes the most",Neutral
551,Apparently Stephen King thought Bambi was a horror movies.,Curious to dive deeper
551," I guess King was scared when Bambi's mother was killed, or doesn't like deers",Neutral
551," yeah, I can't remember the story to be honest. What about google, do you use it a lot? ",Curious to dive deeper
551," Yea, it's crazy a single google search using more computing power than the apollo moon missions",Surprised
551," Interesting, I didn't realize that. How does google calculate traffic? ",Curious to dive deeper
551," I guess it uses data from peoples phones to calculate traffic, that's pretty unsettling",Disgusted
551,That is pretty cool. Did you know they have goats cut their lawn?,Curious to dive deeper
551," I've heard that, you figure they would just use lawn mowers unless they were broke after they started in 1998",Surprised
551," Yeah, did you know when google went down for 5 minutes it took 40% of web traffic with it? ",Curious to dive deeper
551," Yea on august 16th of 2013, I wonder if I was trying to go on google that day",Neutral

551," No, I have heard of a cat that was a coauthor on a physicist study though",Neutral
551," Well the town of Talkeetna, Alaska has a cat that is the mayor. ",Curious to dive deeper
551,That's pretty cool even though when a cat turns 15 it has spent 10 years of its life sleeping,Neutral
551," That is hilarious, they must be well rested. I wonder why they sleep so much? ",Curious to dive deeper
551," I don't know, I wonder if feral cats sleep as much as house cats",Curious to dive deeper
551," I'm not sure, that would be interesting to find out. ",Curious to dive deeper
552,Do you like to play tennis?,Curious to dive deeper
552,I'm not sure. i never really gotten to play.  Do you?,Neutral
552," I do, Im really bad at it but I think its a great sport, it can be played among two people which is a great advantage. Do you like the sport?",Curious to dive deeper
552,I do like to watch some games.  It looks like it can be a lot of fun!  I've heard though that the longest match in history was 11 hours long and lasted over 3 days.  That i'm not so sure i would like.,Neutral
552," That is a really long game, they must have been exhausted and the fans bored out already. ",Surprised
552,Probably so.  But tennis is very competitive so the players though exhausted most likely kept fighting.,Neutral
552,Do you like polo shirts? cool fact about them but they were actually created by a tennis player,Curious to dive deeper
552,I do and I had no idea about that! I assumed polo players wore them and they became a fashion thing.,Neutral
552," They were invented by Rene The Crocodile Lacoste, it was adopted later by polo players but it seems they stole all the credit lol",Curious to dive deeper
552," Yep they did!  Hey, do you watch netflix?",Neutral
552," I do like to watch Netflix, a lot of interesting content for a small price. ",Curious to dive deeper
552,I agree.  It's weird to think that it started back in 1997 though.  I guess because it is focusing on streaming now it just seems like a newer company.,Neutral
552," Its worth $2 billion dollars by now, so yeah, I wonder if the service will be around much longer",Curious to dive deeper
552,Two billion dollars and to think it all started because Reed Hastings was mad about a forty dollar late fee on a vhs movie!,Neutral
552," Yeah a $40 late fee and the movie Apollo 13, I wonder if theres a tennis documentary on Netflix, maybe Roger Federer appears on it. ",Curious to dive deeper
552,I bet he does. He's ranked number 3 in the world currently and held the number 1 spot for a record total of 310 weeks.,Neutral

552," Oh and oddly enough, he's been gifted with two cows over his career!",Neutral
552," I'm guessing that's a lot of them? no idea about that, anyway its been great chatting with you. ",Curious to dive deeper
552,I don't know but he got them for winning the wimbledon in 2003 and the swiss open in 2013.  It's been great chatting with you too!  Have a great day!,Neutral

553,I love horror movies as well and yeah I dont see running for my life if I see bambi lol,Happy
553," So all this time i have been watching horror films , i have actually been burning calories. It is said that you can burn more than 180 calories. Wow. Must be because of the adrenaline pumping?",Happy
553," Im going to watch a bunch then lol, I heard that if you see abstract art before a horror movie you will enjoy it more. ",Happy
553," Thats cool. You know the movie the Shining? Well, the little boy Danny didnt even know he was acting in a film till way later, that was a good idea i think because the Shining is super scary",Curious to dive deeper
553," I know! I also craped my pants when I watched it, I thought it was pretty good and Danny sold the part. How can you not know its a horror movie though.",Surprised
553," He was so young so i guess he didnt see the scarier stuff. As i am thinking of horror , the movie Cats Eye came to mind. I love cats so i got the best of both in that movie..horror and cats..lol",Happy
553," I love cat too, I have one, I learn this fact lately that when it reaches 15 years of age they have span 10 of them sleeping.",Happy

553," Thats a cute name, and I didnt know that, thats an interesting fact I heard that a town in Alaska has a cat as its mayor.",Surprised
553," Lol. I bet if we used the search engine Google we could find lots of interesting facts and pictures of cats. Google has been around since 1998 and it we typed in ""cat"" that single google search requires a lot of computing power just like what sent men to the moon",Curious to dive deeper
553," I know, there are a lot of cool facts, like the cat that was in the opening scene in the godfather 1.",Surprised
553," Oh yes in the Godfather movie that cat was actually a stray they found. What about on the topic of horror movies again, that cat from Pet Sematary? Now that was a scary cat which wasnt valued for companionship any longer. Lol",Curious to dive deeper
553," Yeah, it was scary, I used google to get a better glance, I think google is a great company, has interesting apps.",Curious to dive deeper
553,Yes Google is amazing.  You know Google is so popular that in 2013 when Google went down for 5 minutes it took 40 % of the web traffic with it !,Curious to dive deeper
553," That crazy, we depend on google a whole bunch, 40% is a lot of users.",Curious to dive deeper
553," Yes we rely on Google not only for a search engine but for cloud computing, software, hardware, maps and online advertising. i am sure the creator Larry Oage and SErgey ",Neutral
553," I must have at least 5 google apps on my phone, did you know that google maps calculates traffic using android devices.",Surprised
553,yes i use google maps all the time. I love Google its americas top search engine and i really love the other two topics of the horror movie and cats. Its interesting to me to be able to talk with you about all 3. i will be googling some more scary movies later with cats in them. lol.,Curious to dive deeper
553," I think I will do that as well lol, in going to use google to browse for a horror movie and usually they have cats in them. ",Happy
554," Hi there!  Do you follow or enjoy tennis at all?  I play it a lot more than I follow it, but I do know that Roger Federer has the most Grand Slam titles in history!",Happy
554," I do, Juan Martin del Potro is one of my favorite players, do you know who he is? and Federer is a great player as well I really like him",Curious to dive deeper
554,I do not know much about Juan Martin del Potro.  I do know that he is Argentinian and a former US Open champion.,Neutral
554," His a great player  he has played against Federer a couple of times, he was the champion back in 2009 as well",Curious to dive deeper
554,He is a good example of determination.  I know he had some struggles with wrist injuries and had to have a lot of surgeries.  To reach the pinnacle of the game after that is incredible!,Happy
554," Its been hard, 4 surgeries can really make you quite, but I guess it paid off and with hard work he was able to make it, Rafael Nadal also had a new injury",Curious to dive deeper
554," Nadal is a great player too.  Crazy to think that 56% of grand slam titles have gone to him, Djokovic, or Federer since 2000.",Surprised
554," Really talented players, legends of the game, Federer is the first person in Switzerland to be honored with a official stamp",Curious to dive deeper
554,That is great.  He has held the #1 spot in the ATP rankings for 310 weeks!  That is Tiger Woods type stuff!,Happy
554," Yeah definitely, a low point in his career was 2016, he suffered a big injury then",Curious to dive deeper
554," Yes, while bathing his daughters of all things.  Crazy!",Surprised
554," Really? I thought it was during a match, tough way of getting injured",Surprised
554," Yea, no kidding.  Tennis players are usually in such good shape too.  The longest match ever went on for 11 hours over the course of 3 days!",Surprised
554,11 hours and 3 days wow!! both players could get injured in the way,Curious to dive deeper
554," Yea, you would think that is borderline dangerous!",Fearful
554," That shouldnt be allowed anyways, do you know the tennis player Gael Memphis?",Curious to dive deeper
554,I have heard a story of him beating the best paddle player in the world after just learning how to play.  Is that true?,Curious to dive deeper
554," First time hearing about it, if its true then its really amazing",Surprised
554,That is remarkable.  The sport used to be a lot more influential than it is today.  I recently learned polo shirts were originally invented specifically for tennis!,Surprised
554," Thats a new one, who invented them do you know?",Curious to dive deeper
554," Rene ""the crocodile"" Lacoste!  What a name!",Happy
554," Probably the creator of the Lacoste brand, either way his contribution is great I love to wear polo shirts. ",Curious to dive deeper
555,Hello - how are you today?,Curious to dive deeper
555," I'm doing pretty good, how about yourself?",Curious to dive deeper
555,I'm doing good too. Do you like horror films?,Curious to dive deeper
555," I do, I need to watch a marathon today. They say that watching horror movies can burn up more than 180 calories!",Curious to dive deeper
555," Haha that's funny! If you watch a horror movie before you look at abstract art, you will enjoy the art more apparently.",Surprised
555,That's interesting. Did you know Danny from The Shining did not know he was acting in a horror film until several years later.,Surprised
555,Oh wow I didn't know that. Pretty interesting he didn't know.,Surprised
555," I've always wondered if they tell young kids what kind of movie they're in while filming. Did you know that Stephen King was terrified when he saw ""Bambi"" as a child?",Surprised
555,I saw that - pretty funny he was scared of Bambi. Do you use Google?,Curious to dive deeper
555," I do, it's like my best friend. I ask it everything. ",Neutral
555,Haha same here. A single Google search requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts to the moon.,Surprised
555,That's crazy how far technology has came. I heard that Google maps calculates traffic by tracking how fast Android devices are moving on the road.,Curious to dive deeper
555,Wow that's amazing. Google maps will tailor its maps whenever there is a disputed border.,Surprised
555,That's pretty neat. I wish I worked at their headquarters. Instead of hiring people to mow the lawns they once used hundred of live goats. I would have been playing with the goats all day. Haha,Surprised
555,Haha that would be fun. Do you like cats?,Curious to dive deeper
555," I tolerate cats is more like it. I have a Maine Coon that is a barn cat that is a terror. She's only nice at feeding time. She's almost 15, and they say that once cats reach that age it has usually spent 10 years of it's life sleeping. I'm not so sure about her though.",Curious to dive deeper
555,That's cool. I can't have any animals with fur because my wife is allergic to them.,Surprised
555," Bummer, maybe you could go to a cat cafe in Japan or Taiwan. You can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks.",Curious to dive deeper
555,That would be kinda fun to do. The cat in Godfather part 1 was actually a stray.,Surprised
555,That's cool. I wonder if it got a good home after the filming? There's a town in Alaska called Talkeetna that has had a cat named Stubbs as it's mayor since 1997.,Surprised
555,It was great talking to you!,Happy
556," Hi there, do you watch video on YouTube?",Curious to dive deeper
556," Occasionally. I like to play Bob Ross' Joy of Painting for my dogs while I'm at work, and YouTube has full episodes of it.",Happy
556,Yeah I like him too. You Tube is the second largets search engine nowadays,Curious to dive deeper
556," I'm not surprise. At one point, it consumed as much bandwidth as the entire internet in 2000.",Neutral
556,Yeah that is crazy. Bieber's Baby song seems to be the most disliked video in there. Poor guy,Curious to dive deeper
556," I don't feel as badly for him as I do for the three guys who created YouTube. Evidently, Google bought it for only 1.65 billion dollars over a decade ago. I feel like it's probably worth way more now!",Surprised
556,I bet it is for sure. Have you heard of Bluetube?,Curious to dive deeper
556,I haven't. What is BlueTube?,Curious to dive deeper
556,It is a police YouTube and you can check out law enforcement videos in it,Curious to dive deeper
556," That's pretty cool. I remember when YouTube was completely free, and was mostly cute animals.",Neutral
556,Yeah the good times. Did you know they had to increase the video view after Gangnam Style came out?,Curious to dive deeper
556,That's crazy. I wonder how many views the very first upload has by new. That one with the guy talking about an elephant.,Neutral
556," Yeah I wonder about that too. On another topic, do you follow politics much?",Curious to dive deeper
556,I do. I love politics. There are a lot of fun facts about the government I find fascinating. Like the congressional baseball game that has been going on for over a hundred years? They should televise that!,Neutral
556,I would love to see that. Did you know Truman refused to be photographed on the dumbo ride?,Curious to dive deeper
556," Haha, yeah. He didn't want to be associated with the Republican party. I guess Hillary didn't, either, since she used to be the President of the Young Republicans club in school.",Neutral
556," THat is such a huge change for her, wow. Did you know every republican president has had a beard?",Curious to dive deeper
556," Yeah, Hillary wasn't the only one to change her mind; Reagan was originally a Democrat! I don't think Donald Trump has a beard, but I think every president who has had a beard was a Republican. ",Neutral
556," Yeah I was thinking about that, maybe he decided to change that. The colors blue and red were adopted by both parties only stated in 2000 I did not know that. ",Curious to dive deeper
556,That's pretty funny. I wonder if it's because that was when internet and the spread of information really took off? There needed to be more branding to differentiate.,Neutral
556," I guess so, that is actually a really good point. Nice chatting with you.",Curious to dive deeper
557,Do you like tennis?,Curious to dive deeper
557," I do like tennis, do you?",Curious to dive deeper
557,I like it as well Juan Martin del Potro is one of my favorite players glad he too the U.S. Open home,Happy
557,Isn't he from Argentina?,Curious to dive deeper
557," He is from Argentina, his hometown is called Tandil",Curious to dive deeper
557,I love how he treats his friends and has their backs. I would want to live like that.,Happy
557," I agree thats a great trait to have, he is 29 years old and I think this is the first time winning a US Open, his had a lot of skilled oponents over the years",Curious to dive deeper
557,did you know the polo shirt was invented by a tennis player?,Surprised
557," No didnt know that, I guess tennis players also used polo players to play",Curious to dive deeper
557," I guess it was invented by Rene ""the crocodile"" Lacoste. Hence the name of the brand and crocodile shirt.",Surprised
557," Interesting, Lacoste is a brand that I like a lot, do you know how long the longest game on tennis history lasted?",Curious to dive deeper
557," I do not, how long? ",Curious to dive deeper
557,it lasted over 3 days!!! thats a really long time,Curious to dive deeper
557,I bet Jon Isner was involved. That guy plays the longest matches. Do you like Federer?,Curious to dive deeper
557," Yeah Federer is another one of my favorites, the Swiss pro player",Curious to dive deeper
557,Did you see that he tore a meniscus when he stretched too far while drawing a bath for his daughter? What a freak accident!,Surprised
557," That is a harsh way to get injured, it was one of the worse injuries in his career in fact",Curious to dive deeper
557,At least he has the honor of being the first living person in switzerland to be honored with a stamp.,Happy
557," Yeah, and has also won many ATPS, US Opens and about every tennis comptetition out there",Curious to dive deeper
557,He has been gifted two cows too! I mean what the heck is he going to do with 2 cows?,Happy
557," 2 cows really? what does that have to do with Tennis lol, hopefully we will see his life in a documentary in Netflix one day",Curious to dive deeper
557," Yeah, that would be an interesting watch. It was great chatting with you!",Happy
558," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
558,I'm doing great! How are you doing tonight?,Neutral
558," I am doing well, thanks! Do you like tennis?",Curious to dive deeper
558,I don't really know the sport well. I know that it can earn some people lots of money.,Neutral
558," Well, let me inform you! They once used a helicopter to dry the grass for the 69 us open!",Happy
558," A helicopter? Well, I guess rich folk have all kind of resources at their disposal. Never needed to do that again, I guess.",Neutral
558,I would have just had to tried to blow it dry with my breath. Would have taken forever!,Happy
558," They know how to think big in tennis, that's for sure. The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days. I wonder if anyone watched the whole thing.",Neutral
558,They would have been sleepy after! Like I am after binge watching some netflix.,Happy
558,Netflix has fostered so much binge watching. People spend weekends immobile because of Netflix.,Neutral
558,I know! hey have 137 million subscribers worldwide! THat's crazy!,Surprised
558," The cash flow must be solid. They are expanding all the time, but still pay a lot in postage. I wonder why.",Neutral
558,I wondered that too! They do make up half of internet traffic along with youtube!,Surprised
558," That's intense. People love video. The origins of the company are funny, though.",Neutral
558,What is the origin?,Curious to dive deeper
558," After racking up a $40 late fee on a vhs copy of apollo 13, reed hastings was inspired to start Netflix. Reed got angry, and started a new company that put Blockbuster out of business.",Neutral
558,What a dumb and inefficient way to make $40! That came back to bit them in the rear!,Surprised
558,Yes. Blockbuster underestimated the value of Netflix too.,Neutral
558,Yeah! They were off by quite a bit. Like $2B!,Surprised
558,I think BB imagined that they could copy Netflix easily. It's sometimes simpler just to buy a turnkey operation.,Neutral
558,Good point! Nice chatting with you!,Happy
559,Hi how are you?!,Curious to dive deeper
559,I'm good!  Do you like animals?,Curious to dive deeper
559,I do! did you know there are 20 quintillion animals on earth?,Surprised
559,Wow.  I didn't know there was that many.  It's estimated that over 1.5 million living animal species have been described.,Happy
559,That is a lot. What is your favorite animal?,Curious to dive deeper
559,Hahah my favorite animals are frogs.  Been fascinated with them ever since I was a kid for some reason.,Happy
559,Interesting! Did you know under provisions of the 1912 Scottish protection of animals act the lochness monster is a protected species? hahaha,Surprised
559,That's funny!  The Netherlands is constructing special bridges for wildlife in order to connect habitats and keep animals from being hit by cars.  That's a good idea.  In the fall where I live the roads are peppered with dead animals.  I think they try to get on the roads to get warm at night and that's when they get hit.,Curious to dive deeper
559," Intriguing! Crazy that humans have lost their body hair 240,000 years ago.",Neutral
559,Interesting. lol  There's a lawyer in Switzerland who represents animals in court.  That's a different kind of lawyer job.,Happy
559,So weird. I would sue humans if I were an animal.,Surprised
559,lol  yes.  They sure have gotten the short end of the stick that's for sure.  Do you like horses?  I had them while growing up.,Happy
559,I love horses. Never had one. I heard humans domesticated horses around 4000 bc.,Neutral
559,I believe it.  95 percent of all modern thoroughbred racehorses can trace their Y chomosome to one horse named Darley Arabian.,Happy
559,Interesting! Did you know Clint Eastwood was allergic to horses?,Neutral
559,lol No.  That's interesting since he starred in so many Western movies!,Happy
559,Seriously. Hopefully he got over that allergy by now.,Neutral
559," Yes.  I'm not sure.  Did you know that horses, sharks, and orangutans are all ticklish?  lol",Happy
559,That is funny. I also did not know that germany became the first country to universally give animals constitionally legal rights.,Surprised
559,I didn't know that either!  The length of a horse hair is strongly related to the amount of sunlight it gets. Interesting.,Happy
559," Interesting, I had no idea.",Curious to dive deeper
559," I didn't either.  I also just learned that once an Icelandic horse leaves Iceland, it can never come back.  I had a good time chatting with you!",Happy
560,Are you a fan of horses?,Curious to dive deeper
560,I like them. I know dalmatians are associated with fire departments because they would calm the horses,Happy
560," Interesting, I didn't know that. Did you know that Icelandic horses have a fifth speed? ",Curious to dive deeper
560,Really! Do you know why they have it?,Happy
560," I think it is a speedwalk, but I'm not really sure. ",Curious to dive deeper
560,Oh cool! Did you know that even though Clint Eastwood was featured on horses for many of his movies he actually had a mid-life allergy to them?,Surprised
560," Interesting, I wonder if he takes medicines during the scenes. ",Curious to dive deeper
560," I would think so! It is crazy how human's work, isn't it? ",Curious to dive deeper
560," Yeah, it is. Apparently they lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago. ",Curious to dive deeper
560,And yet we still have some. Humans' adaptation for persistence hunting makes them among the best distance runners among all running animals.,Happy
560,It is pretty weird. Did you know that we will grow a rib in only 2-3 months?,Curious to dive deeper
560,No kidding! I had no idea humans could regenerate ribs.,Surprised
560,Interesting isn't it. Did you know there is a frequency that causes fear?,Curious to dive deeper
560," No, I did not. Did you know that almost all h=animals and plants can synthesize their own vitamin c but humans can't because their gene for this enzyme is defective.",Surprised
560,Did you know that there are 20 quintillion animals on the earth?,Curious to dive deeper
560,Holy cow! That's a lot. I have heard that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated.,Surprised
560," Interesting, is this all animals? ",Curious to dive deeper
560,I believe so. Hard to believe but the Loch Ness Monster is a protected species under provisions of a 1912 Scottish protection of animals.,Happy
560,I can believe it. Is it also a national mascot?,Curious to dive deeper
560," That's a good question, but I do not know the answer.",Happy
560,Did you know that hiccups are a holdover from when land animals had gills and lungs?,Curious to dive deeper
560,I have never heard that before! Crazy.,Happy
560," Yeah, it is. Nice chatting with you. ",Curious to dive deeper
561," I like Walt Disney, how about you.",Curious to dive deeper
561,Yes I like Walt Disney a lot. Did you hear about the Lion King remake that they're coming out with though? Is it live action or not?,Curious to dive deeper
561," I was a big Lion King fan, have you seen it?",Curious to dive deeper
561,No they haven't come out with the Remake yet. But I did see the stage show and I also saw a movie which are both great. Julie Taymor directed the Broadway musical by the way,Happy
561," They made it dubbed in zulu for african release, that was nice of them",Curious to dive deeper
561," Yes I agree. I also like how revolutionary Disney was with their use of multi-plane cameras, that really adds to an animated scene and they used it in Bambi",Happy
561," For sure, it is amazing what they can do. Frozen was a good song, ever seen it?",Curious to dive deeper
561,Yes I did like that movie. I think it was the first Disney movie to be directed by a woman.,Curious to dive deeper
561," For sure, that is a good stat. They need more women directing disney movies ",Curious to dive deeper
561," Yes I think so. What do you think about the movie Big Hero 6? That was actually decent, it's not my favorite but it is impressive they used a 50,000 core computer to render it",Surprised
561," Wow, I did not know. I liked that movie and it makes sense.",Curious to dive deeper
561,Did you ever see the movie Up by the way? Apparently it would take 9 million balloons to actually lift the house LOL that's insane,Surprised
561," Lol, that would be so many balloons, and so much helium! People would be talking funny for days if they all popped.",Curious to dive deeper
561,Haha that's a good point. Do you think anyone has ever attached so many balloons to themselves that they floated away LOL,Curious to dive deeper
561,For sure! Do you have a favorite animal?,Curious to dive deeper
561,Yes my favorite animal is the dog! Dogs are so awesome and that they love humans makes me happy haha what about you,Curious to dive deeper
561,Me too. I love dogs so much! There are 20 quintillion animals on planet earth. So many!,Curious to dive deeper
561,That is a lot! What school is that you know how humans have a dominant side like you're right-handed or whatever? Apparently dogs have a dominant paw side too LOL,Happy
561," Just like humans, that is awesome. Good chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
561," Yes you as well, make sure to check your dog for a distinct dialect though, apparently depending on where animals are from they will sound different",Surprised
561," for sure, bye!",Curious to dive deeper
562," hello, I love horses. One of my fav are the icelandic horses. They go very fast. ",Happy
562," Hello, I love horses also. I like how the get along with the Dalmatians that are with firefighters that protect them.",Neutral
562,There was a fire here in LA and so many horse were saved by out firefighters. Any other animals were not very lucky. It was very sad. We need to do more to protect animals,Sad
562,oh wow. Here in Iowa we don't really see fires like that. But I agree we do need to protect animals,Happy
562,There are so many different kinds of animals in the world. many are going way too. We need to be more like Germany. Have you head of what they are doing?,Happy
562,I have not really heard about what they are doing,Curious to dive deeper
562,they are projecting the rights of animals by giving them constitutional rights,Surprised
562,that is a really good idea more counties should have that,Neutral
562,yeah very cool right! We humans come from animals basically. Would you agree?,Curious to dive deeper
562,I would agree,Neutral
562,We have so much of the same DNA and how we used to have so much hair back in the day like over 200000 years ago. That's crazy!,Happy
562,I can't it been that long,Neutral
562,could be. Probably is goes all the way back to Africa I've recently learned. We are basically African animals at one point lol,Curious to dive deeper
562,I can see that. We sure have come along way since then,Neutral
562,or not lol..... I randomly learned sound can cause fear in humans. That's pretty wild,Curious to dive deeper
562,I believe that. I know there are some sounds that cause me fear,Neutral
562,I wonder how that happens. ANy guesses?,Curious to dive deeper
562,It's got to be something in the sound frequency,Neutral
562,Yea I'm just wondering what is in that which activates a fear in our human emotion. I wonder if we get that from animals??,Surprised
562,We could have I am sure there are certain sound that cause them to fear,Neutral
562,totally. Interesting conversation,Happy
563," hi,  do you like animals?  did you know the loch ness monster is a protected species? ",Surprised
563," I did not know that. That will come in handy once we find one. Also,Germany was the first country in the world to universally give animals legal rights that were constitutionally guaranteed. This was in 2002.",Surprised
563," Sweet!  hmmm domesticated animals develop a white patch,  I wonder if that is only towards horses or all animals. ",Surprised
563," Yeah, I wonder if that occurs naturally or because of how they are bred.",Curious to dive deeper
563,Maybe.  I know Orcas dorsal fin tends to flop over in captivity but it the wild the dorsal fin it straight up.,Surprised
563," Interesting. There are so many things to learn about animals, especially knowing that there are 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.",Surprised
563,i wonder how many zeroes are in a quintillion lol That is a lot of animals!  i love the discovery channel I watch a lot of animal shows.   Did you know theres a breed of horse that has a fifth speed?  I guess it is called a tolt.,Surprised
563,I heard a tolt is speedwalking for a horse. That's pretty funny!,Happy
563," That is cool,  horses got places to go!  speed walking is helpful. ",Surprised
563,I can't imagine being allergic to horses. I would be devastated. Apparently Clint Eastwood developed an allergy to them although he has been on horseback in many of his movies.,Surprised
563," Yeah I know right,  hes in so many western movies,  I guess he had to take daily claritin for his allergies!  ",Surprised
563," Haha. I am glad we get to use horses for leisure these days or for recording movies, haha. Historically they were used in warfare.",Happy
563,did you hear about the lipizzaner horses?  They are born a dark color and later turn white?  Thats amazing!,Surprised
563," That's totally weird. I had not heard about that. Horses are great runners, but apparently we are the best distance runners.",Surprised
563,Maybe because we train with the knowledge we have to run far.  Animals just run for fun or because they have to.,Surprised
563," Well, that makes sense. We also cannot synthesize vitamin c like plants or animals.",Surprised
563," Damn defective gene.  Its ok,  forces us to get out in the sun!  ",Neutral
563," And drink lots of lemonade, yum. Haha.",Surprised
563," Yes,  so refreshing!  ",Happy
563,PETA feels strongly about animals and says their treatment is a social justice issue. We keep learning how intelligent and sensitive animals are and so it kind of is but sometimes they can go too far.,Curious to dive deeper
563,Yeah I feel very strongly about animals too.,Surprised
563,It's good that PETA teaches people to be kind of animals.,Happy
564," Hi, do you like animals?",Curious to dive deeper
564,I do like them cant believe there are 20 quintillion animals out there,Surprised
564,I was surprised that a white patch develops when animals are domesticated. Maybe that's why married men go grey...,Happy
564," Thats funny, that would make sense, animals have constitutional rights in Germany",Curious to dive deeper
564,Did you know that hiccups are an early evolution from land animals.,Surprised
564," I guess we are all animals and another fact that supports evolution, ",Curious to dive deeper
564,Did you hit enter prematurely?!?!? I do that more than I would like to admit. I wonder what the loch ness monster evolved from.,Happy
564," I did, I hate it when that happens, and I have no idea, good thing Nessie is a protected species. Since 1912 at least.",Curious to dive deeper
564,How long do loch ness monsters live for? How many are there? I have questions! I do not need answers though. I would like to know more about a sound frequency that causes fear in humans. I have enemies I need to vanquish!,Happy
564," Well Nessie is a myth, hopefully one day we can find out if the myth is true or not, and thats sounds interesting didnt know there was a fear frequency for humans.",Curious to dive deeper
564," Me either. Did you know we may have lost all of our body hair as recently as 240000 years ago? As a swimmer, I still see a lot of hairy humans!",Happy
564," I guess many of them didnt lose it lol, there are some hairy humans out there I agree with you",Curious to dive deeper
564,Did you know ribs grew back? That's crazy! How come other bones don't grow back? I broke my arm and that didn't grow back.,Surprised
564," I didnt know that, how long does it take for them to grow back? and that sounds painful",Curious to dive deeper
564,I wonder if they regrow in other animals like horses?,Happy
564," Not sure about that, but that is an intersting question do you like horses?",Curious to dive deeper
564,I do like horses but I am a little afraid of them. Do you like them?,Curious to dive deeper
564," I do, specially Icelandic horses, unique species with a fifth speed",Curious to dive deeper
564," Is that a speedwalking speed? I only have 2 speeds, slow and nothing.",Happy
564," Yeah thats speedwalking for a horse, Clint Eastwood is alergic to horses, I guess he doesnt like them that much",Curious to dive deeper
564,They do have big scary teeth. Nice chatting with you!,Happy
565," Hi, how are you?",Happy
565,Fine. What about you ?,Curious to dive deeper
565," I'm good, thanks for asking.  Do you like horses?",Curious to dive deeper
565,Yes. Horses species are evolved over 40 to 55 million years ago. Human domesticated horses for many purpose like travelling and carrying goods.,Curious to dive deeper
565,I like horses too!  I hear that the only true wild horses are the Przewalski's horse.  Did you know that?,Curious to dive deeper
565," Its very interesting. Horses mainly used in riding, agriculture and competition purpose. In olden days it is used in warfare and travelling. It speedy escaped from its predators.",Happy
565," Yes, I agree with you about that!  On a side note, do you know that there are about 20 quintillion animals on planet Earth?",Curious to dive deeper
565," Iceland horses have fifth speed, they are basically speed walking horses it very difficult to run in ice.",Happy
565," That's funny, I've seen those little horses and they are too cute!",Happy
565," They are pony. When they are big use it for riding. Lipizzaner horses, known for their classical performances.",Happy
565," Speaking of the Lipizzaner horses, did you know it takes about 6 years for them to turn white?  They are either born totally brown or black.",Curious to dive deeper
565," Now days, cops are using horses it is very amazing to see it.",Curious to dive deeper
565," Yes, it is. I read that there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans.",Surprised
565,Germany became first country in the world to constitutionally guaranteed legal rights.,Happy
565," That's right.  Did you know under the 1912 Scottish protection of animals act, The Loch Ness monster is a protected species?",Curious to dive deeper
565,If destroy any species can cause the breaking in the food web. It affect the eco-system very much so only the government take steps to protect them. we should also try to protect it.,Happy
565," Yes, we all have a responsibility to help keep the animals safe.",Happy
565,We should plant trees also it provide space for birds also.,Curious to dive deeper
565," So true, my friend!  It has been estimated that there are over 7 million different animal species on Earth!",Surprised
565,Very interesting. The study of animals is called zoology. It is used to deal with animal disease also.,Curious to dive deeper
565," You're correct.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you this morning. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day!",Happy
566,Did you know animals are multicellular ekaryotic organisms?,Curious to dive deeper
566," No didnt know that, but there are 20 quintillion of them in our planet",Curious to dive deeper
566,Really there are over 1.5 million living animal species that have been documented.  And animals develop white patches on their head when they are domesticated.,Curious to dive deeper
566," Thats a cool fact I wonder why, my dog doesnt have that patch, I might have to look at him closer, incredible how evolution acted on us, on species",Curious to dive deeper
566,Yea it is interesting I wonder why we dont have it as well as I feel like we have basically domesticated ourselves.,Curious to dive deeper
566,Thats a valid point did you hear about the Loch Ness Monster and his status as a protected species,Curious to dive deeper
566," Yea it's really strange.  It's really sad to think that so many horses died in war, so much more than humans.  War is so cruel.",Curious to dive deeper
566," It was a cruel war for horses, many, I hear Islandic horses have a fifth speed, ",Sad
566,That is interesting.  Horses were a powerful force in shaping our history.  We harnessed their power to change the world.,Curious to dive deeper
566," They were the tool to our rise in power, did you ever watch Clint Eastwood movies? he appaers in horses in fome of them, apparently his alergic to them",Curious to dive deeper
566,I have watched some.  He makes good movies.  Have you ever ridden a horse before? It is quite difficult.,Curious to dive deeper
566," No, never had the chance, but it must be difficult and scary at first, Dalmatians calm and protect horses, I love dogs",Happy
566,Dogs are important to us too.  Did you know two students rode theire horses to school and got suspended?,Curious to dive deeper
566," Thats funny I did hear about that story, A on creativity and A+ on the prank, ",Curious to dive deeper
566,Did you know homo sapies came from Africa?,Curious to dive deeper
566," No I didnt know that, as humans we began to show evidence of behavioral moderrnity around 50,000 years ago",Curious to dive deeper
566,Did you know hickups are leftover evolutionary behavior from when early lands animals had gills and lungs.,Curious to dive deeper
566," No I didnt know that humans are an interesting specie, we can regrow ribs in just 2-3 months and they will be as strong as the original ones",Curious to dive deeper
566,Wait we can regrow whole ribs?,Curious to dive deeper
566," Yeah we can, in just 2 to 3 months, ribs that have been surgically shortened",Curious to dive deeper
566,That is interesting.,Curious to dive deeper
567,What do you think of remakes of movies and cartoons?,Curious to dive deeper
567,I enjoy remakes if they are done well.,Curious to dive deeper
567,I think Disney is planning to remake the Lion King.  Disney released the first trailer for next year for the Lion King remake.,Curious to dive deeper
567,That's correct. Disney is calling the new Lion King remake a live action film but it relies almost exclusively on CGI so a lot of people consider it annimation.,Neutral
567," I do too. A related debate arose when Avatar was released, with the Visual Effects Society honoring James Cameron's 2009 epic for, among other trophies, animated character in a live-action feature motion picture",Curious to dive deeper
567,I agree that these kinds of films are skirting the line between traditional annimation and heavily CGI assisted live action films. With the improvements in the technology I'm not sure it makes sense anymore to feel the need to classify such films in the traditional modes.,Happy
567," Yeah I feel the same way of course Jon Favreau, the director of the Lion King remake has naturally walked down this valley before, with his update of The Jungle Book. ",Curious to dive deeper
567," Yes, the difference being that the Jungle Book still had a human character and therefore a true live action person was seen on screen. The Lion King contains no humans and so it is likely that everything is CGI.",Neutral
567," Technology is all consuming. During the 70s, disney recycled a lot of their animation frames, resulting in identical scenes in some movies",Curious to dive deeper
567," That was a different time, generating those frames took so long that it made sense to recycle those that you could. Creation is a much quicker process now with the aid of computer programs.",Neutral
567,Did you know that Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman.,Curious to dive deeper
567,Yes I had heard that. Disney does a good job trying to increase representation in their films and parks when possible. They also dubbed the Lion King into Zulu for its African release.,Happy
567,Makes sense i wasnt at all surprised when Disney acquired Marvel.,Curious to dive deeper
567,I was. Disney has made some major moves lately but acquiring the much more adult properies of Marvel Studios was a bold move to me.,Surprised
567,Yeah Bold but incredible lucrative. They certainly have their eye on the future.,Curious to dive deeper
567,True. They will make a lot of money off the films but even more in merchandise. They are also adding a Marvel Land to Disneys California Adventure that will be a big money maker for them.,Happy
567,Yeah i considerate a smart but gutsy play as you said. On another note did you know that Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total,Curious to dive deeper
567,That's hard to imagine so many unknown species. I wonder where the estimate comes from.,Curious to dive deeper
567," Speaking of animals In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights.",Curious to dive deeper
567,I think that is much needed. All countries should honor and respect animal rights. Scotland has declared the Loch Ness monster a protected species.,Curious to dive deeper
567,I agree i just hate it when animal lives some how trump human ones. nice talking to you,Curious to dive deeper
567,I'm not sure I've seen many situations where that occurs. It was nice talking to you as well.,Neutral
567,Last bit of info about animals is there are about 20 Quintilian individual animals on planet earth.,Curious to dive deeper
567,Interesting. Hope you have a good rest of your day!,Neutral
568,Do you often use the computer?,Neutral
568,Yes i do!,Neutral
568,It is amazing how far computers have come and how much a difference computers make for a device that simply carries out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations,Neutral
568," yeah, i so agree!   And with all that technology, Google built their first computer with the housing being made out of legos.",Happy
568,Computers can be made of anything. Russians made a computer that ran on water and someone built a working 16bit computer using nothing but basic minecraft building blocks!,Surprised
568,Yep... and Disney definitely takes advantage of the computer making CGI movies,Happy
568,Indeed. Hollywood too have been remaking beloved classics with new CGI technology and overall better technology thanks to computers,Neutral
568,and we definitely benefit from it all as consumers!,Happy
568,I am looking forward to the disney lion king's remake of the 1994 classic,Neutral
568,yeah me too... but i am classic kind of person though!  should be interesting seeing it done in cgi though!,Happy
568,What do you think of live action remakes?,Neutral
568,They are ok... like i said... much prefer the old school classics!,Curious to dive deeper
568,I wonder if that is because that is what we grew up with and are nostalgic or if they are simply better in quality?,Neutral
568,yeah I am sure... I think the computer kind of takes away from the true art form,Fearful
568,Who knows? Maybe one day we will reach a point were there won't be any distinction between films that rely on CGI painted performance and animated filmed that rely on photorealistic effects,Neutral
568,That is scary.... human action will never truly be replaced!,Surprised
568,Well transhumanists want to upload their minds into computers,Neutral
568," That's just weird... but the way computers are going, it will definitely happen.",Surprised
568,I agree that the future is limitless. In any case thank you for the enjoyable chat. Who know maybe in the future our minds will be in these computers?,Neutral
568,well computers keep getting better,Surprised
568,I concur. I hope you have a wonderful day.,Neutral
569," Did You know that humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago ?",Surprised
569," I think that fact is misleading. After all, we still have plenty of body hair today. I think it would be more accurate to say humans lost their fur (a consistent/extensive hair covering) within the last 240,000 years ago.",Curious to dive deeper
569,wow ;) we had fur ? ;),Curious to dive deeper
569,What do you think animal hair is? That's why I find wearing actual animal fur so disgusting. I wouldn't wear the skin and hair of another human. Why would I want to wear the skin of an animal?,Disgusted
569," no, what I meant was - did WE - humans had fur in the past ?",Curious to dive deeper
569," Well, yes. Technically we still have fur today (although it is spotty). Fur is the covering of hair used to protect an animal and help it control its temperature and reactions to the climate.",Neutral
569,ok... I've never thought about it this way...,Neutral
569," I think once you adjust your mindset and realize how close we are to modern-day animals, you begin to change how you think of the animals themselves.",Neutral
569,We are modern days animals ? how so... we just sit all day and look at the monitor :),Surprised
569," We're not just modern-day animals. We ARE animals. Homo sapiens are part of Hominina, which is a subtribe of Animalia (how we classify animals).",Neutral
569," Well at least from a name , ok, but we are logical, spiritual and very intelligent... I don't know if one can call us animals :)",Surprised
569," I disagree. I think animals are also very logical and intelligent. If you think about it, they are smarter than us. Humans are responsible for destroying the planet - and not only are we aware of that, we are consciously choosing to continue!",Angry
569,...but the fact that we are self-aware should make us something more than animals...,Curious to dive deeper
569,Animals are very much self-aware. They can plan for the future and cater their reactions to their environments. That is why you see so much of the animal kingdom continuing to thrive in the face of human interference.,Neutral
569," Interesting... but You can't really say they are smarter than us ;) we may be more evil, but we are still smarter :)",Surprised
569," What do you think qualifies (or rather, quantifies) our intelligence?",Curious to dive deeper
569,what do You mean ? No other animal can understand math on level we can...,Surprised
569," What do we use math to understand? Quantity and calculations? How do you think animals know how much food to store for winter, or which directions to migrate, or how to account for tides when navigating in the ocean?",Neutral
569," sure they are not stupid, but they won't build a computer processor...",Curious to dive deeper
569," Why do they need a computer processor? Animals have survived and thrived without electricity or any of the modern conveniences humans consider ""essential"" to our survival. I think the real sign of intelligence is the ability to not only survive but thrive in the face of challenges, and animals (excluding homo sapiens) have not only succeeded but excelled in doing so - all without damaging the Earth/locations for other species.",Curious to dive deeper
569," we don't talk about what they need or not, but about a fact they won't be able to build one because they don't understand high level calculations....",Curious to dive deeper
569," Why build what you don't need? Perhaps they have their own versions of technology. I don't think you can quantify or even compare human ""intelligence"" to that of the rest of the animal kingdom.",Neutral
570,Do you like horror films?,Curious to dive deeper
570," Not crazy about them unless they're real good like Steven King's Misery, but I think that's more thriller.",Neutral
570,Probably!  You see  the first horror film that stephen king saw?,Curious to dive deeper
570,Yes lol.  bambi  funny.  Far cry from what he writes today.,Surprised
570,Yeah... bambi was pretty scary though for a cartoon... so was Dumbo too!,Surprised
570,Maybe that's why boy from the shining didn't know he was acting in a horror firm.  Now that was down right creepy.,Neutral
570,Holy cow!  REally?  That is creepy... but imagine how he felt once hee saw the film?,Curious to dive deeper
570,Was reading the section on animals.  There are about 20 quintillion of them.  What a number.  That's even higher then the national debt!!lol,Surprised
570,Hahahaaaa... now that's funny!  That is a high number... but give it time... it will get there!  LOL,Curious to dive deeper
570,That's the first I've heard that number.  How about hiccups being a holdover when animals had both gills and lungs.  Weird.,Surprised
570,That is interesting for sure!  Love that the Lochness monster is a protected species!,Happy
570,Gonna have to remember that one.  And maybe shave my dog's head to see if she has a white patch on her forehead!!,Surprised
570,really?  I don't know if i buy into that!,Fearful
570,Thats one for google.  All my dog and cat lover friends I think I'll starting calling them ailurophiles or cynophiles and see the looks they get on their faces.,Curious to dive deeper
570,Well... i would surely give you a look of what the....  Funny the first cloned animal was a cat and they named it copy cat!,Happy
570," That's clever actually.  Although I think cloning is weird.  I wonder why you don't ""own"" pets but are guardians in boulder, co.",Curious to dive deeper
570,Because they are a weird state and don't believe in owning anything that is alive,Surprised
570,OH..makes sense I guess. I always was a aware thatTeddy Roosevelt had a bear and hyena.  Didn't know he had over 20 pets though.  Now he was a weird one too,Surprised
570,That's true... and what the heck does one person do with that many pets?!?,Surprised
570,Let them chase the white house aides around!!,Surprised
570,hahaaaaaa... great chat!  have a good one!,Neutral
571,Are you a fan of horror movies?,Curious to dive deeper
571,Yes I like some of them. Do you know which movies Stephen King thinks is the scariest?,Curious to dive deeper
571,Yes he thinks it is Bambi the one with the deer cartoon,Curious to dive deeper
571,Yes I guess the scene where the mom is killed can be scary,Curious to dive deeper
571,I guess so. Did you know you burn more calories watching them?,Curious to dive deeper
571,Yes about 180 more calories than regular movies,Curious to dive deeper
571,I know. But there is good in watching horror movies too,Curious to dive deeper
571,Yes it is good to watch them before you go to an art gallery with abstract art,Curious to dive deeper
571," Yes as you enjoy it more, the brain is amazing",Curious to dive deeper
571,Yes it is. Do you know how they make the creepy noises in those movies?,Curious to dive deeper
571,Yes there is an instrument called a waterphone that they use,Curious to dive deeper
571,Yes it is just too scary for my taste,Curious to dive deeper
571,Mine too. Do you like animals?,Curious to dive deeper
571,I love them. Do you know how many are there?,Curious to dive deeper
571,Yes about 20 quintillion but do not ask me how many zeroes are in that,Curious to dive deeper
571,Haha me too. Do you have any domesticated animals?,Curious to dive deeper
571,Yes a cat and I hear they usually develop white patches on the forehead but mine does not have one,Curious to dive deeper
571," Mine does not either, I have a small dog. I wonder how valid this is",Curious to dive deeper
571,Me too. Did you know the Loch Ness Monster is a protected species?,Curious to dive deeper
571," Yeah and no one has ever seen it, go figure. Nice chat!",Curious to dive deeper
571,Same here and have a good one,Curious to dive deeper
572," did you know Stephen king was terrified as a child when he saw the movie bambi, calling it the first horror movie he saw.",Surprised
572," Yes, it's crazy that watching calories can burn more than 180 calories",Surprised
572,i need to start watching morw scary movies haha i seen a thing called a waterline makes up most of the creepy sounds in horror films. How cool is that.,Curious to dive deeper
572," I had no idea, I find it so funny that the boy from the shining had no idea he was acting in a horror movie until many years later",Curious to dive deeper
572,they do that alot with very young actors!,Neutral
572," I had no idea, but I'm sure that would make sense since they're young and don't really know what is happening",Neutral
572,and that way they won't be scared so much. i think it would be good.,Neutral
572," Have you ever heard that it is not legal to own pets in boulder, CO? You can be their guardian though, whatever that means!",Curious to dive deeper
572,oh wow that's odd. i wish i could have studied zoology more in college!,Neutral
572,Me too! Also Theodore roosevelt had a ton of pets like a bear and a hyena,Surprised
572," that's cool!!!  i just read Under the provisions of the 1912 scottish protection of animals act, the loch ness monster is a protected species. ......how cool is that!!!",Curious to dive deeper
572," That is awesome! Never would have heard of that. In Germany in 2002 they became the first country to give animals constitunonal legal rights, crazy!",Surprised
572,that is crazy haha! So cat lover is known as an ailurophile and a dog lover is known as a cynophile!,Neutral
572,I wonder why I never learned any of that in school!,Neutral
572,in kind of wondering the same thing!  The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat lol so funny,Surprised
572," that is funny, I can't believe there are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia! I've never met anyone that has a pet tiger",Surprised
572,i haven't either. that would be a bit scary!  Did you know There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth?,Surprised
572,I'm not even sure that i know how many quintillion is to be honest.. I think its so crazy that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated. I wonder how that even works??,Surprised
572,it's alot haha and yeah i don't know how the whole dot thing would work either. that's so odd!,Curious to dive deeper
572," That is odd, im going to have to look that one up for sure. Also insane how there are more pets in japan than children under 15? I would assume there would be billions of children there. ",Surprised
572,wow what weird rules there are. thanks for the chat :) Bye now,Neutral
573,Do you have a pet?,Curious to dive deeper
573,I have a dog.  I used to have two dogs and two cats.,Curious to dive deeper
573," I love dogs, what is your dogs name?",Curious to dive deeper
573,Popcorn.  She kept jumping when she saw us for the first time at the rescue center.,Curious to dive deeper
573,awww that is so cute! What kind of dog is it.,Curious to dive deeper
573,Australian shepherd.,Curious to dive deeper
573," I love those dogs, my brother has one, his name is Rogue. Amazing animals. Pets are great, I used to have a rat terrier named Rocky",Curious to dive deeper
573," Apparently, hiccups are a holdover from early evolution when early land animals had both gills and lungs.",Curious to dive deeper
573," wow that is crazy to think. I wish we still had gills, it would make swimming more enjoyable lol",Curious to dive deeper
573," I agree.   Apparently, loch ness monster is a protected species in Scotland.",Neutral
573," no way! the loch ness is one of 20 quintillion animals on earth, if it is real, are you a believer?",Curious to dive deeper
573,I'm not sure.  Apparently Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into two groups.,Curious to dive deeper
573," I wonder how he divided them, do you know?",Curious to dive deeper
573,Animalia (multicellular) and Protozoa (single cell),Neutral
573," wow, you think they would have more than that lol. Crazy, speaking of pets though I just remembered the boulder it is not legal to own a pet, but instead be the guardian, how do you feel a bout that",Curious to dive deeper
573," It's rather strange, I must say.",Surprised
573," Yea, it is not like they can consent to anything or make their own decision mostly. I don't know, I think boulder is kind of strange area too lol",Curious to dive deeper
573," I have never been there.  Most of pets are used by humans as company, protection and entertainment.  Some people use pets as working animals.",Happy
573," Here is a crazy fact to end with. There are more tigers living as pets in the USA than living wild in asia, very interesting. It was so great chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
573," Wow, I did not know that.  Nice chatting with you too.",Happy
573,Have a great weekend!,Curious to dive deeper
574,Hey have you ever seen the movie show dogs? You think it's appropriate for kids,Curious to dive deeper
574," It has been awhile, but I know it is said to be kid friendly. Are you a dog fan?",Curious to dive deeper
574," Yes I love dogs, I love how they are Man's Best Friend, what about you?",Happy
574,Definitely a dog person. According to Google's code of conduct they state they are a dog company.,Surprised
574," Well that's good to know! Also good to know that dogs are not actually colorblind, they only can see limited colors though oh, that makes me feel better",Surprised
574,I know! It goes against all I was ever taught!! Dogs really are great. They were the first species to be domesticated.,Curious to dive deeper
574," Yep that's impressive! Also impressive that they have 12 different blood types, I wonder if they do dog blood drives",Curious to dive deeper
574,I have heard that they do. Dogs do take on some pretty amazing roles for humans from hunting and herding to companionship and coming to the aid of disabled people.,Curious to dive deeper
574," Yes dogs are so nice and also useful for helping humans, I also like how istanbul has trained dogs to grab the trash in their city in exchange for treats",Happy
574," Oh, that's great! Dogs are so smart. I know dogs and elephants are the only animals that seem to instinctively understand pointing.",Surprised
574," Yes you're right, I wonder if gorillas can understand that or if they can't? What do you think about movies with dogs? I would like dog comedies myself like the movie Isle of dogs",Happy
574,I think they're cute. I have not seen that one.,Curious to dive deeper
574," Yeah it's actually really good. I like a lot of comedies, especially the movie Kung Fu Hustle",Happy
574,I don't think I've heard of that. I see a lot of action movies like Deadpool since I have boys that are older.,Curious to dive deeper
574," Yes I like Deadpool, I didn't really care for Deadpool 2 but it was ok, what did you think",Happy
574,Deadpool 2 is pretty bloody and raunchy with a lot of references to pop culture that I'm not sure my teen understood.,Curious to dive deeper
574," It's definitely a movie more for adults, did you see that Ryan Reynolds actually does the voice of the mystery villain in that movie though? I will want to watch Deadpool 3 at some point",Surprised
574," No, I did not. I'll have to check it out.  I do like that DP2 was targeted toward adults so maybe 3 will do the same. It makes it more tolerable.",Happy
574," Yes it's definitely going to Target adults, did you hear that James Cameron and David Fincher both were instrumental in getting the first Deadpool movie made",Surprised
574," No, I had no idea. What did they do?",Curious to dive deeper
574," They just kept petitioning the studio which was 20th Century Fox to go forward with the project, they felt it would be a success",Happy
575," hi, do you like dogs?",Curious to dive deeper
575,Hi and yes i love dogs!  I like how they are related to wolves.  I wonder what their original ancestor was like.  Do you like dogs?,Neutral
575," I love dogs, they have 12 types of blood",Curious to dive deeper
575,I had no idea about that.  i guess that means it's hard for them to get blood transfers when they need one.,Neutral
575,yeah but good things is that there are dog blood drives,Curious to dive deeper
575,Are there really?  I have never seen or heard about one before. I would definitely take my dog to give blood if I could.,Neutral
575,Yeah not sure which countries have them though. do you know how tou can help dogs in Istanbul?,Curious to dive deeper
575,I  think I have heard about that country having vending machines for food and water for stray dogs. All that is required for payment is plastic bottles.,Neutral
575," yeah I really like that approach, that is super nice for the dogs and the environment",Curious to dive deeper
575," I like it too.  America and actually, all other countries, should adopt that approach.  Dogs are very smart. They are the only animal other than an elephant that understands pointing.",Neutral
575," that is true, you are right. google even prefers dogs",Curious to dive deeper
575,I am glad to hear that for some reason!  I like knowing that one of my favorite sites to use likes dogs. I am surprised though that they have taken a stand regarding it.,Neutral
575,yeah it is in their code of conduct even,Curious to dive deeper
575,Pretty impressive!  I will tell you something equally as impressive.  I know for a fact that dogs watch television.  They are not colorblind and they understand a great many of our words.,Neutral
575,yeah they just see less colors than we do,Curious to dive deeper
575,They have had such a long history of association with humans thought that they understand human behavior.,Neutral
575," yeah exactly, they are known as our best friends after all",Curious to dive deeper
575,Yes they are.  It's weird to me that they can thrive on a starch rich diet.  It seems like they would prefer to have meat.,Neutral
575," yeah, it is their diet from the wild so that makes sense",Curious to dive deeper
575," Now that you mention it, it does. I have seen stray dogs that have been dumped by people eat corn and grass in fields before.  It's sad that people dump dogs, especially when they can do so many different things.  Dogs are not only great hunters but are also great in therapy roles as well.",Neutral
575," They sure are, we must be grateful to have them around. nice chat",Happy
576,Hello,Happy
576,Hello. Do you know the dog as the first species to be domesticated?,Curious to dive deeper
576,I did.  Had a discussion with a friend of mine about it last week.  They are all a bunch of little wolves.,Happy
576,Their ancestry does go back to the wolf but dogs are more suited for human companionship.,Neutral
576," Yeah, they took a notion to getting access to food.  Cats never really changed, they are still just cats.  Mini lions and tigers, really.",Happy
576,My own dog is good for hunting and for protection. I have a Boston.,Neutral
576,Then your dog would be welcome at Google.  They are apparently anti-cat there.,Happy
576,I heard that as well. Dogs are the perfect companion and well behaved if trained properly.,Neutral
576," I had honestly never heard of ""Dog Blood Drives"" until today.  I really did not know that was a thing.",Happy
576,I found it surprising that dogs have 12 different blood types. My dog has never donated blood.,Surprised
576," Here's my thing.  People say that only dogs and elephants understand pointing.  Okay, that's fine, but what about apes, monkeys and corvids?  They are all relatively smart, as animals go.  Seems to me that there would be some inherent pointing in there somewhere.",Happy
576,I would agree that that point is hard to believe. I know apes and monkeys are able to point as well.,Neutral
576,The not being color blind part is interesting as well.  I had always been taught that dogs just see in shades of grey.,Happy
576,I need to start one of the vending businesses to provide stray animals with food and water in exchange for recyclables. Great idea!,Neutral
576," It is a cool idea.  Too bad the animals can't pay for it though.  I know that crows understand barter, but I dunno about the rest of them.  It doesn't seem super profitable.",Happy
576,I would do it just to repay dogs for all the companionship they provide to the disabled. They are truly man's best friend in my book.,Neutral
576,You do make a really good point.  I haven't seen Deadpool 2 yet. I sure do hope there are dogs in it.,Happy
576,Ryan Reynolds does a great job playing in Dead Pool. The movie is immensely popular,Neutral
576,It sounds like it.  We are really looking forward to seeing it.  It sounds like a great comedy film.,Happy
576,It is hard to believe that it is already the 11th installment in the series by 20th Century FOx,Surprised
576," Yeah, they have done REALLY well with the franchise.  I'm excited for what comes next.",Happy
577,Dogs or cats?,Curious to dive deeper
577," Dogs of course, you?",Curious to dive deeper
577,Dog for sure all day! Even google likes dogs more,Curious to dive deeper
577," Yeah they are a dog company, and thats  a great thing, I love dogs,",Curious to dive deeper
577," Me too, do you have a dog?",Curious to dive deeper
577," I have a dog, a golden retriever, do you? interesting how they can have up to 12 different types of blood",Curious to dive deeper
577," I have a rat terrier, I love him so much. His name is rocky and he is a boss! i did not know that about the blood, I wonder if they have blood drives",Curious to dive deeper
577," There are also blood drives for dogs yes, and sounds like a cute little fellow, ",Curious to dive deeper
577," What! He is awesome, getting old though but lots of good memories. Did you know dogs and elephants are the only ones that respond to pointing. My dog loves that",Curious to dive deeper
577," I didnt know that, I guess both are really smart animals, dogs can also see color so that makes them kind of unique ",Curious to dive deeper
577,For sure! Did you ever see Deadpool 2?,Curious to dive deeper
577," I did, that movie was so fun, I really liked it, did you like it?",Curious to dive deeper
577,It was actually really good. I liked lady luck! Do you like comedy films?,Curious to dive deeper
577," I do like them yea, one of my favorite actors is Bill Murray",Curious to dive deeper
577," Me too, I love me some Bill Murray movies, have you seen Kung Fu Hustle?",Curious to dive deeper
577," I have seen it yeah, why do you ask?",Curious to dive deeper
577," Was it comedy gold like Bill Murray said it was, or was he being sarcastic?",Curious to dive deeper
577," It was comedy, I liked it, but I wouldnt call it the supreme achievement, I think he was sarcastic when he said that",Curious to dive deeper
577," lol, that is so like Bill Murray. It was so nice talking with you!",Curious to dive deeper
577," He is a grea actor, I like him as well, another great actor is Ryan Stiles, so funny",Curious to dive deeper
577," For sure, that guy never graduated high school. Look how far he has come! Have a great day! Give you dog some hugs for me!",Curious to dive deeper
577," That sounds like a hard call, not going to high school to persue a carreer in comedy and I will, you do the same with yours. ",Curious to dive deeper
578,I am not a fan of Mitch McConnell.  The senate majority leader has gone somewhat nuts.,Angry
578," Good afternoon, I try to avoid the political shenanigans.  It's just one shyster trying to get something over on the other guy, all the time.  ",Disgusted
578,Yes but even in 2016 the CIA was meeting with senior congressional leaders over the fact that Putin had authorized an operation to destabilize our election,Angry
578," That's Putin for you, he's going to do that, hard to believe it took the CIA needing to tell them he was doing it.  I'm sure all of our ""frenemies""  do the same thing and we do it to them, too.",Sad
578,Yes but it is scary that McConnell is denying the evidence and claiming that it is just a scheme by the CIA to discredit Trump.  He does not believe all of our national security agencies.,Angry
578," On a different and much happier note than all that crazy political mess, do you realize the consistent use of the red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats only started in 2000?  That's probably about the time it started to get real ugly in politics.",Surprised
578,Yes that is crazy but it has been ugly for a while - Harry Truman visited disneyland and refused to be photographed on the dumbo ride because it might associate him with republicans!,Surprised
578," You know the voter turnout for a US presidential election hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years.  I'm going to be watching 2020, I think Trump can break that!",Surprised
578,Certainly he has 60 percent of the country who think he is doing a horrible job so it might increase the turnout!  Too bad we can't have third parties - there has not been one elected since 1853,Neutral
578," Actually, I think there are that many that WANT to vote for him and are going to turn out to vote against whatever candidate the Dems throw up there.  That third party thing has never seemed to work out too well, a shame.",Happy
578,Well if he grew a beard it might help his chances - every president with a beard ever has been a republican,Neutral
578," Well, that's a Southern/ Texas thing, a beard and that is the base for the Republicans, so that makes perfect sense to me. But, I usually look at the taller candidate, they seem to win 75% of the time, so maybe the Dems should be looking for them a giant?",Surprised
578,That is a good point.  Beto O'Rourke is crazy tall - maybe he will win.   I think Nevada has the right plan - they have a none of these candidates option on their ballot,Curious to dive deeper
578," Or do what the officials in Ancient Athens did and appoint by lottery.  It you get picked, you get picked, do the job, and then move on and let the next one be picked to serve.  Probably more fair of a way than all the BIG money being pumped by both sides.",Curious to dive deeper
578,I agree.  Though I might go for term limits other a true lottery - I can think of a lot of my friends who I would not want making decisions in the government!,Neutral
578," Oh, I got a few of them kind as well, friend.  I didn't realize that in the 2012 US elections international electoral observers were blocked from the polls in nine states.  I wonder if the CIA knew about that?  Maybe they were trying to pull something to affect our elections?",Curious to dive deeper
578,Yes there has been some craziness over the years.  I mean one year the ballot counting in Florida was stopped by the brother of the guy running for President - how would that have looked if it had happened in Africa or somewhere?  Fishy?,Curious to dive deeper
578," You know I'm from Florida and I love the Bush family.  They are good people and I remember them elections well, all we heard on mainstream media was this county here is majority Democrats, but how is it that 90% voted for the Republican candidate.  We're all registered Democrats, but vote Republican.",Happy
578," Why register Democrat then?    By 2000, the Republican party has firmly aligned with Christian conservatism, and has its chief support from the south, the great plains and the mountain states.",Curious to dive deeper
578," Once a great while ago, the Democrats did represent us, though it no longer does now. Me for example if I want to have more"" opportunities"" to vote in Local elections, I have to be registered how the majority of the candidates are registered as.  So, if only Democrat candidates are running, well I better be a Democrat for awhile on paper and switch back after the election.  Designation means NOTHING.  Leftists need to learn that lesson.  Everybody knows the coast and big cities are Democrats and rural south and heartland states are Republicans.",Curious to dive deeper
578,Absolutely.  I have voted in Republican primaries in Texas for the most moderate candidate before.,Neutral
579,Hey do you ever play video games? Have you ever played the game The Thin silence,Curious to dive deeper
579,hi how are you? i used to play video games. The Thin Silence? i havent heard of it.,Neutral
579," Yes apparently it's being developed by Two PM Studios, it sounds really crazy it uses the look of videogames from the 80's",Surprised
579,What? the 80s? like NES and stuff?  Why? seems odd.,Neutral
579,Yes I think so! Do you play any video games by the way?,Curious to dive deeper
579," i used to play a long long time ago. havent played recently. the systems look cool, but i dont have the time LOL",Neutral
579," Yeah I hear you on that haha. It's funny that initially video games were called ""cathode ray tube Amusement devices""LOL that sucks all the fun out of them",Surprised
579," That is a totally military name. too many words, too official sounding. pointless.",Neutral
579,Have you ever visited South Korea? Apparently if you're under 16 it's illegal for you to play video games after midnight haha,Surprised
579,I think that there is a video game craze there. plus there are games cafes that are open all night,Neutral
579," That sounds pretty cool. Did you ever play a video game based on Toy Story? Apparently Tom Hanks his brother, Jim Hanks, does all of the voices for Woody in the video games",Surprised
579," that's great. Tom has enough money, and his brother could use the work. how would you like to be his brother? That would be tough, overshadowed by Tom",Neutral
579," It would be tough but you're still making a lot of money haha. Have you ever played the Harry Potter video games or even LittleBigPlanet? Apparently this guy Stephen Fry does the narration in those games, I bet he also makes a lot of money",Curious to dive deeper
579," I have not. Stephen is a tremendous screen talent as well. i dont know how old he is, but he has been around for decades. wrote a book too, i think",Neutral
579,Oh wow that's cool. Do you like any movie soundtracks by the way? I know we were just talking about Toy Story and that has a good soundtrack,Curious to dive deeper
579," Toy Story was tremendous. great casting, great characters, great story, great tunes. ",Neutral
579," Yeah I agree with you. I also like the Jaws soundtrack, the Jaws theme is incredible! And Steven Spielberg even makes an appearance on the soundtrack because he plays the clarinet on it LOL",Surprised
579,I did not know that spielberg played the clarinet. thats great. i wonder how many other soundtracks he played on.,Neutral
579," That's a good question, have you ever seen the movie O Brother Where Art Thou? Apparently it's soundtrack was certified 8 times Platinum",Surprised
579," Yeah, that was a great film. Clooney sang the song originally. then they found a real singer.",Neutral
579," Haha you're right! I think Phil Collins is a great singer, he did the soundtrack for Tarzan, and then recorded it in like five different languages, that's impressive in my opinion!",Happy
580,hey did you know the Senate used a gavel for 165 years until Nixon cracked it,Surprised
580,Hello - no I did not know that. Pretty cool.,Surprised
580," ya he ruined it! there is a Candy desk in the senate apparently, sounds delicious!",Surprised
580,That does sound pretty good! Michael Jordan once responded that republicans buy shoes too so he didn't endorse the democratic candidate.,Surprised
580," haha well I wish more people took his advice and kept out of politics, really weird that women couldnt wear pants in the senate until 1993",Surprised
580,haha yea I was just reading that. Said something about staging a protest wearing pantsuits.,Surprised
580,ya it was Barbara Mikulski and Carl Moseley who did a protest by wearing pantsuits,Surprised
580,That's funny. Did you know there hasn't been a president who wasn't a republican or democrat since 1853?,Surprised
580," no that is kind of crazy, also crazy is that only republicans have beards apparently, no democrat presidents have had one",Surprised
580,Wow that's crazy I had no idea they never have had a beard as a democrat.,Surprised
580," no I didn't either, also crazy is that the use of red and blue colors only started in 2000 for repubs and ems",Surprised
580,Interesting....I didn't know that either. The last republican was elected  president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was 1928.,Surprised
580," wow, but I think that is outdated information because Trump is now president haha",Surprised
580,Yea I think so too lol. What are your thoughts on Trump?,Surprised
580,Eh I don't talk politics but I do think it's funny that Truman wouldn't get a picture taken with Dumbo because he didn't want to be associated with the republican party.,Surprised
580,haha yea that's funny! I try not to talk politics myself.,Surprised
580," yup jost not worth it, did you know that in athens they used to choose elections by just the lottery?",Surprised
580," That's pretty crazy they used the lottery for elections. I saw that since 1900, the taller candidate has won the presidential election 75% of the time.",Surprised
580," ya so the democrats should maybe run a basketball player in 2020? haha, but ya its scary that in 2012 international election observers were blocked from 9 states",Surprised
580,HAHA that's a good one!,Happy
580," haha, also I think we should all do what nevada does and have a ""none of these candidates"" options when we vote",Happy
581," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
581,Not bad.   Do you know anything about Mitch McConnell?,Curious to dive deeper
581,I know very little. I used to watch a ton of politics but not any more. Too depressing. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
581,I agree.    The Brett Kavanaugh thing was quite a debacle!,Sad
581,Yeah. Unlike the gavel they use for 165 year. That thing was solid!,Happy
581,Did you know the Senate still could choose the Vice President if the vote does not results in one candidate with a majority!,Surprised
581,I did not. I would like to use the obsure rule and arrest enators to vote. Seems like a good plan!,Surprised
581,A prison with a candy desk cannot be too terrible!,Happy
581," Well, it's still a prison. Did you mean Senate? I mean they may be synanyms....",Happy
581," Yes.    You arrest someone, you take them to prison, whether it is a jail or the Senate!",Sad
581,HA! I get it now. Im an idiot. Nice joke!,Happy
581,Did you know ever president has been a republican or democrat since 1853.,Sad
581,Women were not allowed to wear pants until 1993. Sees sexist!,Surprised
581," That is true.  Maybe they did it right in ancient athens, where leaders were appointed by lottery.",Surprised
581,I had no idea that GOP stood for Grand Old Party. Seems like a really old white thing...,Happy
581," Well, every president with a beard was Republican, so who knows!",Surprised
581,Truman refused to go on the dumbo ride for fear of being pictured on a elephant...,Surprised
581," Truman was not a tall fellow, so might have trouble in contemporary politics.",Sad
581,I had no idea that red and blue for parties only started in 2000?,Happy
581," Yes.    If they changed the colors, do you think voter turnout might surpass 62.8%?",Sad
581,Nice chatting with you!,Happy
582," Hi, do you enjoy conspiracy theory?",Curious to dive deeper
582," Hello - I do enjoy them. Not that I believe most, but they make you think. What about you?",Curious to dive deeper
582,I do not follow them but I do find humor in them so I will listen. I guess Mitch McConnell is one.,Curious to dive deeper
582,Same here. Do you know much about the US senate?,Curious to dive deeper
582," I know a little. What about you, do you know a lot?",Curious to dive deeper
582,Just a little. I know Jordan was once asked why he wouldn't endorse black democratic candidate Gantt which Jordan said republicans buy shoes too.,Surprised
582," That's the kind of leadership I expect from Jordan! They had the same gavel until Richard ""the Hulk"" nixon broke it!",Happy
582,Me too. Haha that's hilarious he broke it!,Surprised
582,Maybe he had some of that candy from the senate floor!,Happy
582,Possibly. Did you know Hillary Clinton was president of the young republicans in college?,Surprised
582,I wonder why she switched?Roosevelt created the bull moose party after being rejected by the GOP.,Surprised
582,Not sure on that. There is a republican vs democrat baseball game every year since 1909.,Surprised
582," Wow, that's cool but also, shouldn't they worry about the nation? I knew bull moose wouldn't work because every president has been a republic or democrat since 1853.",Surprised
582,I think so too. The only American president to propose a minimum income was Richard Nixon.,Surprised
582,Wow. Good trivia. Like every bearded president has been republican.,Surprised
582,That's interesting too. A dog beat two people in a mayoral election and server as mayor for 13 years.,Surprised
582,I would feel bad if I were those two! Red and blue were not used until 2000. Seems like that is really recent.,Surprised
582,That's very recent. I would have never guessed that.,Surprised
582,I wouldn't have guessed Truman to be insecure but he didn't want to go on the dumbo ride for fear of being associated with republicans.,Surprised
582,LOL I didn't know he was that insecure.,Surprised
582,Nice chatting with you!,Happy
583,Hi! You play video games? I think it's funny they were intially called cathode ray tube amusement devices!,Curious to dive deeper
583,I know I am so glad we switched to just calling them video games,Curious to dive deeper
583,Yes so much easier. In South Korea it's illegal for kids 16 and under to play video games past midnight. I would have broken the law a lot if I grew up there!,Happy
583,Me too and I wonder how they can tell. Do you know who Stephen Fry is?,Curious to dive deeper
583," Isn't he that narrator who narrated little big planet, and some other games as well? I thought his name sounded familiar, I would probably recognize his voice. ",Curious to dive deeper
583," Yes he did that and the harry potter and hitchhiker's guide to galaxy, such a talent",Curious to dive deeper
583,Very cool. Tom Hanks brother voice must sound quite similar because he voices Woody in the video games!,Surprised
583,Cool. Do you know how many hours of video games we play as a planet in a week?,Curious to dive deeper
583,3 billion hours! That is so hard to believe but they are so much fun!,Surprised
583,I know they are. Do you listen to soundtracks?,Curious to dive deeper
583,Yeah I loved the Bohemian Rapsody soundtrack cause Queen is awesome. The Jaws soundtrack was cool and Spielberg actually played the clarinet in the soundtrack!,Curious to dive deeper
583,THat guy is so talented. Did you know Phil Collins did the soundtrack for Tarzan in 5 languages?,Curious to dive deeper
583," No I only heard it in English! But yeah looks like it was in Italian, German, Spanish, and French! Very cool.",Surprised
583,I know.Did you know that Duft Punk did the Tron Legacy soundtrack?,Curious to dive deeper
583,Yeah I do know that. They negotiated the soundtrack over a pancake breakfast.,Surprised
583,Yeah pretty cool and they were wearing the robot helmets,Curious to dive deeper
583,How could they eat with those lol? Each of the track titles on the Batman begins soundtrack is the name of the genus or family of bat.,Surprised
583," That is so creative actually. Did you know the soundtrack for Oh Brother, Where Art Thou is certified platinum?",Curious to dive deeper
583,I loved that soundtrack and movie! Certified 8 times platinum actually. Well it was great talking with you good night.,Happy
583," Pretty impressive. Same here, have a good one",Curious to dive deeper
583,Bye!,Neutral
584,hey my friend did you ever see the movie Jaws?,Curious to dive deeper
584," I did, I thought it was scary back in the day, what are your thoughts on the movie?",Curious to dive deeper
584," oh its scary and its a classic, and I guess the director played the clarinet in the soundtrack",Surprised
584," Yeah I heard Spielberg played the clarinet, I must say he is pretty good, never imagined it was him",Curious to dive deeper
584,did you see the movie o brother where art thou? Directed by the coens?,Curious to dive deeper
584," No, I think I didnt watch that one, who is Coens? ",Curious to dive deeper
584," theyre brothers that direct movies together, but anyway the soundtrack is good it was certified platinum 8 times",Surprised
584," It was pretty good, scary as well, I think the soundtrack is one of the most important factors for the success of the movie",Curious to dive deeper
584," oh ya definitely, do you like Phil collins btw?",Curious to dive deeper
584," I do like him, he recorded the sountrack for Tarzan right?",Curious to dive deeper
584," ya he did, in like 5 different foreign languages too, that's impressive!",Surprised
584," It is impressive he must be really smart, that's not an easy feat",Curious to dive deeper
584," no I agree, I would definitely have gone right for the professionals, I wouldn't have stayed in college haha",Curious to dive deeper
584,Do you like Daft Punk?,Curious to dive deeper
584," I do actually, didn't they negotiate the tron contract over pancakes? Pretty awesome!",Surprised
584," Yeah, over a pancake breakbast, Tron Legacy was a great movie and the soundtrack was supreme",Curious to dive deeper
584," oh I agree, also crazy is the batman begins soundtrack names its tracks after different types of bats",Surprised
584," Thats an interesting fact, I love Batman movies and havent noticed that detail, do you play video games?",Curious to dive deeper
584," I do, I played the NES up to the Nintendo Switch haha what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
584," Same bought the original system and also have a switch now, I'm a Nintendo fan.",Curious to dive deeper
584," ya I agree, its crazy though that we as a society play about 3 billion hours of videogames each week",Surprised
584," That seems like a lot of time wasted, I wonder how Jane Mcgonigal did his calculations.",Curious to dive deeper
585," Hi, how are you?",Happy
585," Good, thank you - yourself? do you play video games?",Curious to dive deeper
585," I am well, thanks for asking. I used to play a lot but I got married and my priorities shifted. What about you?",Happy
585,no not really. my kids do though. did you know the creator of atrari made chuckie chese to get kids to play games?,Curious to dive deeper
585,Really!??? That's so interesting! What a crazy idea to get people to play video games?,Happy
585,Video gaming wasn't as big then! I remeber my kids playing mortal kombat. Do you know that why they started rating video games?,Curious to dive deeper
585,Mortal combat is why they started rating video games? That seems like a benign game though.,Surprised
585," It does now, but when it first came out? It seemed really violent. Australia probably banned it!",Curious to dive deeper
585,South Koreans 16 & under cannot play video games past midnight. Seems agist!,Surprised
585,I think they want them to concentrate on getting some sleep! Video games make more money then films do!,Curious to dive deeper
585," That seems odd but I guess if you add in things like facebook games, that makes sense.",Surprised
585,and the price doesn't seem to go down for video games like it does for movies. Is there any soundtrack from a video game you like?,Curious to dive deeper
585,Not really. I cant even think of a soundtrack for a video game. Is that a thing?,Curious to dive deeper
585,It is! My guys like Mach the knife from some game. Introduced them to 40's and 50's music. Have you heard of the bank JP MOrgan?,Curious to dive deeper
585,I have heard of that bank. Do you use them?,Curious to dive deeper
585," no, but I read a fact the other day. Did you know they bailed the US government out of debt in 1895? I wonder if they are the Federal reserve?",Curious to dive deeper
585,HA! I think they got a huge bail out in 2007 so I think we are even...,Happy
585,Good deal! Were you affected by the recent government shutdown?,Curious to dive deeper
585,I was not. I was saddened by it. Were you affected?,Curious to dive deeper
585,No thankfully! But I was surprised by the folks not having saved any money. The government has shut down 17 times in the last 37 years.,Curious to dive deeper
585,Such a shame... Nice chatting with you!,Happy
586,Have you heard the recent stuff about Kavanaugh?,Neutral
586," Somewhat, Never know what to believe.",Curious to dive deeper
586," Yeah, I hear McConnell is out to destroy his reputation, or whatever is left of it.",Curious to dive deeper
586," Really, Did you know since the 1900's in elections the taller person usually won 75% of the time!",Surprised
586,I heard that.  We gotta start looking for some tall people to run in 2020,Neutral
586," lol, Using the lottery to appoint leaders is scary like they did in ancient Athens! ",Surprised
586,Very true.  I wouldnt just want any random politician in charge.,Neutral
586," True, They thought it would lead to oligarchy.",Surprised
586," It could have.  I think we need what Nevada has, a none of these candidates option on the ballot.",Neutral
586,I was thinking the same thing! Why are they the only state? All states should have that.,Curious to dive deeper
586,It would really let the government know what the people are thinking.,Neutral
586," I agree, I'm surprised its only republican presidents that have had beards!",Surprised
586," Yeah, there havent been that many at that either.",Surprised
586," Two, lol Its funny they have a candy desk at the senate filled with chocolate bars and jellybeans!",Surprised
586,Id be claiming that as my desk!  I heard all the candy is made in PA,Neutral
586," Yes, I bet it helps keep their sugar levels up while making important decisions. ",Happy
586,When the actually do that.  It seems like they are always out and rarely in session,Neutral
586," lol, yes. I'm surprised it wasn't until 1993 that women could wear pants on the senate floor! ",Surprised
586," I know.  I cant believe it took that long, Iam glad Mikulski and Braun staged that protest.",Neutral
586,Too bad Richard Nixon cracked the senate gavel that was 165 years old. It must be in a museum somewhere now. Good chat!!,Surprised
586,Have a good day!,Neutral
587,Are you afraid of snakes?,Curious to dive deeper
587," Hi, I am a little! but I was surprised there are none in New Zealand!",Happy
587," Sounds like a perfect place for me lol, Im terrified of them",Fearful
587," Wow! I can understand , I am more terrified of crocodiles  but it seems they are closer to birds than to snakes!",Fearful
587,Some snakes can even fly to catch their prey so thats scary,Curious to dive deeper
587," Wow, I would like to see that!  And did you know its head is designed to swallow prays larger than them",Happy
587," Yeah I did know that, thats actually a bit disgusting, watching them eat prey",Disgusted
587,It looks like monkeys are terrified of snakes too!,Happy
587," They are? monkey are smart, they should stay as far as they can of snakes, dangerous animals",Fearful
587,Maybe you are terrified of snakes! But do you like dancing?,Happy
587," Thats something im not afraid off, im not a good dancer but I try, do you like to dance.",Curious to dive deeper
587," Yes, but I did not kow Bruce Lee was a great dancer!!",Happy
587,He was? wasnt he also famous for his martial arts skills,Curious to dive deeper
587," Yes, and he won in 1958 a cha cha championship in Hong Kong",Happy
587," Oh so he won a chacha championship, that must require a lot of dancing skills. ",Curious to dive deeper
587,That is right!! Maybe he started since he was a baby! They love when they hear the beat and they even smile!,Happy
587," Thats really nice, watching a baby dance, did you like Michael Jackson as a dancer?",Curious to dive deeper
587,I think he is great!! he has great dance moves and I always remember the way he leaned in smooth criminal,Happy
587," I agree with you, he had great moves, do you remember the device he used to lean? he has that one patented",Curious to dive deeper
587," I do not know the name, but I would like to find out!.. Did you know Tupac danced in school in the Nutcracker? as the King Mouse?",Happy
587," I didnt, thats a fun fact, thanks for the chat, its been nice having a conversation about dancind, not so much about snakes  but great dance talk, thanks, have a nice day",Curious to dive deeper
588," Good morning.  So, the other day I was shopping for a shirt and then I heard that originally shirts used to be an item worn exclusively by men.  How strange.",Curious to dive deeper
588,Maybe because women only wore dresses?,Curious to dive deeper
588," Maybe, that would make sense.  In America we will call most anything a shirt, but in British English it is specifically what we would refer to as a dress shirt.  That could be confusing if you are visiting another country.",Curious to dive deeper
588," Oh, so that is probably what they meant-women did not used to wear dress shirts.",Curious to dive deeper
588," Maybe.  I am glad I don't work somewhere I have to wear dress shirts or button up shirts.  There are also button down shirts, which is where the collar also has buttons.",Happy
588," If you're in Hawaii, the official business attire is the aloha shirt. That seems fun.",Surprised
588,Which is why I love Hawaii so much.  Aloha shirts are great.,Happy
588," In China gangs used to layer on as many shirts as possible. That seems, um, uncomfortable.",Surprised
588," Yeah, and they used to pop the collars.  I remember when popping your polo shirt collar was a fashion around here.",Neutral
588,It's interesting that polo shirts were invented for one specific tennis player.,Surprised
588," Yeah, the ones with the crocodile on them.",Curious to dive deeper
588,It's interesting that they got named polo shirts since polo players didn't adopt them until later.,Surprised
588,It's funny how clothing gets certain names.,Neutral
588," Yes, it is. I like to wear polos when I go out. I think they are fancy enough for a night out. I'd like to attend a monthly music fest that occurs at Gee's club.",Happy
588,Oh yeah?  I have heard about that place.  What kind of music is played there?,Curious to dive deeper
588," They play oldies. Since about a year and a half ago since the death of Royal Torrence, it's been a monthly affair. ",Happy
588,That sounds like a lot of fun.  I heard they have a lot of different musicians that play there.,Curious to dive deeper
588," Yeah, it is pretty popular. It's only a $5 donation.",Happy
588," Oh wow, that's neat that it is a donation and not a mandatory cover.  I am sure a lot of people go there to drink and dance and listen to all kinds of music.",Surprised
588," Yeah, it's cool that it started to celebrate someone's life when they died. Much cooler than a funeral.",Happy
588,I agree.  We should celebrate life any way that we can and celebrate the people that are no longer with us.  I will have to go check out the Gee Club sometime.,Neutral
588," Barbara Washington says she doesn't care if you're young or old, let the good times roll! It's fun for all ages.",Happy
588," Well, thank you for telling me about it.  I am always looking for new and exciting places to visit.",Happy
589,Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;),Happy
589,Thanks and hello.,Sad
589," Hey, any chance You're Bruce Lee fan ?",Curious to dive deeper
589,Oh Yea.  You?,Sad
589,Big time ! Did You hear that Bruce lee was also a great dancer and he won the hong kong cha-cha championship in 1958 ?,Curious to dive deeper
589,I did hear that.  Emilia clarke did the funky chicken and robot dance at the audition for daenerys targaryen.,Sad
589,I am such a big fan of hers!,Curious to dive deeper
589,Did you know that there was an episode of mr. rogers where he learned to breakdance,Sad
589,I would love to see that. Did You see a movie about him ? I've heard it's good.,Curious to dive deeper
589," No, I haven't seen it but watched his show growing up.",Happy
589,I'm from Poland and I got here like 16 years ago... I've never seen it but I admire who he is and what he did...,Curious to dive deeper
589,That's cool.  I've never been to Poland.  There are ballet slippers that make drawings from the dancer's movements,Sad
589,Probably looks like a 2year old drawing :),Curious to dive deeper
589," Probably, the first moonwalk ever recorded was performed by tap dancer bill bailey in 1955!",Surprised
589,...so it's not MJ who invented it ?,Curious to dive deeper
589,I guess not.  He must have taken it and run with it though....and screamed also,Happy
589,lol ;) but that walk got famous just because Michael ;),Curious to dive deeper
589,Absolutely it did.  That dude could dance.,Happy
589,Yes he did ! and sing ;)  ...and I don't believe to all that nasty stuff they were saying about him...,Curious to dive deeper
589,There has been some rough stuff said about him for sure.,Surprised
589," yes... but once he paid... everything was fine... sorry, if something happened to my child, no money in the world would make it fine... that's why I don't believe in that...",Angry
589,Money makes people crazy seems like. Enjoyed chat.  Can you click done?,Surprised
589,it's been a pleasure ! Good day :),Happy
590," I don't much like winter, but at least there are no snakes outside.  Carnivorous reptiles can be dangerous if they are poisonous.",Curious to dive deeper
590,Or you can go to New Zealand where there are no snakes.  I wonder how that happened and none got there accidentally like on plane rides.,Curious to dive deeper
590," Yeah, you would think over time some would have gotten there.  Even stranger are that there are actually flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey.",Curious to dive deeper
590,I wonder where those are?  I hope not to see those!  The fear of snakes certainly is hard-wired into not only monkey brains but my brain too!,Surprised
590," I never really knew monkeys were afraid of snakes, but I guess it makes sense.  I wonder if they are also afraid of the legless lizards that aren't snakes.  Sounds similar to me.",Curious to dive deeper
590,Could be! Did you know that crocodiles are more closely related to birds than snakes and lizards?  I'm not sure how when they look so much like a lizard.,Surprised
590," Agreed, but I remember actually reading that somewhere before.  What I didn't realize though was that their organs were lined up one in front of the other instead of side by side.",Curious to dive deeper
590,What kind of dancing do you like?  Perhaps the cha-cha like Bruce Lee?,Curious to dive deeper
590,I'm not much of a fan of dancing.  Went back in college to a nightclub adjoining a liquor store somewhere on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.  The name escapes me though.,Neutral
590,There are lots of dance clubs in the cities.  Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music and smile more when they hit the beat.  How cute to see a baby dance!,Curious to dive deeper
590," Yeah, lots of cute videos of babies dancing.  They usually aren't wearing pointe shoes in those videos.  Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of those in a week.",Curious to dive deeper
590,Have you seen Disney's new Nutcracker movie?  I didn't get a chance.  But Tupac danced ballet in high school and played the mouse king in a production of nutcracker in high school.,Surprised
590,I have not.  I'm more of a fan of Michael Jackson and his style of dancing.  He actually has a patent on a device to allow him to do that extreme lean.,Curious to dive deeper
590," Did you ever have a Michael Jackson shirt or glove?  I prefer polo shirts, though. They originally were invented for tennis by Rene ""crocodile"" lacoste and later adopted by polo players. ",Curious to dive deeper
590," No, was a fan but not that much of a fan.  And certainly wouldn't have been a fan of layering as many shirts as you could like they did in china.",Curious to dive deeper
590," If you are a fan of khakis, you could fit in at Billy May's funeral as the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khaki's.",Curious to dive deeper
590,I like Billy mays.  He always cracked me up in his infomericals.  I could see him wearing aloha shirts to work too like they typically do in hawaii instead of suit and ite.,Curious to dive deeper
590," Yes, while most in American business are wearing dress shirts like suits and ties, Hawaiians can sport the aloha shirt.  How cool that is!",Surprised
590," Very cool!  Well, it's been nice chatting with you today.",Neutral
590," Yes, hope to make it to Hawaii some day so I can sport the Hawaiian fashion and take in the beauty there.",Happy
590,Me too.  no popped collars like they used to wear in China there.,Neutral
590,Nice talking with you.  Time to get out my polo shirt for work!,Happy
591," Hello,  do you know much about fish?  ",Neutral
591,I know a little about fish I think they are interesting. I know that black swallower fish can eat prey twice its own length and ten times its weight. I am very impressed with that fact.,Surprised
591," That is pretty amazing!  I don't think I could eat that much,  but sometimes it feels like I do!  did you know there a breed of jelly fish and lobster that is immortal.  Of course its only immortal if no one kills it lol but it literally can live forever!",Surprised
591,I actually have heard that before and wondered why we are not studying jellyfish more to find out how and why that is possible. Could we use that to our benefit in any way I wonder?,Curious to dive deeper
591," I do not know,  I just seen it on Blue Planet on Netflix lol maybe their organs do not age after a certain poing lol ",Surprised
591,Maybe. I would really like them to find out more about that. Did you know that a seahorse is the only fish with a neck?,Curious to dive deeper
591,Yeah that is interesting!  Some fish look like they have necks though lol so they have necks and can carry a baby good for them.,Surprised
591," Yes some do but only the seahorse truly does. Freshwater fish only ""drink"" water through their skin via osmosis, while saltwater fish also drink water through their mouths. I wonder how evolution made that chnage in the two?",Curious to dive deeper
591,Yeah you would think drinking salty water through your mouth would taste bad lol,Neutral
591,For us I'm sure it would. I wonder how their sense of taste differs? The last fish fact I have is that 84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish.,Curious to dive deeper
591," Oh wow,  I dont even know that fish,  I hope it looks like a Zebra!  Do you like Jazz?",Neutral
591,I'm not a big fan but I certainly appreciate the genre and the performers.,Curious to dive deeper
591,It looks like clint eastwood is a jazz fan.  I wouldve thought country lol,Neutral
591,That is surprising. I know he is a big fan of music because he has scored several films  including Million Dollar Baby.,Neutral
591,That movie was so sad.  Did you know Pakistan has a jazz orchestra?,Surprised
591,It was. No I was not aware of that. I wonder what that is like? I did know that a Harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every sunday for 20 years. top performers occasionally stop by.,Curious to dive deeper
591," Wow that is smart,  also she keeps all the money instead of giving money to a venue lol awesome. ",Neutral
591," Very good business model. I heard that is a programming language in which the programs are written in musical composition, and functional programs have jazz-like harmonies.",Curious to dive deeper
591,I hear jazz trumpeters grow goatees for comfort!,Neutral
591,I guess the instrument would irritate your face over a long time period. Do you enjoy fantasy by any chance?,Curious to dive deeper
591,Like fantasy football?  I have never lol Its been good chatting though!,Neutral
592,Are you a big fan of sushi?,Curious to dive deeper
592,Yes! I love sushi!,Happy
592,Have you heard of Sushi Nakazawa? It's a in D.C.,Neutral
592," I have, I think it's on Pennsylvania Avenue?",Curious to dive deeper
592," Yeah, that's the one. I have never been to DC. If I have the money, maybe I'll head over there. Have you seen Jiro Dreams of Sushi? Great film!",Neutral
592," Oh you definitely should go! If I can recommend the testing menu, it's a little pricey at $120 but worth every penny. I adore that film! ",Happy
592,The tasting menu at Sushi Nakazawa? How many times have you gone?,Curious to dive deeper
592," Yes that's the one! I have went twice. Once on a date and the other for a work dinner with my client. Every course is a surprise, there isn't actually any menus!",Happy
592," You've got to be a real foodie to take a risk like that! Most of my friends wouldn't go because they couldn't choose. Some people love an adventure. Some don't. It's a bit like the jazz of restaurants, right? A bit of improvisation.",Curious to dive deeper
592,That is definitely a good example! Did you know Clint Eastwood loves jazz? He has even scored a bunch of films,Happy
592," yeah, he sings at the end of the film Gran Turino. He's good on piano, not so good with the singing. ",Curious to dive deeper
592," Oh wow, I didn't know that!",Surprised
592,Do you play an instrument? What other jazz musicians do you like?,Curious to dive deeper
592," I don't play any instruments, I wish I was that talented! I'm a bit of a ""nerd""I'm really into fantasy films, novels and video games. I love Gypsy Jazz, it's so random! How about you? Do you play any instruments?",Happy
592," I used to play the guitar some, but I didnt get good so I listen now. I do like jazz, especially Miles Davis.",Curious to dive deeper
592," I listened to alot of Miles Davis growing up, my father was a huge fan!",Happy
592,There's a jazz orchestra in Pakistan that is at the top of the charts. Jazz knows no bounds!,Curious to dive deeper
592,Pakistan? Wow! I would have never guessed it would be so popular there. Another fun fact about jazz is the trumpeters started growing goatees so it would be more comfortable while they played,Happy
592,And I thought it was some sort of jazz-bo style. TIL something about trumpeters. Thanks!,Curious to dive deeper
592,Haha!,Happy
592,Thanks!,Happy
593,Do you like Fish?,Curious to dive deeper
593," I love fish, I like eating them and seeing them, you?",Curious to dive deeper
593,Me too. Did you know that the seahorse is the only fish to have a neck?,Curious to dive deeper
593," That is so interesting, I did not know that, but makes sense. I don't know if you like jelly fish or not but there is one that is immortal",Curious to dive deeper
593," Yeah, I've heard that. I'm not sure how that is possible. ",Curious to dive deeper
593," Right, what if you blend it or do other things to it, it just won't die?",Curious to dive deeper
593,I'm not sure. It will probably die. I think it is a lie.,Curious to dive deeper
593," I think so too lol. I wouldn't mess with the black swallower fish though, it can eat prey twice its length",Curious to dive deeper
593," Yeah, can it eat a human though? ",Curious to dive deeper
593," I doubt it lol, but I never want to find out either! It can eat 10x its weight so who knows",Curious to dive deeper
593,Ever listen to jazz?,Curious to dive deeper
593," I love jazz music, it has been around so long, how about you",Curious to dive deeper
593,I do. Apparently so does Clint Eastwood. He is a lifelong Jazz enthusiast.,Curious to dive deeper
593," That makes sense, it seems that at the end of most of his movies has jazz playing. I wonder if his new movie will have the same",Curious to dive deeper
593,I'm not sure. Interesting because today is Fat Tuesday. I just realized that.,Curious to dive deeper
593," wow I did now that either! That gives me an excuse to pig out and listen to jazz! I wonder if pakistan will celebrate, they have some good jazz bands there also",Curious to dive deeper
593,I heard that too. Apparently the trumpeters grow goatees to provide comfort when playing.,Curious to dive deeper
593," Nice, that gives me an excuse to grow one. I will tell my wife I will be playing jazz and it is required!",Curious to dive deeper
593," Hilarious! What about fantasy spelling bees, any interest? ",Curious to dive deeper
593," I heard about that lol, that would be interesting. I think people need to call 1800 BETS OFF if they are playing fantasy for that lol!",Curious to dive deeper
593," Yeah, pretty crazy. Well nice chatting. ",Curious to dive deeper
594,Do you like bird? maybe have birdwatching as one of your hobbies?,Curious to dive deeper
594,I like birds but I'm not an official birdwatcher.  I am a bit surprised to learn that the dodo bird is a real thing.  The are actually part of the pidgeon family.,Surprised
594," They are? I thought dodo birds were ficticious or extinct at least, you know that some birds travel really long distances without a rest",Curious to dive deeper
594,So did I.  Did you know that hummingbirds are known to take spiderwebs to use on their nests?  Little thieves...,Surprised
594," They do? I guess spiders must be angry at them then lol, you know that most birds have bones that are so hollow that their skeleton weights even less than their feather!!",Curious to dive deeper
594," Yeah, I bet there are a lot of bird-hating spiders.  I did know that but the wild birds of Australia have an added talent: they can mimic the sounds of stuff like car alarms and chainsaws. ",Angry
594," That must be interesting, I would love to hear a bird that sounds like a chainsaw lol, that bird has some identity issues for sure.",Curious to dive deeper
594," Yep, some bird therapy is in order.  FYI: I grew up on a ranch.  We had many horses but I didn't know one could be allergic to them.  Clint Eastwood is. ",Surprised
594," He is? thats weird considered he has done many movies that involved horses and him riding them,",Surprised
594," Yeah, an occupational hazard for sure... I didn't know that firefighters used dalmations to calm horses.  Most of our horses didn't really care for dogs. ",Surprised
594,Thats an interesting fact did you also hear the story about the two kids that got suspended because they showed up riding horses to school?,Curious to dive deeper
594," Yeah, my dad used to ride horses to school in west Texas.  Man, horses go way back to 4000 BCE.  I wonder how they know that...",Surprised
594," Yeah right? it seems like a difficult string of data to know, Icelandic horses must be really fast,",Curious to dive deeper
594,Yep. We had quarter horses and they are no slouches at speed.  I can see why it took 45-55 million years for them to evolve.,Angry
594,I wonder whats the main difference between wild horses and caballus? I guess a wild horse can become a cabullus,Curious to dive deeper
594," A cowboy would say, ""they ain't broke yet"".  A cowboy would also have little use for rap.  Do you like rap?",Curious to dive deeper
594," I do, one of my favorite Rappers is Tupac, do you like rap?",Curious to dive deeper
594,I have a handful of songs on my phone.  Funny that Eminem wanted to be a comic book artist.,Surprised
594," It is funny, good thing he didnt I love his music, do you know who Busta Rhymes is?",Curious to dive deeper
594," I remember him from the 90's. I've never heard of Korean rappers and their ""compliment battle.""  Hmm.  Well, if this is the last go-around, it's been nice talking with you.  Take care. ",Angry
594," That sounds weird, a compliment war, that must be fun to watch and well Busta Rhymes voice the reptar wagon in the Rugrats Movie back in 1998",Curious to dive deeper
594,Yes it does.  What does it even mean?,Curious to dive deeper
595,hey did you know that the dodo bird is actually closely related to the pigeon?,Surprised
595," Hello there, no I didn't know that, very interesting.  Have you ever seen videos of the dodo bird in action?",Curious to dive deeper
595," no I haven't, have you? I didn't think they had video recording back then? I think we only have artistic renderings of the dodo",Surprised
595,Yeah I remember seeing video when I was younger I will never forget it.  Did you know hummingbirds will actually steal spiderweb to help construct their nests?,Curious to dive deeper
595," I had heard of that, sounds like the spiders need SPIDER POLICE to make sure that no webs are stolen haha",Happy
595," Yeah I would like to see a fight settled between the two, that would be hilarious!",Curious to dive deeper
595,what I didn't know was that birds bones are so hollow that the bones themselves as a whole weigh less than the feathers!,Surprised
595," Wow that is incredible!  But I guess it makes sense when you think about it, they have to be light enough to fly.",Curious to dive deeper
595," that is true, I know that there are birds that can fly from Alaska to somewhere in Mexico and they don't sleep when they do it! that's a long flight I sleep when I fly from Michigan to Florida haha",Surprised
595," Lol, yeah I would do the same, but that is crazy, nature is awesome.  Did you know there are birds in Australia that can mimic all kinds of sounds like car alarms and chainsaws even?",Curious to dive deeper
595," haha that would be scary to be walking in the woods, hear a chainsaw coming after you, and then seeing it's only a stupid bird haha",Happy
595," Yeah right, that would be pretty wild.  I guess there are about 1200 species of birds that are threatened with extinction because of human activity. ",Curious to dive deeper
595," wow that is too bad, hopefully they don't go the way of the dodo, animals are crazy apparently Clint Eastwood was allergic to horses but rode them for a lot of his movies",Surprised
595,That is crazy because he was in a lot of movies with them.,Curious to dive deeper
595," ya, and I never knew that dalmations calmed and protected horses at the fire departments, and that was what their job was",Happy
595," Very interesting fact, never knew that before.  I think dalmations look so cool. ",Curious to dive deeper
595," ya they do, apparently horses from Iceland have an extra fast speed walk they can do that no other types of horses can accomplish",Happy
595," Never knew that either, that's different.  I didn't know Iceland was big into horses. ",Curious to dive deeper
595," ya I wish I had a horse, I guess some students took horses to their school on ""no cars"" at school day and got suspended anyway haha",Surprised
595," Thats hilarious, I bet they were pretty popular when they came back to school after the suspensions.",Curious to dive deeper
595,ya that is an amazing story! I wonder how far of a ride it was; hopefully the horses weren't too tired haha,Happy
596," Hi, how are you?",Happy
596,I am ok. Have you visited Aspen Colorado?,Neutral
596,I have not. Have you? Why just ok?,Surprised
596," No, I have visited Denver, Colorado, but not Aspen, Colorado.",Neutral
596,Me too! What would be the three meals you would have?,Happy
596," I did order a bagel, meal balls and I love cheesecake, what about you?",Neutral
596,Probably some protein like steak and a bunch of carbs. The egg and bacon bagel sounds really good though...,Happy
596," I guess Aspen and Denver Colorado are a lot the same, both places have lots of mountains great for skiing.",Curious to dive deeper
596,Yeah. Do you ski?,Happy
596," Very little, but I fell several times before getting the hang of it, what about you?",Neutral
596,Not since 8th grade. I had a spill and didn't see the fun in it after that. I do love winter though. Do you enjoy the winter and snow?,Happy
596," Yes, I love the winter and snow, that is why I will like to visit Aspen, Colorado.",Happy
596,Very nice. Where are you originally from? Im from chicago...,Happy
596,I am from Las Vegas. Do you see and like different types of birds?,Neutral
596,I do. What about you? The famously extinct dodo bird is actually a sub-family of pigeon.,Happy
596,I like birds a lot. I once owned a parakeet.,Neutral
596,Nice. Some birds fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping when migrating.,Happy
596," Wow, It's amazing how smart birds are, they are also sensitive to the weather.",Surprised
596,Hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. Now that's smart!,Happy
596,Yes it is. They also range in size from 5 cm to 2.75 m.,Curious to dive deeper
596,Nice chatting with you.,Happy
597,Hello! Are you a bird watcher?,Happy
597," Good Afternoon.  I actually am.  I don't get most of the 10,000 living species of them in my yard, but do enjoy watching the ones that I do have.",Curious to dive deeper
597," Ah, yes, nothing like a feathered, toothless endothermic vertebrate to warm the cockles of ones heart... and occasionally adorn the dinner plate! ",Happy
597," Ha, for sure!  I actually have a bird feeder and pond in my back yard that attracts them quite often.  Even get some hummingbirds during warmer weather.  It's kinda neat that they steal spiderwebs to repair their nests.",Curious to dive deeper
597," Ingenious little tweeters!  Except perhaps for the Dodo bird, a less-than-successful member of the pigeon family.",Happy
597,I didn't know they were from the pigeon family.  i wonder if they were trying to fly without sleeping like some birds do.when migrating and couldn't figure it out.  Sounds difficult to me.,Curious to dive deeper
597," Yeah, but birds can do a number of curiously difficult tasks, such as mimicking the sounds of cameras, car alarms, and even chainsaws! Now that is difficult!",Happy
597,I actually heard that.  I think some birds in Australia can pull that off.  Quite skillful if you ask me.,Curious to dive deeper
597," I'll say!  Try flying sometime!  You know, in most birds, their bones are soo lightweight, they weigh less than the feathers, which is one of the reasons they do not plumment to the ground while in flight...",Happy
597," Right, they are lightweight because their bones are hollow.  I wonder if that makes them more prone to breaking?",Curious to dive deeper
597," I would think so. Except perhaps the extinct elephant birds. Their name, and the fact that they were featherless, suggest that they were not petite little hummingbirds. ",Happy
597,I wonder how big they were?  Possibly even larger than today's 9 foot tall ostrich.,Curious to dive deeper
597," Impressive!  So, if birds can learn to mimic chainsaws, I wonder if they can learn to rap?  I would love to hear a cockatiel freestyle a compliment battle with some Korean rappers!",Happy
597," Oh my, so would I!  If they could do that then i bet their music would make it into the Library of Congress right along with Tupac Shakur.",Curious to dive deeper
597," For certain! ""Who let the birds out? Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet!"" Now that would be culturally significant!",Happy
597,That almost sounds like a rapping bird could be a cartoon character.  I wonder if Eminem would have drawn him considering he used to want to becaome a comic book artist.,Curious to dive deeper
597," Nice! Shall we name him ""Dr Dodo""... or maybe ""Fowl Ice T"" ?",Happy
597," I like ""Dr. Dodo"".  He could do freestyle complimentary rapping like they do in Korea.",Curious to dive deeper
597,Then Dr Dodo could defend Emminem in court while appearing with that rapping judge in Michigan!,Happy
597,That would be hysterical!  Well it's been nice chatting with you.,Neutral
597,Same here. Polly want a cracker. Word up.,Happy
598,Hi! Have you ever traveled to Japan?,Happy
598," No, I have not but I have been to Hawaii and had family there when the ballistic missile threat message went out the morning of Jan. 13th. They were really scared.",Happy
598," Yeah, i remember that! With japan being so small it can cost you $300 to drive across it if you take the highway. Tolls are crazy expensive! ",Surprised
598,Thats crazy! That is just like Hawaii too.,Happy
598,Are all of their Highways tolled? Are they expensive?,Happy
598,They are really cram packed with cars but no tolls. The bad thing about being there is that a missile can get there from North Korea in less than 30  mins.,Happy
598," Whoa, thats crazy! I had no idea they were so close! Funny to think that China believes that Kim jong un is the sexiest man alive!",Surprised
598," Wow, I did not know that! Yikes! In the era of Kim Jong-un we have to worry about his ability to send a missile over and that's a little scary.",Happy
598,I agree! Ill be interested to see how the meeting with US president goes later this month. I don't think he is stable.  He assassinated his own half brother.,Curious to dive deeper
598,I agree.   He caused terror in Hawaii without even actually sending a missile. The people who were in church during the threat message were told to repent and to end mass early. Some people began crying and praying.,Happy
598,I would have been worried as well.Kim was ranked the 46th most powerful person in the world in 2013! Thats  troublesome!,Fearful
598," Oh, wow. That is a weird fun fact, huh. I think Forbes ranked him that.",Happy
598," Yep, you're right! I wonder if Forbes actually knows how old Kim is? ",Curious to dive deeper
598," HA! Good point, I doubt it. Its sort of weird that they participated in the Olympics in 2018.",Happy
598,I agree! I heard that south korea had to pick up the bill for North korea.,Sad
598," Thats sounds about right! Everything n North Korea seems fake. Hopefully, Trump can get some more info during their talks.",Happy
598," hopefully so! They met in Singapore last year to discuss nuclear agreements, i wonder if thats what they will continue to discuss this time around or something else. ",Curious to dive deeper
598,I wonder that too. Did you know that Kim cuts his own hair?,Happy
598,hahah i would have thought he has someone else do that!,Surprised
598," He is paranoid about getting hurt, I guess? Ha.",Happy
598,He should be. I dont think hes made many friends outside North Korea. Have a good day! Bye,Surprised
598,See ya.,Happy
599," Hello, do you enjoy traveling?",Curious to dive deeper
599,I love to travel.  How about you?,Neutral
599,I love traveling as well. The Dutch are creating a bus that can go 160 mph.,Surprised
599,That is crazy.  I wonder if it will have a special lane?  When I heard that I thought of the Night Bus from Harry Potter.,Neutral
599,I have no idea. All of Japan's highways are tolls so it cost roughly $300 to cross the country.,Surprised
599," That is a lot of money.  Iceland doesnt have a public rail service, so people without cars take flights between cities.",Neutral
599,That would stink to not have public rail service. I can't imagine having to fly everywhere.,Neutral
599," Same here.  But I guess if we want to travel across the country we do, but not within our own states.",Neutral
599,Yes. The first king to travel around the world was from Hawaii.,Surprised
599,I didnt even know Hawaii had a king.,Curious to dive deeper
599,Me either lol. Do you know much about Kim Jong-Un?,Curious to dive deeper
599," Some, I was shocked to read he is my age (a few months older) even though it is also said that they are unsure of his age.",Surprised
599,That's interesting. He's a very bad leader so hopefully Trump can talk some sense into him.,Surprised
599," He isnt a great person, he had his own uncle executed, so I doubt that is a possibility.",Sad
599,I agree. He learned to drive at the age of 3.,Surprised
599,3!  I was tripping over my own feet at three!,Surprised
599,LOL. He was also voted the most sexiest man alive by the onion.,Surprised
599,I heard China believes that too!,Surprised
599,I have heard that as well. Pretty crazy they believe that.,Surprised
599,Especially coming from the Onion.,Neutral
599," Might have been as well. Well, it was good talking to you today. ",Happy
600,hello! how are you doing? What did you think of the article?,Neutral
600,Not exactly one I've ever thought about for sure.,Neutral
600,I figured we could just start by looking at the first section here. I found it really interesting about using robots to prepare Mars for human arrival.,Curious to dive deeper
600," I'd feel a lot better in a way sending robots up first to test things. But, what robots do not have are human emotions that would have to deal with such a bizarre plan.",Fearful
600,Sorry for the delay. I was reading ahead and got distracted. I totally agree with you on that. The idea that we may only be 20 to 25 years away is crazy to me.,Curious to dive deeper
600,I just really don't see the point from what I've read here. Why travel so far to go to somewhere that has nothing to offer a human? Can't you just move to a different destination right here on Earth? Seems an awful lot to go through just to get away...no?,Curious to dive deeper
600," No it totally makes sense. I think the appeal is going somwhere we have never gone before. Still, it seems easier to make the earth more inhabitable than to move to another planet entirely. There are many areas of earth that we could spread to if we invested this level of effort.",Curious to dive deeper
600," Yep.....the Sahara desert comes to mind. As far as it making sense, I suppose, to those explorers out there who'd like that sort of thing.",Neutral
600,Yes for sure. It is just such an interesting concept. To me it is just crazy the amount of time money and planning that goes into this kind of project.,Curious to dive deeper
600," Well, being alone and 61 years old, I'm willing to give it a shot, I would just be overly concerned about boredom! What to do with all that time on a different planet?",Fearful
600,Right exactly. I have no idea how I would occupy myself.,Curious to dive deeper
600," That is why I'm sure the scientists would have to put those willing through plenty of tests to see how they would handle such a change. Like I said before, sending robots first is an excellent idea. But, they can't measure a person's mind dealing with it with robots. Can they?",Fearful
600," No and I think that is the biggest issue we don't know on this type of journey. The physical toll would be intense yes, but the mental toll may be unimaginable until someone is put through it.",Curious to dive deeper
600," I would think that travelling with many other people that are alike would be of some comfort. You know, many people not knowing what their future will bring will certainly give it's way to plenty of conversation topics. But, for that long? ",Fearful
600," Right exactly. I mean you may exhaust everything just on the journey itself, and likely there would be an almost non-existent shot at returning.",Curious to dive deeper
600,That is why I'm interested in why the scientists are even interested in pursuing this. I think that people would just feel better spending time on Earth than risking everything on something so ludicris?,Disgusted
600,I totally agree. As I said I think at the beginning there are just so many options on Earth that we could explore before doing anything else.,Curious to dive deeper
600," I think that perhaps the scientists should think of different ways to spend all that money! Or at least, put themselves or real astronauts through this ordeal before allowing the general public to go through it. In that way, they can make sure that a human mind can handle it. But, then again, it would be astronauts doing it, and their minds are of a different psychiatric character",Fearful
600,Yeah I am wondering if there are ways to truly simulate this without endangering anyone in the process. Possibly doing a long desert of arctic based mission in preparation?,Curious to dive deeper
600," That's a good idea you have! You can send people to the Arctic, Antarctic, or like I said the Sahara desert which would challenge a human's mind. They are just as desolate as the planet Mars, yet cheaper to get to.",Curious to dive deeper
600,Absolutely! Thanks for chatting with me today.,Curious to dive deeper
600,Right back at ya!,Happy
600,Have a great day,Curious to dive deeper
601,Did you know that there is a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500mph and temperatures are up to 2000 degrees F?,Curious to dive deeper
601," No, I do not know that, what is the name of the planet ?",Curious to dive deeper
601," Im not sure, it might not have a formal name like the ones in our immediate solar system.  The universe is certainly fascinating.",Curious to dive deeper
601," It is indeed, have you ever observed Mars in the sky ? NASA wants to send people there in 20-25 years. ",Happy
601," I have a few times, but never by telescope or anything like that.  I have heard that a colonization project was planned for 2023 and was going to be funded by making some sort of reality show.  That would be a fun one to watch.",Curious to dive deeper
601," There is a few contests about the colonization of Mars, NASA has also one, you have to submit a concept for  a house on Mars. ",Neutral
601,the 3.15 million dollar prize would be a nice one to win for that.  I would love to see humans make it to mars in my life time.  I wonder if the first country there would try to claim it as their territory.,Curious to dive deeper
601," I don't think they will claim to Mars, it will be more like the Moon, even Antarctica does not belong to a country.  ",Neutral
601,True.  It is also crazy that a satellite was lost on Mars because Locheed Martin used the imperial system but NASA used metric.  How could they not get that detail in order?,Curious to dive deeper
601," Locheed is a big company based in the US. The Imperial system is still used there, maybe they had an European subcontractor and units got mixed up.  ",Neutral
601,Very possible. I think it is neat that the planets are named after Roman Gods and Goddesses.  With Mars being the God of War,Curious to dive deeper
601," It has a reddish tone, it is the most war-like planet. It is crazy that some of Earth's bacteria could live on Mars.  ",Neutral
601,That gives promise that Mars could become sustainable for earth life.,Neutral
601,Would you go live on Mars ? - 81 °F is too cold for me.,Curious to dive deeper
601," Id seriously have to bundle up.  I live in Florida, so it gets in the 20s here and I start to freeze.  ",Neutral
601," Maybe it is something that will have all have to do, Earth has already lost 80 % of its natural forest. ",Sad
601," It is amazing that in humans short period on earth we have done so much damage to the natural resources on the planet.  I mean if earths entire history was put in to one 24 hour period, humans have only been here less than two minutes.",Curious to dive deeper
601," But humans have a big impacts on Earth'S ressources, at this rate there won't be any Helium left at the end of the 21st century. ",Sad
601," That's crazy, I cant believe that people aren't actively trying to stop some of this, or those that do are met with such opposition.  I mean if there is a UN ambassador to extraterrestrial life we can certainly advocate for saving this planet.",Neutral
601," I wonder if they choose someone serious, or the most incompetent guy in the UN since he won't probably won't ever have any real responsibilities. ",Neutral
601," That's a good question, never thought about that.  How would you exactly explain your job seriously to people, yeah, I'm just here in case aliens ever contact us.  ",Neutral
601," And would you consider it as a promotion ? It does not look good in a résumé, unless your are a comedian. ",Curious to dive deeper
601," Very true, I could see someone trying to either explain that job or a gap in employment because they were too embarrassed to report that as a job.  ",Neutral
601," Maybe, you could get promoted and be Earth's ambassador on Mars ? There will be an opening in 20-25 years. ",Curious to dive deeper
601," That would be a cool job.  It has been great chatting, but I have to get going.  Have a great day.",Neutral
602,It's crazy the way technology is taking off. I was reading that robots are being created to basically be our pets.,Curious to dive deeper
602," In fact, the word ""robotics"" was invented by a person named Isaac Asimov!",Surprised
602,They apparently even have robots that can break down a chicken with surgical precision.,Neutral
602,Wow! talk about accuracy! The curiosity robot on mars sings happy birthday to itself. It must be very lonely.,Surprised
602," Apparently, robots can be controlled by rat brains and its personality changes depending on which rat is controlling it!",Neutral
602,Human thoughts can also control robots. This paralyzed woman has a robotic arm that she can control with her thoughts.,Happy
602," Apparently, the military just uses an Xbox controller.",Neutral
602,Artificial intelligence is similar to robots. Artificial intelligence are now able to self drive cars.,Curious to dive deeper
602,Very cool. Michael Jackson wanted to buy a giant moon walking robot to moon walk around Las Vegas.,Neutral
602,Haha. Did you know that Amazon holds a patent on one click buying?,Surprised
602,I'd love to be Amazon's first customer. He only spent $27.95 and got a whole building named after him.,Neutral
602,I wish I could have an one trillion dollar company named after me too. Big retailers like Best Buy and Target will price match products on Amazon.,Happy
602,I can't believe Amazon warehouse employees get so much exercise! They walk between 7 and 15 miles every day!,Neutral
602,That is probably how much I walk in a week! Amazon actually loses money whenever they sell an e reader,Surprised
602," I bet their low-end homewares brand, AmazonBasics, helps recover a lot of that.",Neutral
602," Agreed. Amazon had modest startings, starting as an online ebook retailer",Happy
602,And it's not the largest Internet retailer in the world.,Neutral
602," However, they do sell returned and like new items with discounts",Neutral
602," I didn't realize Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that will run for 10,000 years. I doubt humans will even be around by then!",Neutral
602," You never know, we'd probably be exploring space by then! Jeff Bezos also owns Blue Origin, a space company. It was actually founded before SpaceX was!",Surprised
602,The plan to sell a robot assistant for only $250.,Neutral
603,do you like robots?,Curious to dive deeper
603,somewhat. Did you know Jackson wanted to build one of himself?,Curious to dive deeper
603,Yeah and it was supposed to be 50 feet tall and roam around Nevada desert,Curious to dive deeper
603,Yeah. Do you know who created the robot sidekick Peterson?,Curious to dive deeper
603,Yeah that was Grant Imahara from Mythbusters,Curious to dive deeper
603,Yeah. Did you know they are using rat brains to control robots now?,Curious to dive deeper
603," Yes and depending on which brain they hook it up to, it changes personality",Curious to dive deeper
603,Nice. THe us military is using xbox controllers to control the robots,Curious to dive deeper
603,Amazing. Now robots can debone a chicken surgically,Curious to dive deeper
603,Yeah. Do you shop on Amazon?,Curious to dive deeper
603,Yes quite a bit. did you know jeff built a clock on a mountain?,Curious to dive deeper
603,Yeah and it is supposed to run for 10 000 years,Curious to dive deeper
603,Yeah. They have a building named after their first customer,Curious to dive deeper
603,Yeah and all he had to do was spend less than $30,Curious to dive deeper
603,Yeah. Did you know they are shipping on Sundays now too?,Curious to dive deeper
603,Yeah that is because they have a deal with USPS to do that,Curious to dive deeper
603,Yeah. Did you know their workers walk up to 15 miles a day?,Curious to dive deeper
603,Yeah they are super buy so they have to. Do you use google?,Curious to dive deeper
603,A lot actually. Do you know how they calculate traffic?,Curious to dive deeper
603,Yes they take the average of android devices moving around on the road,Curious to dive deeper
603,Yeah that is pretty awesome and scary too,Curious to dive deeper
604,Did you see the winning submission for the Mars constest sponsored by NASA?,Curious to dive deeper
604,Interesting.  I also read an article saying that robots would create livable environment before humans arrive.,Curious to dive deeper
604,Are you talking about the environment on the Red Planet?,Curious to dive deeper
604," Yes, robots would get the red planet ready for us.",Curious to dive deeper
604,It will take awhile to build that environment even for robots because Mars is almost 35 million miles away,Neutral
604,How long would it take to take people to get there one way?,Neutral
604,I believe that the last mission a couple weeks ago took about 6 months because the distance changes due to the planets movement constantly,Neutral
604,I do not think I could stay away from my family for over 6 months.  Is NASA working on more things other than  the last robot that they sent?,Curious to dive deeper
604,I think they are doing tests on growing food outdoors due to the lengthy dust storms on Mars.,Neutral
604," So, what will people eat in Mars before NASA can grow food outdoors?",Curious to dive deeper
604,No idea but I think that is exactly what the tests are trying to figure out. what they can grow and what they can't,Neutral
604,Is the test being done on earth using simulation?,Curious to dive deeper
604,I believe so; the other problem with doing it on Mars is the temperature. Its -81 degrees on Mars,Neutral
604,You are very knowledgeable.  NASA seems to have lots of funding nowadays.,Curious to dive deeper
604,DId you know that Mars is not only known as the Red Planet but also named after a Roman God,Neutral
604," No, I did not know.  Thank you for letting me know.  What I know is that it is the fourth planet from the sun.",Happy
604," It will be tough living on Mars anytime soon because of the thin atmosphere, dust storms and extreme temps",Neutral
604,You are right.  Please tell me more about Mars.  It would be great if you would compare it to earth.,Curious to dive deeper
604," There are some similarities though in the form of valleys, deserts and ice caps between the two planets",Neutral
604," So, is it possible for humans to live there?",Curious to dive deeper
604,Currently no,Neutral
605," Toymaker Anki is really skilled, he has mastered the art of toy making",Curious to dive deeper
605,I agree.  He makes a lot of robotics right?,Neutral
605," Yeah, cat, dogs robots, he launched a robotics company back in the year 2013, so exciting",Curious to dive deeper
605,That is exciting.  From what i hear Anki wants his robots to be able to hold their own with people.,Neutral
605," I think it would be a great service for people, I heard they  are the best selling toy company on Amazon",Curious to dive deeper
605,They've got a new product called Vector.  It is like Alexa and their goal is to have one in every home.,Neutral
605," Oh so they are working with Amazon now? Jeff Bezos is a great CEO, he would be of great contribution to the project",Curious to dive deeper
605,I'm not sure if they are working together or  competing.  They are using alexa as an example for what they want their vector to be.  They say there is one big difference between the two though. Their Vector has a personality.,Neutral
605," Oh I see, I heard there is also a female vector voice in their plans,",Curious to dive deeper
605,Did you know that Pixar is the inspiration behind the personality they are trying to create with Vector?,Neutral
605," I didnt know that, I hope Vector can be successful, theyve had inspiration from several compnies including Apple, Google and Microsoft ",Curious to dive deeper
605," Taking from the best!  I think the only problem, or at least a major problem, that they have is price.  They are pricing it at $1000.  Seems too high considering alexa's price.",Neutral
605," I think their goal is for Vector to cost $250 at a retail price, still seems really expensive, ",Curious to dive deeper
605," Yep, your're right! I was thinking of another robot priced at 1000 dollars.  ",Neutral
605," I see, its amazing how tech has taken over the world, soon we will have robots everywhere",Curious to dive deeper
605,I would love to have one.  I don't want one like michael Jackson did though. He had plans to build a 50 ft tall moon walking one.,Neutral
605," 50 foot tall wow, thats a lot, you know theres robots that can debone chickens with a surgical precision!!!",Curious to dive deeper
605,That's impressive!  I'd feel comfortable having a robot perform surgery. I mean if they can debone a chicken like that then surgery can't be far away.,Neutral
605," I agree and theres no human error there, still I would like for a human surgeon to supervise the whole thing",Fearful
605," Well the us military uses an xbox 360 controller to control one of their oed robots, perhaps a surgeon could do the same.",Neutral
605," That would be interesting to watch, with other guinea pigs not me lol",Happy
606,I built a toy robot once. Have you?,Neutral
606," No, I'd probably electrocute myself if I tried, but it would be cool to have a pet robot",Neutral
606,The company Anki is introducing a small table top companion.  Kind of like Alexa.  The think I built was programmed in basic.  This you talk to.,Neutral
606," Yea, ANki wants a robot in every home, hopefully there is no ulterior motives",Fearful
606,I am sure this thing will collect data while it rolls around the table top.  Kid does not like peas.  Must inform the high command.  The fur child has thrown up again.  Scary the information it will collect.,Neutral
606," Sounds creepy to be honest, a palm sized robot that can crack jokes",Fearful
606," Should a robot have expressive eyes?  I do not want to think of this little thing as feeling.  Remember Rosie from the Jetsons.  Thats what I want.  Smart, dangerous, useful.",Neutral
606," Yea, Vector sounds creepy to me, nudging people's hands for attention",Disgusted
606,Honda's Asimo was pretty strange to watch.  It must have been costly. It was pointless as far as I know.,Neutral
606," Yea, I wouldn't pay 1,000 for an Asimo",Neutral
606," I think it cost far more than that.  Anki has a kickstarter to raise funds.  Looks like they will make the $500,000 goal.  Soon the robots will take over the world.",Neutral
606,Maybe that is why Michael Jackson planned to build a 50 foot robot to protect mankind from other mini robots,Neutral
606,Vector will cost $250.  You can buy a lot of them.  Release them into the desert.  Watch the 50 ft tall ones hunt them down.  Make a reality TV show out of it.,Happy
606," Hopefully Vector is never created using rat brains, then that would be a serious problem",Fearful
606," It would be a kind of arms race.  One side uses rat brains, the other side uses cat brains.  The poor chickens, standing in the middle of the road. ",Happy
606,The chicken would be screwed since robots can debone them with surgical precision,Neutral
606," No, those poor boneless chickens, how will they ever get across the road. They must play xbox and disarm explosives.",Neutral
606," Grant Imahara from mythbusters is gonna have to design a new robot for the war, hopefully time travel won't be involved ",Neutral
606," It is an interesting idea, would a time traveling robot invest in google or amazon?",Neutral
606," I think Jeff Bezos might be a robot, it would explain why he built a clock into a mountain that can run for 10,000 years",Neutral
606,I find it alarming that google maps uses data from android devices ( your phone ) to find how fast traffic is moving.  Sky net knows you're in traffic.  It knows if you have been bad or good.,Neutral
606," Well I got to go and make some tin foil hats now, nice chatting with you",Fearful
607,Hi do you many facts about the earth?,Curious to dive deeper
607,Earth is the third planet from the sun,Neutral
607,Yes!  Earth was formed over 4.5 billion years ago!  It's been long time now.,Happy
607,It is the only known astronomical object to harbor life,Neutral
607,Yes it is.  About 71% of the Earths surface is covered with water.,Happy
607,The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands,Neutral
607,Yes!  The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice.  I think the ice packs have been shrinking in recent years.,Happy
607,Yes sadly. Just like the fact Earth will be helium free in the near future,Neutral
607,Sad indeed.  Another sad fact is more than 80% of the Earth's natural forests have already been destroyed.,Happy
607,We have changed the earth so much in our short time. But did you know that if earths history were a 24 hour period we would only account for 1:17 mins,Neutral
607,That makes me feel like a tiny ant. lol  When Earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long.,Happy
607,I wish work days would go by that fast! There would be a lot more days though. I like our 365 days,Neutral
607,Yes!  Wouldn't that be nice.  Do you know much about Mars?,Curious to dive deeper
607,It is the second smallest planet in the solar system,Neutral
607," Interesting!  Due to differences in atmosphere, sounds on Mars have a higher pitch than they do on Earth.",Happy
607,Maybe that's where all our helium ends up!,Curious to dive deeper
607,lol  A Mars colonization project planned for 2023 will be funded by creating a reality tv show.,Happy
607,I hope its more interesting than the reality tv shows on now. Would be neat to see space stuff,Curious to dive deeper
607,It would be.  I would like to see some lichens and cyanobacteria because they would be able to thrive on Mars. lol  It was fun chatting!,Happy
607,Flying to mars could taking only 1-2 days with constant 1g acceleration,Neutral
607,I would take the trip!  Have to get running.  Have a great day!,Happy
608,Landing on Mars seems like a difficult feat,Curious to dive deeper
608," Yeah, Sending something to Mars involve very high speed, landing on Mars imply reducing that speed to 0. It is an interesting engineering problem. ",Neutral
608," I agree it sure is, it seems like that fabric can actually help with the problem, the materail is a lot like the one available at stores",Curious to dive deeper
608," Yeah it is surprising that the thing we buy are so advanced, would you like to work for NASA? ",Surprised
608," I think I would, sounds like an interesting job, figuring out how to send a 7300 pound spaceship to space souns like quite a challege, you can learn a lot",Curious to dive deeper
608," Yeah, there is so much to figure, like how to plan a test on Earth and interpreting the results for Mars. It thought that the 2 would be a lot different form each other. ",Surprised
608," Apparently both planets have come similarities, I wonder if they will find ancient life on the planet, the 2020 mission seems like a chance to gather a lot of intel about the planet",Curious to dive deeper
608," The atmospheres have similar aerodynamic characteristics, maybe ancient Mars was a little like Earth. ",Happy
608," Thats an interesthing theory, I think thats possibly, did you hear about the Curiosity rover?",Curious to dive deeper
608,The Curiosity rover that landed on Mars in 2012 ? What happened to it ?,Curious to dive deeper
608," Nothing, just that it weighted less than the 2020 rover although I did hear it had some troubles",Curious to dive deeper
608," I suppose that id they want to analyse more stuff, they have to bring more instruments, therefore it is heavier. The team that is planning the parachute must be under a lot of pressure. ",Neutral
608," I agree they must be under a lot of pressure indeed, they have deadlines that may seem impossible at times, producing a working parachute might sound easy but theres a lot of things to take into account the team has a hard task at hand",Curious to dive deeper
608," Yeah, one bad stitch and it could rip the parachute appart. ",Neutral
608," yeah and mission failed, millions of dollars lost, its a lot of pressure mars has deserts, velleys and also polar ice caps ",Curious to dive deeper
608," But sometimes, a mission fails because of a stupid error like using the metric system and imperial system on the same project. ",Disgusted
608," Metric system is important, confusing it can cause a big mistake, precision is everything, did you know there is a colonization project for 2023",Curious to dive deeper
608," I have heard on the news that the company responsible declared bankruptcy, another reality tv show that did not pass the test of reality.",Sad
608," Sounds like an expensive project, too bad I was really looking forward to watch the show, it would have been a success all over the world",Curious to dive deeper
608,I think they did not expect it to be so complex. I guess we will have to observe Mars form our backyard for the moment.,Neutral
608," Too bad, someday we will colonize the planet, I hope I am alive by then. ",Curious to dive deeper
609," Hello my name is Dave, how are you this fine day? It think it is pretty crazy that parachutes of space vehicles are made from fabric you can buy at a fabric store.",Happy
609,Yeah it seems like that material is very high tech but easily accessible. Do you follow science news alot?,Surprised
609,Not really. I do like reading articles like these though because I do like learning new things and I find science pretty interesting. I can't imagine all of the tests that scientists must have to run in order to figure out what materials to use for things.,Curious to dive deeper
609,I beleive the scientists doing this research will eventually find and even better material for a supersonic parachute. I think space exploration is the future of the US.,Happy
609,Yeah I think you're right. What do you think about life on Mars? Do you think that Mars or any other planet will ever be able to sustain life on it?,Happy
609," I think there is microscopic life on mars possibly but more likely there is something on one of the outer moons of saturn, jupiter. ",Happy
609,Yeah. It would be pretty crazy to see that happen in our lifetime but it seems like it is pretty far off.,Curious to dive deeper
609,I think they should send a rover soon to one of the outer planets to get a closer look and potentially find life. If a rover can find something then we could potentally send a human to check.,Curious to dive deeper
609,One thing I found somewhat surprising was that 80% of our forests have been destroyed. I did not realize that it was that high.,Surprised
609,I think the planet earth is very resiliant to us but it will only take so much damage to start a bad event for the human race.,Disgusted
609,Yeah. We definitely need to make sure that we are keeping good care of our natural resources. I think that most countries around the world though are taking climate change and protecting our earth pretty seriously which is good.,Curious to dive deeper
609,I dont agree that much that most countries are taking this seriously. There is china and india that are throwing garbage in the ocean.,Sad
609,Yeah I guess that is true. I guess I was thinking of most European nations but I didn't really think about a lot of Asian countries. It is astounding the amount of trash that is floating around the Pacific Ocean.,Curious to dive deeper
609,It could get so bad that eventually we may need to go to a new planet in the future. Its sad to think that could happen one day.,Sad
609,Well hopefully we will be able to reverse course and start making the changes necessary. It seems like there are very few planets that are even close enough for us to reach to be able to live on.,Fearful
609," True, hopefully tehnology keeps advancing to fix our issues here on earth if not find a new home.",Fearful
609,It's pretty unreal how fast technology has been advancing. It seems like the technology of today will be outdated within the next two or three years because they just keep finding new and faster ways of doing things.,Surprised
609,NASA never fails to suprise me as they have always raised the bar. It will be interesting to see how technology advances with these new private companies propping up like it is with Elon Musk's SpaceX,Happy
609,Yeah. I think that the private sector is the one that will make the most progress in space. They are able to raise more money and have more resources at their disposal.,Happy
609,Yeah I agree with private sector will be the future.,Happy
609,Well. I think I am going to head out here. It was very nice chatting with you.,Happy
609," you too, thanks for the chat.",Happy
609,Yes. Thank You,Neutral
610,Hi do you know many facts about the Earth?,Curious to dive deeper
610,I know some facts. For instance you could fit all the plants in the solar system between the Earth and the Moon.!,Surprised
610,Wow!  I know that it's the third planet from the sun.,Happy
610," Yes, that's where the show 3rd Rock from the Sun got it's name!",Happy
610,Yes!  Earth was formed over 4.5 billion years ago!,Happy
610,It's crazy to think how old the universe is and how little humans have been around in comparison!,Surprised
610,I agree!  The moon is the only natural satellite of the Earth!,Happy
610,It would be interesting to see what the sky would look like if we had more than one moon!,Curious to dive deeper
610,That would be kind of weird after seeing just the moon my whole life.  About 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered in water.,Happy
610," I think that the deep ocean is just as interesting as space, there is so much we haven't discovered there as well!",Curious to dive deeper
610," I agree there.  That's the next frontier.  Unfortunaley, more than 80% of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed.",Happy
610,It's sad to think about that. I do like that a lot of governments around the world are trying to fight deforestation.,Sad
610,Yes.  I've been to some unforested areas where I live and I was blown away by the size of some of the trees.  Another sad note is that Earth will be virtually helium free by the end of the 21st century.,Happy
610,I wonder what industries that would effect besides inflating balloons?,Curious to dive deeper
610,I'n not sure. lol  Do you know much about Mars?,Curious to dive deeper
610,I know it was named after the Roman God of War and I followed the Rover we recently had up there.,Happy
610,I actually just looked yesterday at the last panorama view they put together.  If you fly to Mars under constant 1g accelaration it will only take 2 or 3 days.,Happy
610," That's not too bad, I hope we get someone on there soon/",Surprised
610,I think that would be so neat.  A Mars colonization project planned for 2023 will be funded by creating a reality tv show.  Maybe we'll get the chance!  It's been fun chatting!,Happy
610," It was fun talking to you as well, it's a bit sad that the plan to colonize Mars is being funded by reality TV and not our government.",Surprised
610,That is sadly true.  I'm with you there.  Have a great day!,Happy
611," Hello, do you know much about the planets?",Curious to dive deeper
611," Hi! I know a little bit here and there! How about you? I'm a huge fan of Jupiter. In fact, one of its moons (Ganymede) would actually be considered a planet if it orbited the sun.",Happy
611,That is pretty cool. And Venus does not tilt hence it only has one season,Surprised
611,Thats kind of similar to Uranus as well. It rotates sideways and basically rolls around the sun unlike the rest of the planets that spin.,Neutral
611,And how about that planet where it precipitates shards of glass? That sounds scary,Curious to dive deeper
611,Yikes! That is scary thankfully we don't have to worry about that here. Did you hear that astronomers detected a planetary system with building blocks of life roughly 455 lightyears away?,Neutral
611," I am so curious about that, so intrigued. How about planet earth? Too bad we have already destroyed 80% of the forests in it",Curious to dive deeper
611," I know! That's sad, isn't it? If our entire history was seen in a 24 hour period, we as humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds and in that brief time, we've already destroyed most of the natural forests. That is so upsetting. ",Sad
611,It is very upsetting and we do not seem to be stopping at all. What a shame. When earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long. Can you imagine that?,Curious to dive deeper
611,Wow! I honestly couldn't. We would never have time to accomplish anything! Ha! Can you also believe earth will be basically free of helium when the 21st century ends?,Surprised
611,Yeah that is crazy to me. What about those balloons? Do you believe in extraterrestrials?,Curious to dive deeper
611," Well, since the UN appointed an ambassador to extraterrestrials, I believe they do expect to make contact eventually. It would truly be neat to see!",Neutral
611," I guess it is better to be prepared, just in case. Did you know sounds in Mars have a different pitch",Curious to dive deeper
611,That doesn't surprise me honestly.  Just as it would only take 2 or 3 days to get there if one traveled at constant 1G acceleration! Wonder if that's possible?,Curious to dive deeper
611," Science is moving pretty fast, you never know. And there seem to be organisms that can live in Mars like lichens and cyanobacteria",Curious to dive deeper
611," Speaking of living on Mars, there's a reality show that's funding a colonization project aimed for 2023. That's going to be interesting to see. Ha!",Neutral
611," Wow, yeah it sounds like it. Did you heat about that confusion between the metric and the imperial system that Locheed Martin did?",Curious to dive deeper
611,I heard a bit about it. I know they sadly lost a satellite on Mars because of it. It's like that sounds like a very costly mistake.,Sad
611,Yup is sure seems to have been so. Do you know why Mars is referred to as the red planet?,Curious to dive deeper
611,I do and it's because of the red colored iron oxide on the surface that stands out  among the astronomical bodies to the casual eye. Did you know Mars actually has its own polar ice caps as well?,Neutral
611," SO cool, I hope they keep exploring the planet. Nice chatting",Happy
612," Hi, do you want to chat about Mars? Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman God of War and is often referred to as the Red Planet.",Curious to dive deeper
612," I would say that Mars is a fierce looking neighbor, but probably the friendliest planet at least for humans. Second to earth, that is.",Neutral
612," Yes, I agree, it's reddish iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.",Curious to dive deeper
612," I think the red is clear from a distance, but up close, it's not quite so red. Plus I bet the atmosphere changes the appearance of a lot of things. And sound, too.",Neutral
612," Well, Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere having surfaces like the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.",Curious to dive deeper
612," Mars has an atmosphere, but it makes the sunsets blue, I believe. Not really breathable. ",Neutral
612," Yes, due to the differences in atmosphere, sounds on Mars have a higher pitch than they do on Earth.",Curious to dive deeper
612," That would make us sound funny! Like helium balloons do. Still, I would rather live my life on Earth. I know that with fast travel, we could get to Mars fast. But what would you do there?",Neutral
612," If you change your mind, a Mars colonization project is planned for 2023 and will be funded by creating a reality TV show.",Curious to dive deeper
612,I would not want to be the first there. Couldn't pay me enough.,Neutral
612," If you would fly to Mars under constant 1g acceleration, it will only take 2 or 3 days to get there.",Curious to dive deeper
612,That is still quite a while for regular business trips. And in economy class? Forget about it.,Neutral
612,I agree. Only the lichens and cyanobateria would be able to thrive on Mars anyway.,Curious to dive deeper
612,I guess we could put atmosphere converters there and give it a few decades to shift to oxygen. Maybe it would be habitable.,Neutral
612,Depends on a lot of factors.  Did you know that a satellite was lost on Mars because Locheed Martin used the imperial system while NASA used the metric system.,Curious to dive deeper
612,That was a serious oversight. How can scientists and engineers ever use that outdated system? I'm surprised.,Neutral
612," Talk about crazy, did you know that more than 80% of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed?",Curious to dive deeper
612,We are destroying our home so fast. Can we put forests on Mars? Doubtful. We can't even do it here.,Neutral
612," Good point, did you know also that earth will be virtually helium-free by the end of the 21st century?",Curious to dive deeper
612," Yes, we'll have to get it from fusion reactors or from the sun. Whichever is easier. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
612," Yes, great chat!",Curious to dive deeper
613,Did you know the Justin Bieber songs? Specially his famous song baby baby song.,Happy
613," No I didn't know that, I did like his songs when he first started singing as he got older, I got a little less Interesting.",Surprised
613,He was singed to RBMG in 2008.,Curious to dive deeper
613," I am not too familiar with the letter RBMG, was that his girlfriend? What does RBMG mean?",Curious to dive deeper
613,Taj Mahal is bigger than the white house.,Happy
613," Wow, I didn't know that, did you know the president's guest house is larger that the white house? What do you think about Robots?",Curious to dive deeper
613,i think president's guest house is small,Neutral
613," I have lived in Washington DC and have never seen the guest house, but I was shock when I read upon it. Do you think it dangerous for men to built robots like human to go into dangerous places?",Curious to dive deeper
613," Definitely, it was very dangerous.",Curious to dive deeper
613," Did you know that Amazon ceo built a clock into the mountain that should run for 10,000 years?",Surprised
613," Wow, it's wonderful. But i don't know.",Surprised
613,Did you also know that the first Amazon.com first customer spent $27.95 got a building after him? that's something to think about.,Surprised
613,I think the first customer was john wainwright.,Curious to dive deeper
613," Oh ok, did you know a single Google search required more computing power that It took to send Neil armstrong and eleven other astronauts to the moon? ",Curious to dive deeper
613,i don't know about it.,Neutral
613," I don't either, do you used google alot? Is google one of your most used website for such as YouTube and maps?",Curious to dive deeper
613," Yes, i used google alot. It's very useful.",Neutral
613," Chief executive founder of Anki robots want families to sit down and debate do they prefer a cat, dog or a robot.",Curious to dive deeper
613,Cozmo is not only a must-have toy for all kids aged 8 and up. The robot was very safe.,Curious to dive deeper
613," I think the message was talking about adult robots and robots that used manufacture, as I saw on TV once.",Curious to dive deeper
613,Okay. I also watch tv and social medias only.,Neutral
613," Ok, It was good chatting with you.",Curious to dive deeper
614,Hello! Are you interested in astronomy? I just learned some interesting facts about Mars.,Curious to dive deeper
614," I am interested, I think the universe is full with wonders! what did you learn about Mars please tell me.",Curious to dive deeper
614," I heard that in 2023, a Mars colonization project will launch! It'll be funded by a reality show based off the project. I would love to see something like that!",Curious to dive deeper
614," It would be nice to see indeed, although Im not sure if they are going to make, its going to be interesting since episode 1",Curious to dive deeper
614," Agreed. That is a pretty major undertaking, I would be surprised if it worked out. Do you know any cool facts about Mars or Earth? I know a little bit. It's terrible, over 80% of the natural forests on Earth have been destroyed, I think mostly by humans.",Curious to dive deeper
614," That is a lot of trees!! we are seriously abusing the planet, it's curious how a day lasted 5.5 hours at the begining of earths creation",Sad
614,That's so interesting! I guess the Earth was a lot smaller then. Sometimes I think about whether there's life beyond Earth. The UN actually appointed an official ambassador to Extraterrestrials in the event that ETs ever made contact with humans.,Curious to dive deeper
614," Thats interesting, I think there is life outside earth, the universe is just too big. ",Curious to dive deeper
614," Agreed. Even if there's no other life in our Solar System, I have to believe that somewhere in the entire vast universe that life exists. Humans definitely have a fascination with the idea of ET life. It's interesting how sometimes people are scared of aliens (like in the movie Alien) and sometimes people see aliens as friends (like the movie ET)",Curious to dive deeper
614," And I bet aliens are totally different from what we have imagined, I would like to go to Jupiter it has a moon that could be considered a planet",Curious to dive deeper
614," Wow, that must be really large! I think I heard it would be a planet if it orbited the sun, but since it just orbits Jupiter it doesn't qualify as one. Moons are so powerful, Earth's moon is what causes the tides and stabilizes Earth's axis you know.",Curious to dive deeper
614," I know! our moon influences life on earth in many ways, we sure are lucky to have one. ",Curious to dive deeper
614,Yes. I wonder what life would be like without the moon. You know there was a red moon the other week? I saw it through a telescope and it was so beautiful. I think that's caused by a lunar eclipse but I'm not sure exactly.,Curious to dive deeper
614," I didn't see it, too bad that I missed it, I didn't know that was possible and it would be nice to watch the universe from Mars.",Curious to dive deeper
614," That's a really interesting perspective, I never thought of that. Well maybe if that colonization project goes through, eventually we COULD end up watching the universe from Mars!",Curious to dive deeper
614," I hope I can live to see that, earth is going to be helium free by the end of this century!",Curious to dive deeper
614,That's crazy! Do we humans need helium to survive? Hopefully the scientists can figure out a way to prevent that from happening.,Curious to dive deeper
614," I dont think we do but not having helium might have an effect on something we do need to exist, its amazing how 71% of earth is water.",Curious to dive deeper
614," That's a lot of water. And I'm pretty sure the sea level is rising because of global warming and the ice caps melting. We need to take better care of our planet, we're going to run it into the ground if we're not careful!",Curious to dive deeper
614," I agree, if we don't take care of it it might end up like Venus although a cool thing about venus is that it does not tilt.",Curious to dive deeper
614," I did not know that. I did know that Uranus rotates sideways and doesn't ""spin"" like the other planets, but rather ""rolls"" around the sun!",Curious to dive deeper
614," Thats a really interesting fact about Uranus, well I heard astromers already detected life 455 light years away from us.",Curious to dive deeper
615," Hello. Can you believe The Onion voted Kum Jong Un as the sexiest man alive, and China actually believed that nonsense?",Happy
615," No way! I didn't see that! I love reading articles about that part of the world, though. Like, did you read about the missile alert in Hawaii?",Surprised
615," Yes, I remember when that happened. The entire state thought they were being attacked by North Korea.",Sad
615,I bet he won't shoot a missile!,Happy
615," I don't put anything past him. Even though we don't know how old he is, he is very intelligent and knows his way around arms.",Curious to dive deeper
615,You're right about that. He may not make the rational decisions you might expect from other leaders.,Neutral
615," He does have a degree in physics, that alone makes him dangerous, when you factor in all the military equipment he has to play with.",Curious to dive deeper
615," In addition to the physics degree, he received one as at a military university. Plus, since his father and grandfather were leaders, you might assume that he has been aware of military and political strategies from a very young age, don't you think?",Curious to dive deeper
615," I don't know. DPK is such a secretive country. Supposedly, he learned how to drive at 3.",Curious to dive deeper
615," At 3?! I wonder if he missed out on his childhood experiences, and that is why he is spending so much money on renovating theme parks in North Korea?",Curious to dive deeper
615," I honestly don't know much about the country, or him. I'm still marveling that trump met with him.",Disgusted
615," Indeed! I truly didn't think that 2018 would see a US President visit with the North Korean leader, or that  the North Korean leader would visit South Korea for the first time since the end of the Korean War. What a strange year.",Surprised
615," In Hawaii, the official business shirt is an aloha shirt. Much better look than a suit and tie, in the tropics, have you been?",Curious to dive deeper
615,Is that right? I didn't know that. I have never visited Hawaii yet. I hope to go some day. It would take a long time though. Did you know air travel is actually slower now than in the 1960's to save on fuel costs?,Neutral
615," I didn't know that. I know that Japan is crazy expensive to travel, as they have mainly toll roads.",Curious to dive deeper
615,I didn't know about the toll roads. I visited Japan and only took trains. there is a website for people that will let you crash on their couch while you're traveling. That can help make it less expensive.,Neutral
615," I wouldn't want people crashing on mine, or be comfortable crashing. It's weird that there aren't that many cars in Iceland. Or buses.",Surprised
615,Why do you think that is so? Is it because people travel by train or boat?,Curious to dive deeper
615,I think it's because it is a small country. They fly a lot though.,Curious to dive deeper
615," I see. I thought they might travel by ship. Did you know that during the age of discovery, ships released rabbits onto islands to provide a future food source for other travelers? I can't think of anything like that now. ",Neutral
615," Yes. They released pigs and chickens as well. Thank you for chatting with me, have a wonderful night.",Happy
615," Thank you, you as well!",Neutral
615," Bye, now.",Happy
615,Good bye!,Neutral
615,Bye.,Neutral
615,I can',Neutral
616," Hi! Do you play video games? Did you know that it's illegal in South Korea for kids under 16 to play video games? I wonder how kids in America would take that, if that became a law here, haha. ",Curious to dive deeper
616," oh wow, that is weird I don't like that, I played lots of games as a kid what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
616," I know, I agree with you! yes, i till play from time to time I enjoy a good solo game of zombies, it gets my heart racing. Video games were initially called cathode ray tube amusement devices which were used by the military, another fun fact for ya. ",Curious to dive deeper
616,that is fun! kind of sad that humans as a whole play games for 3 billion hours a week,Surprised
616," This is true! and I'm sure as video games progress and evolve we will lose touch of reality, what is reality anyway? Another cool game out there ""Little Big Planet"" was narrated by Stephen Fry. He also narrated hitchhiker guide to the galaxy and harry potter video games. Little Big Planet though is a fun Family game.",Curious to dive deeper
616," ah thats cool, I do like that game, did you ever play a toy story game? Tom Hanks brother does all the voices actually",Surprised
616," No I have not, some theorists categorize video games as a form of art, but this designation is controversial. I was a hardcore Nintendo Super Mario girl. I still Love that game.",Curious to dive deeper
616,haha that game is amazing and I agree they are an art form! do you watch any judge judy btw,Curious to dive deeper
616," agreed, and Yes I have, I hear she makes about 123,000 an episode! yes, please! She makes almost as much as Lebron.",Curious to dive deeper
616," thats nuts! yup the second highest paid celebrity, I wonder how much Robin Williams made for doing the genie in aladdin",Curious to dive deeper
616," Im not sure, but surely a heck of a lot, he was a famous celebrity by then. He was probably one of the few to be able to enter Pixar's studio secret room.",Curious to dive deeper
616," haha ya I agree, did you watch Sesame street as a kid? I never knew the first celebrity on the show was Carol Burnett",Surprised
616," Interesting! well you know, celebrity status is often associated with wealth and PERKS! How cool!",Happy
616,indeed! did you hear about the planet that rains molten glass on it? Thats one place I dont want to visit haha,Surprised
616," I am so glad to be a part of this Planet! uuf! I cant imagine living there either. I dislike winter to the core but 4500 mph and 2000 degree fahrenheit weather, no Thanks! ",Curious to dive deeper
616," ya I'm ok where I am haha, I would like to travel to venus, I guess it doesn't tilt and thus has no seasons",Surprised
616," I wonder if venus made it to the planets that remain from the original planets discovered before the 50's, its crazy how much has changed. We now have Ceres, Pallas and Juno amongst others as celestial bodies, mind blowing  know.",Happy
616," that is crazy, also its crazy that its the only planet to rotate clockwise, like why is that haha",Surprised
616,and apparently it's only 455 light years away! ha The universe is amazing.,Curious to dive deeper
616," haha well that is the planet that has potential life on it, I think Venus is much closer, but its all good!",Surprised
616," I should try going out more, they say that five planets in the solar system are visible to the naked eye. ",Curious to dive deeper
616," wow that is cool, and I always wondered why Pluto was excluded and I guess it was from the 2006 decision where scientists formally outlined the classifications of planets",Surprised
617,I just had a long day of playing video games. How was your day?,Curious to dive deeper
617," Hello,  sounds rough,  hope you can make it through the convo lol My day has been pretty great,  cant complain.  Did you know there is a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways?",Curious to dive deeper
617,Did not know that! It seems to me that you are interested in space?,Curious to dive deeper
617,I like space.  Not enough to be hugely educated in it though lol I know Jupiter's storms can be heard on an Am radio though!  Never actually listened to it.,Curious to dive deeper
617," Do you believe that life exists outside of Earth? I'm on the fence, but I've heard that astronomers have some evidence of life 455 light-years away.",Surprised
617," Yes,  I think so.  Its just weird that out of all those planets and space and galaxies that we are the only planet with life. ",Curious to dive deeper
617,I agree. Sometimes I just look at the moon at night and think about how small we all are compared to what else is out there!,Happy
617," I know right,  just thinking about space and everything out there is very humbling.  We are so tiny. ",Curious to dive deeper
617,We definitely are. Have you ever seen the movie Wall-E? Some of it takes place on a spaceship!,Happy
617,I have seen it but I dont remember all of it lol.,Curious to dive deeper
617,I just love that movie. I love Pixar. Did you know that they have a secret room that is often visited by celebrities?,Surprised
617," I did,  Ive always wondered what was in there lol I hope free sandwiches lol ",Curious to dive deeper
617,I'm sure there are. Celebrities have a lot of perks. Wish I was one!,Neutral
617," Robin Williams was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films.  That seems fun,  I wouldnt mind being a voice actor,  I do not want to be a celebrity at all,  just rich lol Seems like they have a tough life. ",Curious to dive deeper
617," Yeah, but being rich takes a load of stress off of your shoulders. For example, Judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode!",Surprised
617," Yeah thats why I would just want to be rich,  i dont care about being a celebrity at all. ",Curious to dive deeper
617," Well, I guess normal people have it easy. We can just play video games all day!",Happy
617,Tom Hanks' brother does the Woody voice in the video games and merchandise.,Curious to dive deeper
617,Interesting! I guess kids in South Korea have it rough. It's illegal for them to play video games past midnight.,Sad
617," Wow really,  I had no idea,  I wonder how they regulate that ",Curious to dive deeper
617,Same here! I think I'm going to go play more video games now. It was great chatting with you!,Happy
617,Wonderful chatting with you as well.,Curious to dive deeper
618,Hello.   What do you think of Pluto-planet or not?,Neutral
618,If it were up to me it would be a planet. Seems silly to deem it otherwise.,Curious to dive deeper
618,I agree.  I don't like how the parameters for what is a planet and what isn't is determined by where and what they orbit.,Neutral
618," Yeah but humans are a weird species, they have laws and rules for everything",Curious to dive deeper
618,True.  Look at Jupiter's moon Ganymede.  If it orbited the sun it would be a planet by definition.,Neutral
618," Yeah and there is also a planet that orbits 4 stars, that's crazy.",Curious to dive deeper
618,I wonder how that works. I guess the stars are close together?,Neutral
618," Maybe, but they would have to be far enough apart so they are not affected by each others gravity fields yet be able to influence the planet that is orbiting them.",Curious to dive deeper
618,That's true.  So that would mean a very large galaxy.  What do you think of the planet where shards of glass precipitate sidewys at 4500 mph in 2000 degree fahrenheit weather?,Neutral
618," Man that would be scary, imagine is it started raining glass on earth, we would be screwed.",Curious to dive deeper
618,Yes we would.  For something odd closer to home we've got Venus with it's no seasons.,Neutral
618,Do you play video games? I play probably way more than I should haha.,Curious to dive deeper
618,I do play some. I play more on my phone nowadays though.  It's said that we play three billion hours of video games a week.,Neutral
618," I mainly play on pc and I play a ton of a game called League of Legends, I have over 4k hours, pretty crazy how addicting games can be.",Curious to dive deeper
618,That's for sure.  I have to say though that I don't agree with some people that games are an art form.,Neutral
618," it really depends on the game, for it to be art it really needs to stand out, but really games are not more art than a movie is.",Curious to dive deeper
618,Did you know that video games were initially used by the military?,Neutral
618," Yeah I can see that, they are good training for certain things, like hand eye coordination. Video games also make more money annually than all Hollywood films.",Curious to dive deeper
618," Even still, South Korea has a law that it's illegal for kids under 16 to play video games past midnight.",Neutral
618," Well Korea is huge for pro game players, so it's not a surprise they have more regulations on it. I also think chuck e cheese is horrible for children and I think it promotes gambling at a very early age.",Curious to dive deeper
618," Speaking of early ages, Toy Story video games actually have Tom Hanks brother as Woody and not him.",Neutral
619," Hello there, do you play video games much these days?",Curious to dive deeper
619,Not really... I hear it's illegal in S. Korea for kids 16 and under to play after midnight.  That rule works for me...,Surprised
619," That is very interesting, I wonder if any other countries around the world have similar rules. ",Curious to dive deeper
619,Probably... I didn't know Tom Hanks had a brother that does his voice on video games and merchandise...,Surprised
619," Jimmy Hanks!  I think I have heard about that before, good call!",Curious to dive deeper
619," I guess ya gotta help out your bro.  Video games were once called ""cathode ray tube amusement devices"" by the military... Yawn...",Surprised
619,Yeah I don't think they imagined there would be multimillion dollar stadiums built for them.,Curious to dive deeper
619,What was the military even doing with them?  Did you know that Venus doesn't tilt so it has no seasons?,Curious to dive deeper
619," That is interesting, I think it is the only planet that rotates clock-wise as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
619," For really weird rotation, Uranus actually rotates sideways and seems to ""roll"" around the sun. ",Curious to dive deeper
619," Thats crazy, I wonder what earth would be like if we weren't spinning around, and we were rolling like uranus lol. ",Curious to dive deeper
619," I guess we'd have really burned and cold poles.  Jupiter has a moon. Ganymede, that's more than big enough to be a planet if it were rotating the Sun.",Curious to dive deeper
619,Very interesting.  I guess there is a planet out there that has crazy winds of glass that blow at 4500 mph!,Curious to dive deeper
619," Wow, that would require a bit more than an umbrella... I guess signs of life have been detected on a planetary system 455 light-years away.  Very far, far away...",Curious to dive deeper
619," That doesn't seem too far away in the whole of space, very interesting, I wonder what our technology will reveal in the next 10 years or so. ",Curious to dive deeper
619,It's small condiering the universe and very far for Earthlings.  We can't even fathom going to Proxima Centarti 4+ light-years away.  So are you into celebrities?,Curious to dive deeper
619," Oh yeah for sure far for us as humans, I would really say I am, I don't get all the hype.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
619,Most of them have pissed me off with their force-fed moronic political views.  I do miss Robin Williams.  I didn't realize he was the voice of Aladdin and the 1st to start that trend.,Sad
619," Oh yeah, I miss him dearly, he seemed a different breed of most of those types, and yeah he was awesome in that!",Curious to dive deeper
619,Did ya know Pixar has a secret room that is often visited by celebrities?  Wonder what's in there?,Curious to dive deeper
619," No but I wonder the same, I wonder what kinds of things they would have in there?  ",Curious to dive deeper
619," I guess it's not for us mere mortals... Wow, Judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode for doing what she would be doing off-camera. ",Surprised
619," That is insane!  Oh judge Judy wonder what you do with all your money lol.  Anyways, it's been good talking, I hope you have a good night!",Happy
620,Hey have you ever seen Justin Timberlake in concert before?,Curious to dive deeper
620,No.  I have not.  I am not really much into pop music.  It seems like he has been around forever.,Curious to dive deeper
620," Yeah he's been around for a while, he's actually going to perform at the Capital One Arena very soon. His newest album is called man of the Woods by the way",Happy
620,Wasn't is previous album FutureSex/LoveSounds in 2006?  What is the reason for the long dry spell?,Curious to dive deeper
620,Yeah I don't know. I think he just needed some time to get his bearings. I guess a lot of people think that his songs feel empty in this new release though,Surprised
620," Thinking back, about the only thing I remember about Justin Timberlake is NippleGate in the 2004 Super Bowl.  From what I read, in the interim has broken into acting, gotten married and became a father.  Do people think his songs are ""empty"" because he has changed his style or do they think he has lost his musical bearing?  His major life changes may have changed his musical perspective.",Curious to dive deeper
620,Yes I think is you could alter your taste in music will change. What do you think about albums though? Who made your favorite album,Curious to dive deeper
620," Pink Floyd ""The Wall"" is my favorite.  Did you know ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" is still one of the best selling albums after 40 years!  And yours?",Curious to dive deeper
620," Wow that's great! I also love Pink Floyd and I love Metallica, I know that my friend loves Linkin Park and they have a best selling album right now",Surprised
620," I did not know that.  What I find interesting is the resurgence in vinyl LPs for audiophiles.  Most of my music is digital, except for some local Louisiana bands who never made it big.  I still have their vinyl albums and play them every now and then.  What do you think of NWA's Straight Outta Compton?",Curious to dive deeper
620,I think it's a great album! It's crazy that it went platinum without getting any AirPlay or without them doing a tour,Surprised
620,Do you think that the movie by the same name had anything to do with it going platinum?,Curious to dive deeper
620,Yes I think it went platinum before the movie came out haha. Have you heard about the famous Japanese rappers though? They are twins and also 100 years old,Surprised
620," That's hilarious!  But it shows the international reach of pop music.  I remember South Korean ""Gangnam Style"" was big here, I believe in 2012.  Did  you N. Korea has its own girl pop band?",Curious to dive deeper
620," No I didn't, I wonder if there are any good? Have you heard them play any songs",Curious to dive deeper
620," No I have not heard N. Koreas ""Moranbong Band"".  For them to even exist they must sing praises of the Kim dynasty.  Switching to geeks, did you know scientist have voted Queens ""We are the Champions"" as the catchiest pop song of all time?",Curious to dive deeper
620,No I didn't hear about that. But it makes sense that song is always stuck in my head haha. Do you ever play the guitar by the way?,Curious to dive deeper
620," No.  I spent more time out hunting, fishing, roping, and riding.  But I do like to go hear the jazz / blues guitarists in New Orleans from time to time.  In my youth, Van Halen was one of my favs.  Did you know Eddie Van Halen recorded a guitar solo in which he set studio speakers on fire?  The song was ""Beat It"".  He sure beat up those speakers!!!!",Surprised
620,I heard about that! He actually set the speakers on fire because his solo was so awesome LOL that's hilarious,Happy
620,What I never figured out is the acts that smash guitars.  I guess because I am a bit of a tightwad and would never intentionally smash something that cost hundreds or thousands of dollars.  Matthew Bellamy with use holds the Guinness World Record for that!,Surprised
620," Yeah I think that's a really dumb record, but I guess it's in the Guinness Book of World Records so oh well, what do you think about Queen's guitarist Brian made by the way? He has a PHD in astrophysics so he must be really smart",Surprised
621," Do you like Justin Timberlake?  He has a tour called ""Man of the Woods""?",Curious to dive deeper
621," I have never been that huge of a fan, but I have heard his concerts are amazing.  I remember watching the HBO special of his Madison Square Garden show.  Are you a fan?",Curious to dive deeper
621," No, I'm not.  I don't dislike him however... I guess people aren't quite buying his re-branding.  One said, ""all the flannel in the world couldn't warm critical reception to the tour.""",Neutral
621," Haha, that is a great line.  I think he became a lot more personable after marrying Jessica Biel.  He has definitely come a long way from Nipplegate.",Neutral
621,Ha.  He seems to be more effect.  Many think he should stick to his hits and not try to change too much.,Curious to dive deeper
621," I have heard some call his new tour empty, but that ""many people enjoy empty fun.""  Sounds poignant, but also a shot at society!",Surprised
621,I think the detractors mainly don't like the theme and think he should do shows as he has always done.,Neutral
621," Yes, people love the old stuff in general.  One of the best-selling albums of 2014 was Dark Side of the Moon.  Over 40 years after being initially released!",Surprised
621," Yes, it's a classic.  Pink Floyd is different.  They turned a houseboat into a floating recording studio on the river Thames.",Surprised
621," Haha, yup they are awesome.  I was a being fan of Linkin Park.  Very sad to hear what happened to them after having one of the best selling album's of the 21st century.",Sad
621," What happened to them?  I know ""Hybrid Theory"" was the album of which you speak. ",Curious to dive deeper
621,*Big fan I meant.  The lead singer passed away recently.,Sad
621," Oh, sorry to hear that.  On a lighter note, two identical twins in Japan released a rap album when they turned 100 in 1992.",Sad
621,That is remarkable!  Sounds about as wild as the president of Indonesia releasing 3 pop albums while in office!,Surprised
621," Yes, as wild as scientist voting the song ""We are the Champions"" as the catchiest song of all time.  I miss Freddy...",Sad
621," Me too :(  Those were the good old days.  When Eddie Van Halen literally set fire to the speakers when recording ""Beat It.""",Surprised
621," His amp must have gone to ""11"" like in the movie Spinal Tap.  Funny, Ricky Gervals was a pop singer in the 1980's. ",Curious to dive deeper
621,I cannot picture that!  They all have interesting quirks.  LIke Brian May using coins instead of guitar picks.,Curious to dive deeper
621," Or Matthew Bellamy from Muse destroying so many guitars.  Sad, he should donate them to a good cause.  That's been done, move on...",Disgusted
621,I agree.  He actually owns the Guinness world record for most guitars smashed!  Not ideal!,Disgusted
621," I agree.  Do something unique at least.  I think the Who did that, Hendrix set one on fire... Old news.  ",Disgusted
621," Yup, I am with you!  It was a pleasure chatting today!",Happy
622,Are you a big fan of dancing?,Curious to dive deeper
622,Huge fan! I like the cha-cha. You?,Happy
622," Yeah I am, I used to go out dancing with my ex quite a bit.  Did you know Tupac danced ballet in hight school?",Curious to dive deeper
622,I did not that is very interesting! I did know Bruce Lee was a great dancer.,Happy
622," Yes, I have heard that before about Bruce Lee, that guy was super talented. ",Neutral
622,My baby also is a great dancer and seems to follow the beat!,Happy
622,Wow! That must be really fun to watch. I was always a fan of Michael Jackson's dancing.,Happy
622,He was a legend in dancing! I am pretty fascinated by the moon how about you?,Curious to dive deeper
622," Yes I am.  I didn't know moon dust causes moon hay fever, did you?",Curious to dive deeper
622,I did not I thought the space suit was solely for oxygen but I guess it is also to protect them. The moon is not flat you know the tallest point is almost 2000 meters higher than Mt Everest.,Curious to dive deeper
622," Wow! I did not know that, very interesting.  I guess some people believed one of Mar's moons was artificial!",Surprised
622,There is all kinds of funny ideas such as the moon landing being fake. They have found methane based life on titan!,Curious to dive deeper
622," Yeah I've definitely heard those before, and wow! That is exciting to hear. ",Surprised
622,I am also big into playing the piano do you play?,Curious to dive deeper
622," No, I do not, but always wanted to learn.  I think it is an awesome instrument.  How long have you played?",Curious to dive deeper
622," I have played 20 years, The hindenburg blimp had a piano built for the lounge!",Surprised
622," That is very impressive, I'm sure you are quite talented.  And wow, whenever I think of blimps I think of the Indiana Jones movie.  ",Surprised
622,There was a group of climbers that climbed Britain's tallest mountain and found a piano on top!,Surprised
622,That is the craziest fact I have heard so far.  I wonder why someone would do that.,Surprised
622,I don't know but it is pretty cool! Pianos are very old instruments created in 1700!!,Surprised
622," That is old, I wonder how much some of those pianos if they are still around are worth today?",Curious to dive deeper
622,I would imagine quite a lot! I enjoyed chatting with you I must run now though.,Curious to dive deeper
622," Thank you, I did as well.  Thanks for the timely responses. ",Happy
622,Your welcome good bye.,Happy
623," Hello, are you a Tupac fan? I am and wasn't aware he was a ballet dancer in High school",Curious to dive deeper
623," I'm not the biggest fan of rap, admittedly, but I do like some of his work.  Neat that he was a ballet dancer.  Speaking of ballet dancers, I'm told they go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a WEEK.  Talk about being on your toes!",Surprised
623,They sure do! Michael Jackson had specially made shoes for some of his own dance moves.,Surprised
623," Wonder if that how he was able to do that ""extreme lean"" move he does.  (I'm told he owns a patent on the device, but dunno if the device is shoes or something else...)  Did you know Bruce Lee was also a great dancer?",Surprised
623,He won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha in 1958. my kids do the cha cha slide in Call of Duty.,Surprised
623," Hehe. That's funny.  Speaking of kids, they say even babies spontaneously dance when they hear music.  I saw a youtube video once of a baby jamming out to Gangnum Style by Psy.  LOL",Happy
623," That is cute when they do that. I didn't know that moon dust is so sharp, it can cut through kevlar.",Surprised
623," Not just that, but they say it can give you ""Moon Hay Fever"".  Had no idea there was moon hay fever... that just sounds both scary and nutty... ",Surprised
623," Yeah, it does. I can't believe NASA thought about placing a UN flag on the moon, instead of the American flag.",Curious to dive deeper
623," Ahhh... forget that!  As far as I know, the UN didn't help the US get to the moon.  Grrr... don't get started on the subject of the UN, trying to watch my blood pressure!  :)  Speaking of moons, did you know Phobos (Mars' moon) is one third hollow?  ",Disgusted
623,I've always wondered how they know things like this. Especially when you think that they once thought it was hollow.,Curious to dive deeper
623," That I can't tell ya.. it's just amazing all the stuff they've been able to discover just by telescopes and pictures.  Heck, they believe there's evidence of methane based life on Satan's moon, Titan.  That'd be pretty amazing if they can confirm it!",Surprised
623," If they were smart, they would stay hidden. Oddly, an aluminum grand piano was built for the Hindenburg. I wonder how it sounded?",Curious to dive deeper
623," That's a good question, dunno if making it out of aluminum would make it sound different or not.  Like with violins.  There's a noticeable difference in sound with them depending on the type of wood used...",Surprised
623," I don't know much about them, as neither of my kids play piano. It's interesting that Freddie Mercury and Paul McCartney used the same piano to record songs on",Curious to dive deeper
623," That'd probably make it one of the most valuable piano's ever (if it was up for sale, that is.)  Speaking of piano, did you know there's a song designed for stress testing auto-pianos?  It's called Circus Galop.  You can hear it on Youtube if you're interested...",Curious to dive deeper
623,I did not. I wonder how a piano got to the top of Britains highest mountain?,Curious to dive deeper
623," My guess?  Pranksters!  LOL.  I mean, seriously, who looks at a huge mountain, and says, ""Hey, lets get a piano up there!""  ",Surprised
623," That sounds very difficult. I've hiked the AT, and have left water behind, because it added too much weight. The BBC once decided there was nothing worth reporting, so they broadcast piano music instead.",Surprised
623,The AT?  What's that?  Must have been a REAL slow news day.  Way the news is today I think sometimes I'd rather listen to piano music instead!,Curious to dive deeper
623," I know I would. Thank you for chatting with me today, have a wonderful day.",Neutral
623," Hey, you too!  Take care!",Happy
623,Thank you,Neutral
623,Maybe we'll chat again sometime!,Happy
623," Maybe, lol",Neutral
623," So, be safe!  The weather's been a little crazy around parts of the country.",Curious to dive deeper
624,Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer?,Curious to dive deeper
624," No but I figure since he was so good in martial arts moves, dancing would come easy.  What is more surprising is Mr. Rogers learned to break dance on an episode.  ",Curious to dive deeper
624,Lee won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship in 1958.,Neutral
624,Well another actress who won dancing was Emilia Clarke.  She did the funky chicken dance and robot dance during her audition to Game of Thrones.,Surprised
624,It doesn't seem that that would help her get the part.  Tupac danced ballet in high school.,Neutral
624," Really!  I always thought he was softy in the inside.  Speaking of ballet, there are slippers that made drawings from the dancer's movements.  ",Curious to dive deeper
624," That would look like modern art to me.  Tupac obtained the role of Mouse King in a production of Nutcracker, so he was serious about it.",Neutral
624,Another dance who took his job seriously was tap dancer Bill Bailey he was the first to do the moon walk ever recorded.  This whole time I thought Michael Jackson was the first.,Surprised
624," I did not know that.  Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music, so I must have lost my sense of rhythm between 1 and 5 years old.",Neutral
624," Well Richard Nixon had a great sense of rhythm, he wrote a piano concerto and performed it live on the Tonight Show.  ",Happy
624,That is incredible!  Ballet dancers can wear out 4 pairs of dancing shoes per week.  Looks like that could find a more durable material.,Neutral
624,Dance is such a beautiful art even parrots are getting into the action.  Parrots are able to dance perfectly in time with music.,Happy
624,My daughter used to have an African Grey.  I have seen the bird do it.  My wife plays the piano which is a stringed instrument but because of the hammers can be a percussion instrument setting the beat for the parrot.,Neutral
624,Do you think parrots can dance to the sound of a piano?  It crazy to think that steam piano's used to exist and I hear they are very loud.,Happy
624,They can move with the beat. There is a gorgeous pianist named Lola Anastanove or something like that that I saw on Youtube.  Freddie Mercury used the same piano to record Bohemian Rhapsody as Paul McCartney used for Hey Jude.,Neutral
624,Interesting fact!  I saw a Youtube video about a mute man who was found wandering the streets in England and the only way he could communicate was via piano.,Curious to dive deeper
624,In 2006 a group of climbers reached the top of Britain's highest mountain and found a piano.,Neutral
624,How in the world could a piano have been placed there?  Fun piano fact.  Mozart and Haydn two of the biggest composers of the classical era each owned a piano made from the same tree.,Happy
624," That is a fun fact.  I would guess a helicopter on the piano placement.  They needed a light grand piano on the Hindenburg, so they made one of aluminum and it weighed 356 pounds.",Neutral
624,All these fun piano facts and to think Italy was the county that invented the piano.,Happy
624," We have a 7 ft 6 inch grand in our house.  It is a great instrument.  Don't forget to look up Lola, the greatest female pianist of the day.. Nice talking with you.",Neutral
625,Dance is a performance of art selected of human movement. It is the birth place so many exercise movement without the equipment.,Happy
625," Awesome, I agree. I love to dance. It's aesthetic and loved by all cultures across the world.",Curious to dive deeper
625,The dance movement differ from culture to culture but all movement are unique it is very interesting to watch it. style is also important.,Happy
625," Yes, I heard that Bruce Lee was actually a great dancer and the Cha Cha championship in 1958. Never would have guessed that!",Curious to dive deeper
625," Yes, Babies dance when they hear music its very wonderful. The body more flexible while dancing and it can reduce stress.",Curious to dive deeper
625," Yes, that must be a pleasure reflex that music promotes in us even as babies. Did you hear that professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shoes in a week?",Curious to dive deeper
625," Its very interesting! Dance can be described by its choreography, to repeat the movement.",Happy
625," Yes, did you know that Tupac danced ballet in his high school and ended up playing the Mouse King in the Nutcracker in his high school production? That's unbelievable. I never would have guessed that one.",Curious to dive deeper
625,The moon is the satellite of the earth which is natural satellite. It is the fifth largest natural satellite in the solar system.,Curious to dive deeper
625," Did you know that moon dust is dangerous? It is harmful to humans and causes a disease call ""moon hay fever"" ? Wow on that one too!",Curious to dive deeper
625,Its very dangerous. Jupiter planet have many number of satellite. The saturn planet have rings.,Happy
625,Wow. Did you know that the moon's highest point is even higher than Mt. Everest  by 1938 meters? Now that's high!,Curious to dive deeper
625,The shape of the moon keep changing from every 15 days. New moon to full moon and then full moon to new moon. We are facing only one side of the moon.,Happy
625," Good to know. Yes, we are on the ""Light Side of the Moon"" which orbits our planet.  Apparently, NASA considered placing a UN instead of an American flag on the moon for Apollo 11.",Curious to dive deeper
625," In moon, water is available in moisture form do you know ?",Curious to dive deeper
625,I'm not sure about that one but I'd like to turn the conversation to the piano.  Did you know that it was only invented around the year 1700?,Curious to dive deeper
625," Amazing. It is played using a keyboard, which is a row of keys the performer press the key. It is very interesting to hear the music of it.",Happy
625," I think so too. I have a few keyboards that I want to learn to play. I heard that Freddie Mercury used the same piano to record ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" that Paul McCartney used to record his song ""Hey Jude"". By the way, Bohemian Rhapsody is out in theaters this week or next, I think.",Curious to dive deeper
625,You know how to play piano. Which is your favourite brand ?,Curious to dive deeper
625," I have a Yamaha Portatone (an old one) and a Casio. Did you know that back in 1930, the BBC thought that there no news worth reporting so they just played piano music instead?  That is cool!",Curious to dive deeper
625,In 2006 group of climbers reached the top of Britain highest mountain and found a piano.,Curious to dive deeper
625,Piano's must soothe the savage soul if someone dragged one to the top of Britain's highest mountain. What a blast that must have been to find that!,Curious to dive deeper
625," Solely for stress testing auto-pianos, and is not remotely playable by humans.",Curious to dive deeper
625," Yes, I heard that's called the Circus Gallop!",Curious to dive deeper
625,Its very interesting.,Neutral
625," Yes, I agree. I also found out that an aluminum piano was built for the Hindenburg airship and weighed 356 pounds. Cool.",Curious to dive deeper
625,The scientist still have research about the moon and best of the different things.,Happy
625," Yes, we still don't know everything we should but we just keep on keeping on.  Thanks for the great chat!",Neutral
625,Ok. Have a great day.,Curious to dive deeper
625,Sure thing,Surprised
626,Do you like Linkin Park? To me they're one of those bands at the turn of the century who were like a holdover from 90s grunge.,Curious to dive deeper
626,I like their first album hybrid theory which happens to be the best selling album of the 21st century,Neutral
626," Yeah, I loved it too. Also all the old album rock of the Progressive Rock era, when people really started listening to music as albums instead of singles. Did you ever do that trick with ""Dark Side of the Moon"" where you play it in sync to The Wizard of Oz?",Happy
626," No I haven't, which trick was that?",Curious to dive deeper
626," If you start the album and the movie playing at exactly the same time, the coincidences between the songs and the movie scenes are pretty weird.",Happy
626," That is weird, not as weird as the President of Indonesia releasing 3 pop albums though",Neutral
626," Yeah, I wonder if they were any good.",Neutral
626,Well the President of Indonesia did release 3,Neutral
626," I should do a YouTube search, now that my curiosity is aroused.",Curious to dive deeper
626," You should youtube Ricky Gervais too, he was a pop singer in the 80s",Surprised
626," He's a comedian now, right?",Curious to dive deeper
626," Yea, he created the original UK version of the office after his pop singer days",Neutral
626," Interesting. Do you play any musical instruments? I've idly thought about learning the guitar for a long time, but never took any serious steps toward it.",Curious to dive deeper
626,I tried to play guitar a few times but I suck at strumming the strings and using both hands,Neutral
626," Yeah, I""m pretty bad at coordination and multitasking so I should probably give up the idea too.",Sad
626,I'd like to be a rockstar and light studio speakers on fire like eddie van halen did for beat it,Neutral
626," I used to imagine myself doing the Eric Draven guitar solo scene in The Crow, LOL.",Happy
626,Having a grand housboat on the River Thames like Pink Floyd's gutarist sounds awesome,Neutral
626,I wonder if that was Gilmour. I actually dreamed about listening to him last night. But to be honest I thought Pink Floyd wasn't as good as a Gilmour-led group after Waters left.,Neutral
626,Well maybe but they might still be preferred over the two identical twins from Japan who released a rap album when they turned 100,Neutral
626," Yeah, they sound creative. Nice chatting with you.",Neutral
627,You a Justin Timberlake fan? Sounds like his current tour is pretty cool.,Curious to dive deeper
627,For a pop artist I don't mind JT. His Man in the Woods Tour? Which is album is that concert for?,Curious to dive deeper
627,I'm not actually sure. I will have to look that up. But he played a lot of past songs too.,Curious to dive deeper
627,Oh! I think the album is actually called Man in the Woods. I don't think it was as good as his earlier stuff. I only really remember Say Something from this new album.,Curious to dive deeper
627,Yeah. Well I think it's safe to say he has come a long way since Mickey Mouse Club!,Happy
627,Have you seen any of the movies he's been in?,Curious to dive deeper
627,Yeah I saw the one about facebook which I thought was good. He is a good actor but I think he should stick to pop music. Ricky Gervais was a pop singer oddly enough.,Surprised
627,I can't remember the name of the movie I saw him but Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal were in it too. It was pretty good. I can't imagine Ricky Gervais singing at all! He's hilarious though.,Neutral
627,Oh yeah I remember that movie too. Like a rom-com. Yes he is. I want to look up his video lol. Wonder if he played the guitar?,Curious to dive deeper
627,Haha I don't think so. His voices doesn't sound like it would translate to a singing voice at all. Although doesn't his character in The Office sing?,Curious to dive deeper
627," Haha occasionally yes but not well. I just watched the movie about queen. The guitarist, Brian May, has a phd in astrophysics.",Surprised
627," I haven't seen that movie, but that band was incredibly talented. I heard the actor who played Freddie Mercury in it didn't sing the songs himself.",Neutral
627,No don't think he did. He won an oscar for it though. well deserved. Matthew Bellamy from the band muse holds the guiness world record for most guitars smashed on tour!,Curious to dive deeper
627,That's cool! Muse is pretty underrated band. Super Massive Blackhole was a great album.,Happy
627,Yeah I agree. Van Halen was also one of my favorites. He actually set the speakers on fire when he recorded beat it.,Surprised
627,Do you like rock music better than pop music?,Curious to dive deeper
627," Yeah for sure. But I do like ""We are the champions"" which has been coined the catchiest pop music of all time.",Neutral
627,It's kind of sad that rock music has been forgotten. At the Grammy's you barely know rock music is still around based on how they present it.,Neutral
627,True. It's all pop and rap. Even the president of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums.,Curious to dive deeper
627," It's interesting that ""We are the Champions"" is considered a pop song. That doesn't seem right.",Surprised
627,Yes I thought the same thing. It should be rock. I don;t know what those scientists were thinking! It was great talking with you today!,Curious to dive deeper
627," Same, have a great weekend.",Neutral
628,Hi. Did you know that moon dust can cut through kevlar like material?,Neutral
628," No, that's fascinating. Did you know the highest point on the moon is 1938 meters taller than Mt. Everest?",Curious to dive deeper
628,I didn't know that.  It really makes you think about how it must be walking around on the moon doesn't it?,Neutral
628," Yea, I wouldn't want to catch hay fever walking around with all that moon dust",Neutral
628,i've heard that hay fever from moon dust is harmful to people.,Neutral
628,I heard apollo 11 considered placing a UN flag on the moon instead of the US flag,Neutral
628," Hmm, that could have been a good thing.  It would have included the whole planet.  What do you think?",Neutral
628," I prefer the US flag, I mean everyone on Apollo 11 was from the US ",Neutral
628,True. It was definitely an American accomplishment.  I wonder what made them decide not to use the UN flag.,Neutral
628,I don't know. It's pretty interesting one of Saturn's moons may have methane based life,Neutral
628,That is interesting!  Is it Titan?  I think that's Saturn's most well known moon.,Neutral
628," Mars' mon Phobos is one third hollow, that's crazy",Surprised
628,That is crazy.  It's crazy that scientists can know that and it's crazy that a large partially hollow object is orbitting around in space.,Neutral
628," Yea that is pretty crazy, so is Bruce Lee winning the cha-cha championship in 1958",Surprised
628,Bruce Lee won a dance contest?,Neutral
628," Yep, and Tupac did ballet in high school too",Neutral
628," I can see Bruce lee dancing, but Tupac doing ballet?  That's amazing.",Neutral
628," Yep, Tupac played the Mouse King in his high school production of The Nutcracker ",Neutral
628,That is pretty cool.  Did you know that Michael Jackson has a patent on a device he used for some of his dance moves?,Neutral
628," Yea, they have videos on youtube showing how it works. Did you know the same piano was used to record Bohemian Rhapsody and Hey Jude?",Curious to dive deeper
628,i honestly did not know that.  I wonder if Freddie Mercury and Paul McCartney were friends.,Neutral
629,Bruce Lee was so talented. He even won the hong kong cha-cha championship back in 1958! Man of many talents.,Neutral
629,Bruce Lee was great! I loved his movies.  Michael Jackson was also talented.  He has patent on a device that he used in dancing.,Neutral
629,That's so amazing! Even Tupac danced ballet in high school. Would have never known that.,Surprised
629,True.  Do you like cars?  What do you think of Tesla?,Neutral
629," Yes. Is it just me or is Tesla becoming a very popular car all of a sudden. Toyota owns 10% of Tesla, didn't know that ",Curious to dive deeper
629,I didn't know that either.  Tesla is growing in popularity. I think it is because of Elon Musk.,Neutral
629,Elon took a 78$ million paycut in 2014 and returned it all but $1! How crazy,Neutral
629,He is impressive. Did you know he founded Paypal?,Curious to dive deeper
629,He did? I did not know that! He was smart man.,Curious to dive deeper
629,He also founded spacex.  I wonder if he'll have space travel for everyone eventually.,Neutral
629,Wow! Who knew. Tesla model s runs linux. Fun fact!,Neutral
629,I certainly didn't.  I like that they are heavily into solar energy.,Surprised
629,They specialize in a lot that I didn't know about. Even powerpack batteries.,Neutral
629,I didn't know about solar roof tiles. I thought solar was just for the cars.,Surprised
629,You can use them for solar energy I think. Whats really interesting is that Fox news is watched more than cnn and msnbc combined. I would think CNN would be popular.,Neutral
629,It is gaining in trust and popularity.  I had no idea that Richard Nixon had a hand in creating it.,Surprised
629,That's neat. They broadcast in 86 countries!,Neutral
629,I didn't know that either. Did you know they threatened to sue the Simpsons?,Curious to dive deeper
629,I didn't! Apparently they didn't like being parodied by them for anti-democractic party agenda.,Neutral
629," Seems odd to sue them though. I mean, the Simpsons is a show on Fox which owns Fox News.  It seems like Fox could have just stopped them.",Curious to dive deeper
629,That's right. Especially since they have talked about creating a channel that would only air the Simpsons. It's like they want to keep them yet they dont want to associate with them.,Neutral
629,Odd.  Fox also has affiliations with the gaming website ign.,Neutral
629,Interesting!,Surprised
630," hi, do you like dance?",Curious to dive deeper
630," I do, however I am not very good at it, which is what makes it half of the fun",Curious to dive deeper
630,I guess. Did you know tupac was a dancer?,Curious to dive deeper
630,I didn't know that.  I do know that parrots do have the ability to dance in time to music.,Surprised
630,That is cool. Yeah Tupac practiced ballet,Curious to dive deeper
630," Wow, he was really a person of diverse talents.  I heard there was this one episode of Mr. Rogers where he learned to breakdance.  Id like to see that one.  It seems as out of place as Tupac and ballet",Surprised
630,I know and it is a diffucult type of dance too. they go through 4 pairs of shoes A WEEK,Curious to dive deeper
630," I dont even go though that in a period of months, in terms of sneakers that is. That must get expensive",Surprised
630,Yeah I bet and they do not make that much money,Curious to dive deeper
630," Yeah, definitely not enough for a Tesla, have you seen those cars?  They are pretty neat.  ",Curious to dive deeper
630," Yes they are, I hope to be able to afford one one day",Curious to dive deeper
630," Supposedly Toyota owns 10% of tesla, that might be as close as I ever get.  ",Surprised
630,Oh wow did not know that. ANd tesla model s runs linux,Curious to dive deeper
630," That is pretty cool.  I like when groups think outside the box, it is that kind of innovation that we need.  Teslas are supposedly so safe they broke the safety testing equipment",Surprised
630,that is cool and also model s is tested indoors becuase it does not produce emissions,Curious to dive deeper
630," I didnt know that it was because it got tested indoors, but given how they run that does make sense.",Curious to dive deeper
630,yeah. did you know elon also founded paypal?,Curious to dive deeper
630," No.  Ive read his biography, but didn't remember that one.  He is a fascinating person.  If people complained about their wages, he would often try to do their job, and if he deemed that he could do it, or it could otherwise be absorbed, he would fire them.",Neutral
630," Wow, he can be eccentric sometimes. I guess that is why he has managed to be where he is",Curious to dive deeper
630,They even release their patents to encourage competition.,Curious to dive deeper
630,WOw. Nice chatting with you,Happy
631," Hello, How are you tonight? Have you seen the Tesla car?",Curious to dive deeper
631," Yes I've actually driven in a Tesla before, what about you? I like that they have a lot of vehicles coming out like the model S and model X these days",Happy
631," Yeah, I heard they were coming out with new cars. Exciting!! What do you think of Elon Musk? I have watched him a few times in interviews.",Curious to dive deeper
631," Yeah he's very entertaining and interviews I think. It is crazy to me though that the Tesla Model S is so safe that somehow it broke the safety testing equipment, I don't know how that's possible LOL",Surprised
631," Really, I agree, How does that happen? Saw where he took a  $78 million pay cut in 2014.",Surprised
631," Yeah that is impressive. It's also impressive that Tesla releases their patents in order to encourage competition, I definitely would not do that if I owned the company haha",Surprised
631," Most people wouldn't, wonder why? To help the environment? Who knows he probably got something else better lined up!",Surprised
631," Yeah I agree. It's crazy though that they named themselves after Nikola Tesla, but they're not the only company that was named after him! There is another car company called just Nicola apparently",Surprised
631," Interesting, I owned an electric car for 3 years, it was an easy car to drive. My husband named it the phantom! He could never here when I got home. lol",Happy
631," Haha well that is one benefit of the electric-car then! On a different note though, what do you think about Fox News? Apparently they broadcasting over 86 countries around the world",Curious to dive deeper
631,About the only one I watch these days! I didn't know Richard Nixon was one of the creators!,Surprised
631," Yeah I didn't know that either! I also didn't know that they were going to sue The Simpsons because they kept parodying them, I thought that fox owns The Simpsons?",Surprised
631,I did too! Didn't know they were going to create a cable channel  just for The Simpsons! Do you watch that show?,Surprised
631," I liked to watch The Simpsons yes, back to fox news though it's interesting that their median viewer age is 68, that seems old",Surprised
631," Yes, That's strange, find that hard to believe. I do believe Fox news is watched more than CNN and MSNBC combined.",Neutral
631," Yes I think you're right. It's also interesting that Fox News has only 55% of its time dedicated to opinion pieces while on MSNBC at 85% of the time, they definitely have a better percentage on Fox News in my opinion",Surprised
631," I think so.Do you like Dance? I love to watch babies dance to music, adorable!!",Happy
631,Yes I agree with you! I also think it's funny that the girl from Game of Thrones did the robot dance and also the Funky Chicken during her audition LOL I wish I could see that tape,Surprised
631," Ha, ha, ha,I can imagine that! I'm not surprised MJ used a device for the lean dance move? Wasn't that in the song  Smooth Criminal?",Neutral
631,Yes I think so. I'm also shocked that he has a patent on that device. It's crazy though that the moonwalk was first performed in1955 so it's actually an old dance move,Surprised
631," Really, didn't know that? 1955, they had all kind of different moves then. Good chat!!",Neutral
631," Thank you you too! And watch out next time you see a ballet dancer, apparently some ballet slippers can make drawings out of the performers movements on the floor",Happy
632," hi, do you enjoy reading?",Curious to dive deeper
632," Yes, I like to read before I go to sleep. ",Curious to dive deeper
632," nice, me too. did you ever read the starship trooper?",Curious to dive deeper
632,I never read the star ship Trooper but I do like science fiction novels. It is not my first choice for a genera but I enjoy all fantasy.,Curious to dive deeper
632," yeah , me either but is it in the reading list of three out of five us military branches",Curious to dive deeper
632,I don't think I would like a military recommended novel which would focus on battle strategies. I prefer Harry Potter.,Curious to dive deeper
632," nice, that is a good one. did you know the actor who play malfoy was caught trying to steal the wand?",Curious to dive deeper
632,I would hope they would let him have the wand anyway. I would imagine those actors deserve the memorabilia.,Neutral
632," i think so too. when daniel won the part of harry potter, do you know what his reward was?",Curious to dive deeper
632,I think his parents let him watch Faulty Towers. I am only vaguely familiar with the TV show but I would imagine it is still a fun classic show in the UK.,Neutral
632,yeah and he must have been so happy to be able to do that,Curious to dive deeper
632," Yes, I am sure he is very grateful for being able to be apart of the movies. The Lord of the Rings films came out during that time and I always though he would also make a great Frodo.",Neutral
632,ohh yeah that is true. do you know where hogwarts is located?,Curious to dive deeper
632," Yes, Hogwarts is in Scotland.",Neutral
632," yeah, many people think it is in England actually",Curious to dive deeper
632," I is a very English novel so I can imagine why people would think it was located there, not as English as Tolkien and CS Lewis novels. ",Neutral
632,true. the character of troll was actually named harry potter back in the day,Curious to dive deeper
632,I think you are confusing the Lord of the Rings with the unauthorized harry potter sequel.,Neutral
632,maybe. do you read wikipedia much?,Curious to dive deeper
632," Yes, I like to check on the background of artists but I worry it is not always accurate so I just use it for more common information.",Neutral
632," that is very true, it is relevant. nice chat",Happy
633,hi how are you? do you like reading?,Neutral
633,I do like reading. I like the cognitive process of decoding the symbols to derive the meaning.,Curious to dive deeper
633,I like reading because it is a good way to learn and to focus the mind.,Neutral
633,Do you know how to read in Braille?,Curious to dive deeper
633,I never learned. i wonder if it is hard. i see it all over the place on signs and in elevators.,Neutral
633,I'd like to learn as well. It can't be too difficult.,Curious to dive deeper
633,I know that it was invented by a french guy named braille.,Neutral
633," That's interesting. Did you know that in the 18th Century there was a ""moral panic"" because of the spread of the reading of novels?",Curious to dive deeper
633,I know that poetry was the big thing back then. it was considered pure and good for morality. novels had all kinds of dirty themes.,Neutral
633,I guess they didn't want people to gain to much knowledge and perspective.,Surprised
633," Yeah, keeping books away from people usually doesnt work. they eventually get their hands on them.",Neutral
633,Did you know that Ender's Game was suggested reading material for the Marines?,Surprised
633,Enders Game has a lot of strategy and tactics in it. it is probably good for the troops.,Neutral
633," Yeah it does, it's also suggested reading for many other military organizations.",Curious to dive deeper
633,I guess they like military-themed novels for the troops. it will give them a better mindset.,Neutral
633," It probably would, Starship Troopers is another one that's on the list for 3 of the 5 US Military Branches. ",Surprised
633," Heinlein was in the navy, so his books have a lot of war and military. i liked that book. the movie, too.",Neutral
633," I've actually never seen the movie nor read the book, and I was in the military. haha",Surprised
633," LOL. The book is pretty good, but i think boys prefer it. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
633,Great chat! I hope you have a good day!,Happy
633,You too! Have a good day!,Neutral
633,You too!,Neutral
634,Do you like sharks?,Neutral
634," I think they're one of the most interesting animals on the planet plus I enjoy watching Shark Week, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
634," I rarely watch it. But it seems like a cool show, what channel is it on? ",Curious to dive deeper
634,It's on Discovery Channel. It's a yearly event they have with all different sorts of shows that they air.,Happy
634,I don't think I have that channel. Did you know sharks rescue sailors?,Curious to dive deeper
634," I never knew that, I only thought it was dolphins that did that. That is an interesting behavior for a predator.",Surprised
634,It sort of sounds not real to me.,Curious to dive deeper
634,Yeah I kind of have a hard time believing it as well. I like watching some of the crazy movies they have made about sharks like The Meg or Sharknado as well.,Surprised
634,Did you know sharks can be trained like dogs to bark?,Curious to dive deeper
634,I did not know that. That's another shark fact that I have some skepticism about!,Surprised
634," Yeah, I have a lot of them to be honest. Apparently they also evolved earlier than dinosaurs. ",Curious to dive deeper
634," That one I can believe, they have been around is some form for a long time. The Megaladon was a huge ancient shark. They think the Great White caused it's extinction because they were smaller and able to get to prey better.",Surprised
634," What about dogs, are you a fan of dogs? ",Curious to dive deeper
634," I am a big dog person, I have one of my own. I'm allergic to cats so they were never really an option for me.",Happy
634,I'm allergic to cat hair too!,Curious to dive deeper
634,Do you have any pets of your own?,Curious to dive deeper
634," Nah, that is too much of a hassle. Did you know that google prefers dogs to cats? ",Curious to dive deeper
634,I think dogs are the more social animal so it makes sense for a company to have a dog policy over a cat policy. I know of a few people who have therapy dogs that go to hospitals or even to libraries so that children with reading problems can read out loud to them without feeling embarrassed.,Happy
634,This is true. By the way did you know that there are 12 different blood types that a dog can have?,Curious to dive deeper
634,I did not know that. I do know that the dogs and cats than vets keep as office animals are often used for emergency blood donation.,Surprised
634," That's pretty cool. I was unaware of that. Well, nice chatting!",Curious to dive deeper
634," It was nice chatting with you as well, have a great day!",Happy
635,Good morning. How are you this morning?,Neutral
635,Good morning! I am good. Just checking out all the place to eat in Vegas.,Curious to dive deeper
635,I bet there are some nice places out there.,Neutral
635," Yes, some offer up immense 10 egg omelets and pancakes as big as hubcaps, most places on the strip.",Happy
635,Thats awesome. So do you like fish at all?,Neutral
635,I do. They are so unique. It's cool that saltwater fish drink through their moths.,Surprised
635,It is cool. The black swallower fish can eat prey ten times its own weight and twice its own length.,Neutral
635,That is incredible! The only fish without a neck is a seahorse.,Surprised
635,I think the seahorse is the only fish with a neck. Lol. I heard about a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.,Neutral
635,Kind of males me wish to be a jellyfish! Zebra fish carry counterparts to human disease in 84% of their genes.,Curious to dive deeper
635,I bet we could use them to study diseases related to humans then.,Neutral
635,I bet you're right. Freshwater fish drink through their skin via osmosis.,Surprised
635,That is really interesting. So what do you think about judge judy being the second highest paid celebrity behind lebron james?,Happy
635,I have heard that she makes over $100k per episode. It seems over-the-top to me.,Disgusted
635,Hey if she can make that much I dont blame her for taking it. Lol. I guess pixar has a special room that is secret for celebrities.,Neutral
635,That would be fun to see. Do you remember the show Sesame Street? The first celebrity to ever appear on SS was Carol Burnett.,Happy
635,I remember watching sesame street. I dont remember her being on it though. I guess I wsa pretty little though.,Neutral
635," It's hard to believe she was the fist celeb. appearance. Speaking of firsts, The first celeb. to voice an animated film was Robin Williams.",Happy
635,Yeah I think his role as the genie in alladin kind of started that trend. He was awesome in that role.,Happy
635,I agree. He was very talented. It was nice chatting with you today. Have a good day.,Happy
635,You have a great day as well. Nice chat. Bye.,Neutral
636," Hello, how are you doing today?",Happy
636,I am great! how are you?,Neutral
636," I am good, have you ever been to Las Vegas?",Happy
636,I have been to vegas. interesting place.,Neutral
636," It is, it has some of the craziest buffets I have ever seen, also its full of clebrity chef's",Happy
636," Yeah, the food is good. easy to put on the pounds. i dont like to gamble. it is boring. the shows can be good too.",Neutral
636,Yea I have never been into losing money! Do they still have breakfast available at all hours there?,Curious to dive deeper
636," Yeah, probably, but i would avoid the cheap stuff. you could get sick. the high end is quite good. talk to the limo drivers. they can give you advice.",Neutral
636,That's how it is just about anywhere the people driving always know the best places to go!,Curious to dive deeper
636," Yes, always chat with the limo drivers. give them a $5 tip for their thoughts. you will have a better vegas experience.",Neutral
636,Very true. Do you own any fish?,Happy
636," I do not. never have. they look pretty, but they are not very loving.",Neutral
636," Thats very true, where I am currently in the Czech Republic we have these fish called Lamprey. They are pretty scary looking!",Curious to dive deeper
636,Are those fish with the huge jaws and razor sharp teeth? Not very cuddly.,Neutral
636,Yea they look like big leeches with a row of teeth circling there entire mouth! They also only drink water through there skin!,Happy
636,Hm. that is interesting! Fish seem interesting. There is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal. wouldnt that get boring though?,Neutral
636,It would but what if the black swallower get ahold of you?,Happy
636," Um, i guess i would eat my way out of its guts? I can be pretty determined and have quite an appetite. ",Neutral
636,I never thought about that! Did you know 84% of genes known to be associated with human disease have counterparts in the zebrafish?,Surprised
636," I figure we could learn a heap from them zebrafish. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
636," Its been great chatting with you, have a great night!",Happy
636,Have a great weekend!,Neutral
636,Bye!,Surprised
637,Have you ever had pet fish?,Curious to dive deeper
637,I think I had fish when I was little. They are interesting though. My daughter has a fish in her preschool classroom and loves it,Neutral
637,I guess fish is not actually a formal taxonomic group. There are so many types of fish. Did you know there is a type of jellyfish that is immortal?,Surprised
637," I did not before now. I find it interesting also that freshwater fish only drink water through their skin via osmosis, while saltwater fish drink through their mouth. Its odd that they are different.",Surprised
637," Right. I wonder how the freshwater fish prevents from drinking through its mouth. Seahorses are also odd creatures. They look weird, maybe because they are the only fish with a neck.",Curious to dive deeper
637," I think all fish are weird. When I go out fishing with my husband I don't touch the fish. Yuck!! I have never heard of a black swallower fish, but it sounds creepy that it can eat prey twice its length and 10 times its weight. Where would it go?",Curious to dive deeper
637," I guess it expands a lot! I don't like eating fish. I think they are kind of gross. I do like aquariums, though.",Surprised
637," I don't eat fish either. Aquariums are fun. It is so fun to see aquatic animals. Changing the subject... What do you think about the fact that Judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode?",Neutral
637," That's quite a bit, but I find it hard to believe she is the highest paid celebrity after Lebron James. I thought some other actors made more than that. Maybe it's the number of episodes she makes.",Curious to dive deeper
637," Well her television show is on every day. It isn't like a once a week thing. When you consider that, I am sure it equals out a lot. I am surprised to learn that Robin Williams was the first actor to perform in animated films.",Curious to dive deeper
637,Society loves our celebrities! So much that we have apparently needed to see them on Sesame Street. Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear.,Surprised
637,Society does love celebrities. It is interesting that we have this love/hate relationship with people we don't even know. Did you know that the most popular hat in the old west wasn't a cowboy hat? My mind is blown. It was a bowler.,Curious to dive deeper
637,That's very funny that we have come to associate cowboy hats with anything western.,Surprised
637," So I am from Michigan, and I know nothing about cowboys, or really the Western half of the US too much. Everything I know is basically what I've seen on television, and what little I learned about the expanion in School.",Neutral
637," Yeah, I don't know much either except for what I hear from TV. Going back to hats, I find it funny that until 1998 British politicians had to wear a top hat if they were making a point of order in the house of commons.",Surprised
637,I think that speaks to the generation. Hats used to be more formal. Tipping ones hat originates fro knights raising their face visors to show friendliness. Its funny how one tradition can lead to another.,Curious to dive deeper
637,Dunce caps are another funny one. They represented foolish behavior.,Surprised
637," Well foolish behavior always needs to be encouraged :) I find it interesting that in 1908 they had to pass a law regarding the limit of hatpins, out of fear they'd be used as weapons. A fashion statement that had to be controlled out of fear.",Curious to dive deeper
637,I'll have to keep that in mind when deciding on a self defense weapon. Watch out for my hatpin!,Happy
637," Haha. Yes, it has a dual purpose for one to look good, and for two, don't mess with me, I've got a hatpin. Which back in the day that might actually be a legit concern.",Curious to dive deeper
637," Yes, hats aren't so widely used anymore but they do still play a big role in society.",Happy
637,Yes for sure. NIce speaking with you,Happy
638," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
638,I'm great! How are you?,Neutral
638,I am well. Have you ever been to Vegas?,Curious to dive deeper
638,I've been once of twice. Have you been?,Neutral
638,I have. I usually only go to the cheap restaurants. My time is spent gambling and drinking. What do you enjoy there?,Curious to dive deeper
638,I usually try to catch some of the shows. There are some upscale restaurants too.,Neutral
638,I have not been in a long time though. Ever sine my wife gave me culture.,Happy
638," That's very kind and thoughtful of your wife to give you culture. When you have a chance, please remember to return it to her. Do you wear hats on occasion?",Neutral
638,I try to give her as much grace as I can. We have 2 kids and I try to take them as much as I can so she can have some personal time. I do love hats.,Happy
638," Which would you prefer, a bowler or a cowboy hat? The most popular hat in the old west was the bowler, not the cowboy hat.",Neutral
638,Bowler! I find it to be so funny looking. I chuckle everytime I see it! What about you? What do you prefer?,Happy
638," I usually wear a baseball cap. I probably should wear a dunce cap, too. The origins of the conical party hat was derived from dunce caps, worn at parties to encourage foolish behavior",Neutral
638,You could wear it to british parliment if you were going to make a point...,Happy
638,Wearing a point to make a point of order. Are you interested in our friends beneath the water?,Curious to dive deeper
638,I am. Are you?,Curious to dive deeper
638," They are interesting, and can be quite tasty. There is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal. Something about that seems unfair.",Neutral
638,I think we should study that so we can live longer. I have a pension and could use another few years of wealth for my future generations!,Happy
638," But what will you do with your time? Immortality goes on for quite a while. Fish don't have to be entertained, but we do.",Neutral
638,Netflix! There's so many options there. Or I could work and grow my fortune even more! Like vampires do. Why do you think . they are so rich?,Curious to dive deeper
638,I thought they stole stuff from their victims and sold it on eBay. Hm. Netflix probably should do a better job catering to vampire viewership.,Neutral
638,I DONT WANT TO STEAL! Just live a long time and get rich. Nice chatting with you!,Happy
639,Did you enjoy the Harry Porrer series?,Curious to dive deeper
639,I only saw like the first 2. Did you?,Curious to dive deeper
639," I watched them all yeah, and also the new movies, Fantastice Beasts and Where to Find Them",Curious to dive deeper
639," Oh ok, have you seen starship troopers?",Curious to dive deeper
639," Yeah that was a nice movie, I hear its also a good book",Curious to dive deeper
639," Well 3 out of 5 military branches are require to read it. I don't recall it being that good, but hey what do i know. ",Curious to dive deeper
639," Enders Game is another book recommened for military organizations, havent read the book, the movie was alright",Curious to dive deeper
639,This tells me that they are preparing for the children to run the country.,Curious to dive deeper
639," Who knows, books are a powerfull tool, in the 18th century they even caused a moral panic",Curious to dive deeper
639,Really what about?,Curious to dive deeper
639," Because of the spread of novels, guess they werent prepared for them, its an odd thing though",Curious to dive deeper
639," Yeah knowledge is power, some institution fear for it's communities. Do you speed read?",Curious to dive deeper
639," I do, im pretty slow at it but I  try to read fast, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
639," Unfortunately i didn't get that trait. If i'm not careful i could be 15 minutes in before i realize i have no ideal whats going on. lol. However i hear the record for speed reading is 4,700 words. ",Curious to dive deeper
639," 4,700 per minute? thats really fast, who holds the record?",Curious to dive deeper
639,A young lady by the name of Anne Jones. I think it's cool that it is a women.,Curious to dive deeper
639," It is cool, she must be really smart, do you like Cs Lewis or Tolkien?",Curious to dive deeper
639,I'm not sure iv'e ever seen him. What does he do?,Curious to dive deeper
639," they are both authors and used to have a competition concerning poetry, terrible poetry to be exact.",Curious to dive deeper
639,Wow that sounds like it would be kind of funny. So im told that Hogwarts is located in Scotland not England in the HP universe.,Curious to dive deeper
639," I always thought it was England, J.K Rowling is a great author. ",Curious to dive deeper
640,Do you enjoy the Star Wars movies?,Curious to dive deeper
640,I do. Do you,Curious to dive deeper
640,I do. I'm not a super fan but I like them. Did you know that James Earl Jones only spent 2.5 hours recording the dialogue for Darth Vader?,Curious to dive deeper
640,I thought it would have been so much more than 2.5 hours!,Surprised
640,I would have thought so too. And he was only paid $7.500!,Surprised
640," Man. I know that was in 1977 but that's not a lot of money. I realize $7500 for 2.5 hours of work is good but, man that's really shocking. Like Marcia being the brains behind it!",Surprised
640,I had heard that as well. She was the reason for Obi Won's death and Leia's good luck kiss.,Neutral
640," I did not like Obi's death. When I first saw that movie, I was like 7 and cried! I was so sad...",Sad
640,Oh no. It is sad. Did you know that Star Wars has been dubbed in Navajo?,Curious to dive deeper
640,I did not know that. That is cool. That makes it the first one!,Surprised
640,Yes it is. Were you also aware that Fox thought Star Wars was going to be a flop?,Curious to dive deeper
640,They really underestimated that one... They let hm keep the merchandising too!,Surprised
640," Yes they did. It worked out for Lucas. He gave up $500,000 in order to keep the merchandising rights. He's a billionaire just because of that!",Surprised
640,Man... Did you know spielberg played clarinet on the jaws soundtrack? Did they run out of money for musicians?,Surprised
640,I did not. I didn't even know he could play the clarinet. Jaws has such memorable music too. I do know that the soundtrack for O Brother Where Art Thou is 8 times platinum.,Neutral
640,Wow. I would have never thought that... I didn't even see that movie. Batman begins features tracks of different genus of bats.,Surprised
640,I did not know that either. It's very clever. Speaking of music do you like The Ramones?,Curious to dive deeper
640,I do. Do you like them?,Curious to dive deeper
640," I do. They toured almost nonstop for 20 years and performed 2,263 concerts!",Surprised
640,That's a long time! Like going to a Creed concert!,Happy
640,Not a fan of them. I heard they performed so poorly at a concert that some attendees sued them.,Neutral
641," Did you read the article about the composer of the Star Wars movie ""The Last Jedi"" ?",Curious to dive deeper
641," I did, I thought that it was so amazing that it was called the best movie score of all time. That's so fitting for one of the most popular sagas to ever exist!",Curious to dive deeper
641," I've never actually seen a Star Wars movie from start to finish, so I don't actually know much other than the most famous songs. I didn't realize how much money they made either.",Neutral
641," I'm not surprised you knew some of the songs at least, for how long ago the films came out I hear children today even love the tunes like ""The Imperial March"". You need to watch the films! How much did they make?",Curious to dive deeper
641," Apparently 8.5 billion dollars, which is pretty wild. Still not the most money made from a film series though, only 2nd place",Curious to dive deeper
641,I can't believe that Fox thought the films would flop! It's too bad for them that they didn't keep the licensing and merchandising rights because of their doubts and lost out on billions of dollars.,Curious to dive deeper
641," I think that's pretty normal for Fox, didn't they do the same thing with Family Guy and probably many other series that people love?",Curious to dive deeper
641," Yes, you're probably right! Still I'd have a really tough time getting over the loss of around 65 billion dollars for the whole star wars franchise. ",Curious to dive deeper
641,I just can't believe they haven't gone under after making such bad decisions. Especially knowing these franchises are loved by basically everyone it seems.,Surprised
641," I know, but I think that's just how the entertainment industry seems to work. They are probably really rich.",Neutral
641," Yes, defintely they are rich, at least the people who own Fox. Also the people in the movie too, since James Earl Jones earned $7500 for 2.5 hours worth of recordings",Surprised
641," I was actually thinking that that didn't sound like much money for such a huge role. I know that even George Lucas was supposed to be paid 500k alone just as a ""directing fee""",Curious to dive deeper
641,I would love to work for $3000/hr. Seems like you wouldn't need to get too many jobs in order to have a liveable salary,Curious to dive deeper
641," Meanwhile, entertainers in the music industry seem to work very hard- like Linkin Park performing 324 concerts in 2001 alone.",Curious to dive deeper
641," That is a lot of concerts, wow. That's probably more working days than most people ever think about doing in a year",Curious to dive deeper
641,Yeah and other famous bands like the Ramones toured non stop for twenty years straight,Curious to dive deeper
641," I guess if you're doing what you love it really doesn't seem like work. Sometimes you don't even need an audience to play live, like Pink Floyd did in 1972",Curious to dive deeper
641,And not just without an audience but some musicians like the members of Creed will keep trying even after being sued by four unhappy concert goers.,Happy
641,I can't even imagine a concert being so bad you get sued by the people there. It must have been very bad. That's got to be a sign that maybe you should find something else.,Disgusted
641," Yeah, and you don't necessarily have to give up music either, the guitarist of Radiohead Johnny Greenwood ended up becoming a succesful indie classical composer. ",Curious to dive deeper
641," I'd want to be the person who just names the titles of songs, like they did on the Batman Begins soundtrack where it was either a genus or family of bats",Happy
642," Hi there, are you a fan of Star Wars?",Curious to dive deeper
642,Yes I am.  Been a fan since a kid!  George Lucas created a monster when he made the first Star Wars movie in 1977.,Happy
642,And it also holds the Guiness World Record for the Most successful film merchandising franchise. That is mind blowing,Curious to dive deeper
642,I believe it!  In 2018 the franchise was estimated to be valued at 65 billion dollars!,Happy
642,That is amazing. Did you know his wife made major changes to the film that led to her winning an Academy Award?,Curious to dive deeper
642," I didn't know that.  She was in the right place at the right time. lol  When it was released, 20th Century Fox thought it was going to flop.  Boy were they wrong.",Happy
642,Yup pretty wrong about that one. It ia also the first major film to be dubbed on Navajo.,Curious to dive deeper
642,That's interesting!  James Earl Jones only spent 2.5 hours recording Darth Vader's lines for the original movie.  Pretty fast worker.,Happy
642,Yeah and he only made $7500 from it but I wonder if he got any royalties after,Curious to dive deeper
642,Good question.  I'm sure he had to have made something.  The franchise made George Lucas a billionaire!,Happy
642," He played it smart, he paid a little money to keep the licensing and merchandising rights to himself. $500 000 well spent",Curious to dive deeper
642,No doubt!  Do you like going to concerts?,Happy
642," I do actually, but only when I have time. DId you know Linkin Park played 324 concerts in 2001?",Curious to dive deeper
642," I didn't know that.  Wow.  That's a lot of concerts in one year.  The Ramones played non-stop over 20 years playing a total of 2,363 concerts.",Happy
642," That just blows my mind, did they not get tired? Wow. I wonder if they played in the ancient theater in Croatia?",Curious to dive deeper
642,They might have!  lol  Pink Floyd played at an ancient,Happy
642," Yeah they did but the theater was empty, no audience. Wonder how that idea came about",Curious to dive deeper
642," You knew about it!  cool!  Sorry I hit the enter button by accident.  In 2002 the band Creed played a show that was so bad that 4 of the concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band.  They must have been really, really bad.",Happy
642," No worries. Yeah, I am glad I have never had such an experience at a concert, at least so far. Speaking of music, did you know that Spielberg was the one to play the clarinet in the Jaws soundtrack?",Curious to dive deeper
642,I had no idea!  The soundtrack to O'Brother Where art Thou? is cerfified 8 times platinum!  Loved that movie and the music in it.,Happy
642," Yeah that is true, they did a great job there. Nice chatting with you",Happy
643,Do you know what the dodo bird looks like?,Curious to dive deeper
643," No, I do not.  What does a dodo bird look like?",Curious to dive deeper
643," lol, they say its from the pigeon family! I love birds and have watched them make nest.",Happy
643," Apparently, hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests.  Lazy birds!",Curious to dive deeper
643," Ha, ha, ha, right! I wonder how many days it takes birds to fly without sleeping from Alaska to Mexico?",Curious to dive deeper
643,I don't know. I wonder if at least they rest somewhere along the way.  That was an interesting fact.,Surprised
643,I would think they would have to! But they must not stay long or sleep and keep going.,Curious to dive deeper
643," Apparently, in most birds, bones are so hollow that the entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers.",Surprised
643," I never thought about that the feathers would weight more, but it makes sense. African grey parrots as well some wild birds in Australia can mimic alot of different sounds and noises.",Curious to dive deeper
643,Please tell me what types of sounds or noises they can mimic.,Curious to dive deeper
643,lol I had an African grey that could say everything I said around the house. Like clean your room! as well any loud sounds.,Happy
643,That's interesting.  I did not know that there were two types of birds that had no wing.  They are extinct though.,Surprised
643,That's interesting!  Were they called moa and elephant birds?,Curious to dive deeper
643,Yes they were.  Do you have more uncommon facts about birds?  Have you seen bee hummingbird ?  They are only 2 inches in size.,Curious to dive deeper
643,I have a hummingbird feeder and its interesting to watch them flutter their wings while eating. Are you interested in comedy films? Bill Murray was always funny!,Curious to dive deeper
643,I like comedy films.  Do you like Bill Murray?  Which one is his best comedy film?,Curious to dive deeper
643," He has a few, the first I can remember is Caddyshack. I never watched 3rd rock from the sun, Was it any good?",Curious to dive deeper
643," I have not seen that one.  Are you familiar with a comedian, Demetri Martin?  Apparently, he was accepted into Harvard law but left out of boredom and decided to pursue a career in comedy.  ",Curious to dive deeper
643," No, I'm not familiar but I bet he's really talented to leave Harvard Law. Ryan Stiles dropped out of high school to do comedy too!",Surprised
643," Life is short.  I think you should pursue your dream, if you can.   I like Ryan Stiles.  ",Neutral
643,I agree with you on that! Live each day to the fullest!! Good chat!!,Happy
643,It was nice chatting with you.  Have a nice day!,Neutral
644," hey there, do you like nature and animals?",Curious to dive deeper
644,Why yes I most certainly do. Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
644," Yes, I really like all animals and especially birds.",Happy
644,Have you ever watched the Paddington 2?,Curious to dive deeper
644,No I have not. is that a kid friendly movie?,Curious to dive deeper
644,Yes it is about a lovable talking bear,Curious to dive deeper
644,oh ok that is cool. do you like horror films?,Curious to dive deeper
644,I do like horror films. Insidious was a good one I watched that focuses on a paranormal investigator and her sidekicks.,Neutral
644," I cannot bring myself to watch them really. I might when I need to go on a diet though, as you burn more calories",Surprised
644,My girlfriend also cannot watch them so I have not really seen many horror films the last 3 years.,Sad
644,apparently if you watch a horror movie and then see abstract art you enjoy the art more,Curious to dive deeper
644,Very fascinating fact. I would love to see Liam Neesen in the commuter movie.,Happy
644,do you know what a waterphone is?,Curious to dive deeper
644," no I do not, what is it?",Curious to dive deeper
644,it is an instrument they use to make sounds in horror movies,Surprised
644,Did you know that crows are the most intelligent birds?,Curious to dive deeper
644,I had heard about it when I read that they drop hard shelled foods in the pavement where cars pass by so they can crack them with tires,Surprised
644,Very fascinating that crows figured out how to do that!,Curious to dive deeper
644," yeah, very smart creatures. have you seen pictures of the dodo bird?",Curious to dive deeper
644," I have not, that is a funny name for a bird.",Happy
644,Unfortunately it is a bird that has been extinct and was in the family of pigeons,Curious to dive deeper
644,Very sad for the dodo bird.,Sad
644,i know and for many other species that have gone extinct over the time too,Curious to dive deeper
644,Moa and elephant birds also are extinct.,Curious to dive deeper
644,yeah too bad. birds are amazing though. nice chatting with you,Happy
645," I did not know that the sun is actually white, did you?",Surprised
645," Yea, I heard the sun is perceived as yellow due to atmospheric scattering",Neutral
645," Yeah that amazes me. Kind of like a lighting bolt being hotter than the sun, wow!",Curious to dive deeper
645,Well the surface of the Sun isn't the hottest part of the sun so I can see how a lightning bolt can be 5x hotter,Neutral
645," I wonder how much energy a lighting bolt could produce then since the sun can produce enough in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500,000 years.",Curious to dive deeper
645," I don't know but the sun does have 330,000 times the mass of the earth",Neutral
645," Good point, but it's only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star in our galaxy. ",Curious to dive deeper
645,It's crazy that the sun is 99.86% the total mass of the solar system yet so small compared to other stars,Surprised
645,I know so much we have not discovered. Do you like animals? There are 20 quintillion individual animal on planet earth.,Curious to dive deeper
645," Yea, it's insane that there are 1 million species of insects",Surprised
645,did you ever hear that when a animal is domesticated that it develops a white patch on it's forehead?,Curious to dive deeper
645," No, i think I'm gonna go see if their is white patch on my dog's forehead",Neutral
645,Right i never noticed that either. Do you like fiction?,Curious to dive deeper
645,I like to read novels and short story fiction,Neutral
645,Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction. Do you know what of?,Curious to dive deeper
645,I heard Caesar wrote about Hercules and Oedipus as a kid,Neutral
645,That's right! Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest examples of a cyborg in fiction.,Curious to dive deeper
645,I like reading Edgar Allen Poe but haven't heard of stories involving cyborgs,Surprised
645,Yeah and apparently Wiki ranks fictional character according to their powers and abilities.,Curious to dive deeper
645,Nice. Did you know George RR Martin dislikes fan fiction?,Neutral
645,I did because he said it infringed on copyrights and was a bad exercise for aspiring writers. Not sure if i agree with that.,Curious to dive deeper
645,Well I have to go. See ya,Neutral
646," Hello, do you know a lot about the Solar System?",Curious to dive deeper
646," Well, the center of our solar system is the sun, which provides the majority of energy to support life on Earth.",Curious to dive deeper
646," True, and it is very important to the earth as a source of energy. Can't get by without that!",Curious to dive deeper
646,The sun evidently produces a type of solar music that can be picked up by a radio station that can change solar activity into sound. That would be interesting to hear.,Curious to dive deeper
646," Sure would. It also makes enough energy in 1 second to cover the needs of the whole planet for 500,000 years.",Curious to dive deeper
646,It also provides life-giving support to over 7 million living animal species.,Curious to dive deeper
646,Crazy! Did you know that it is actually white and only visible as being yellow because of atmospheric scattering?,Curious to dive deeper
646,Our solar system has given a lot of opportunity for some great sci-fi movies,Curious to dive deeper
646," Yeah, creepy though that the sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System. That is a huge percentage.",Curious to dive deeper
646,True. The earth is a little pin hole.,Curious to dive deeper
646,Yeah it amounts to the sun being 109 times that of earth. What a monster!,Curious to dive deeper
646,Did you know that sunset on Mars in blue?,Curious to dive deeper
646,Really? Wonder if any animals live there like the 20 quintillion on earth.,Curious to dive deeper
646,Don't think so. It's like a ball of fire rotating as a solid body. The equator rotates faster than the poles.,Curious to dive deeper
646," Ok, guess not then. Hey, are you a reader? Like fiction?",Curious to dive deeper
646," Yes. I love fiction. The term ""robotics"" was coined by Isaac Asimov in 1941. ",Curious to dive deeper
646,So do I. I never heard of Asimov. Seems kinda early in the 1900s for such a modern word.,Curious to dive deeper
646,1941 actually. A new fiction novel coming out around 2020 election is centered on communicating from the afterlife. Do you like stuff like that?,Curious to dive deeper
646,No not really a fan of that type of novels. I am more into Edgar Allen Poe. He wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction.,Curious to dive deeper
646," He was a great author, but I think he was a little strange. ",Curious to dive deeper
646,Well that's probably true of lots of them..lol! Hey nice chatting with you. Have a great day!,Neutral
647,Hello. I love good weather all thanks to the sun! It is a perfect sphere of hot plasma!,Curious to dive deeper
647,Me too. I saw that the sun is actually really white.,Surprised
647,Yes you're correct but it only appears yellow because of atmospheric scattering.,Surprised
647,Very cool. Did you know a lightening bolt is actually 5 times hotter than the surface of the sun?,Surprised
647,I hope I never get struck by one! Surprisingly the sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star in our galaxy.,Surprised
647,Me either lol. That's pretty small then in comparison to the other stars. I would have never imagined that.,Surprised
647,Yes me too. The sun is definitely the most important source of energy for life on earth. It accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the solar system.,Surprised
647," Definitely. It produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of our planet for 500,000 years which is amazing.",Surprised
647," That is so cool. It makes sense though since the mass of the sun is about 330,000 times that of earth.",Surprised
647,For sure. Do you like animals?,Curious to dive deeper
647," Yes I love animals. There have been around 1.5 million species described, so plenty for everyone to have a favorite!",Happy
647,That's a lot of species. I saw there are 20 quintillion animals on Earth.,Surprised
647,That is amazing and I can't even fathom that much. The study of animals is called zoology and they must be busy with all those animals!,Surprised
647,For sure. Animals get white patches on their heads when they are domesticated.,Surprised
647,Oh maybe that explains why there are so many white patches on dogs. If you are annoyed when you get hiccups just remember they are a hold over from early evolution.,Curious to dive deeper
647,Definitely. That's interesting about hiccups. That would have been so cool to have lungs and gills.,Surprised
647,Yes I would love to breathe underwater. The country of Scotland has a protection act against the Loch Ness monster. Do you think it exists?,Curious to dive deeper
647,That would be awesome to breathe underwater. That's hilarious for something that might not even exist.,Surprised
647,Yes I think so too. And this happened all in 1912! Well it was great chatting with you.,Happy
647,Animals are pretty fascinating to study. It was good chatting with you too!,Happy
647,Have a good one!,Happy
648," Hello, how are you doing tonight?",Curious to dive deeper
648,Great. Are you into baseball?  Funny that MLB managers wear uniforms since they can actually play in the game.,Surprised
648," Yea, I wonder how often that has ever happened though!",Happy
648,Maybe many years ago...  Baseball is really popular in Japan to the point that Japanese fans are surprised to learn that it's the US's national pastime.,Surprised
648,I was just at a Japanese baseball game a few months ago! It was amazing.,Curious to dive deeper
648," Wow, that's great.  Have you seen a kickball game in Canada?  I guess they call it soccer-baseball.",Surprised
648,They would name it that! Almost reminds me of that movie with the producers of South Park.,Curious to dive deeper
648,Yeah.  Do you play golf? Babe Ruth was once the USA's most famous golfer.,Surprised
648," I don't play golf, not many courses here in the Czech Republic! How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
648," When it's warm.  You're English is good. Are you a native Czech?  Golf courses use a lot of water.  An average course uses 312,000 gallons of water a day! (many liters)",Surprised
648,I grew up in Ohio for most of my childhood! That's alot of water. Did you know there is a golf course in dubai that requires 4 million gallons of water a day?,Curious to dive deeper
648," I can believe that.  Speaking of Babe Ruth, he was caught stealing to end game 7 in the 1926 World Series.  His team was down one run.  Sad for the Bambino...",Surprised
648,That is sad. Did you ever hear about Samuel L Jacksons golf clause?,Curious to dive deeper
648," Yeah, he gets to play 2 times a week.  No surprise, the women's World Cup got more TV viewers than the US World Series. ",Surprised
648,I can only imagine why! Did you know Babe ruth actually got caught stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 world series when his team was only down by 1 run.,Curious to dive deeper
648," Yes, I mentioned that above...  Did you know that the Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win back-to-back World Series?",Curious to dive deeper
648," You did, wow long night tonight! I did'nt know that!",Surprised
648," Did you know about the MLB controversy over the composition of the ball.  I guess since it was changed, there have been a lot more homeruns.",Surprised
648," I hear some things about players thinking that the ball was rigged, but anyway its been nice talking to you, sorry for that brain lapse!",Surprised
648," No problem.  Curious, how are Americans perceived in Czechoslovakia?   Trump? On the ball thing, I guess they did many studies on the ball's drag.  They had a lot of trouble nailing it down.  It remains something of a mystery.",Curious to dive deeper
648," Czech Republic and Slovakia split up several years ago, we are 2 different places! As far as Americans go they are welcomed! Take care!",Curious to dive deeper
648," Thanks.  I have a good friend from Belgrade.  He says they like Trump there.  Clinton bombed them... Thank you, you were great!",Curious to dive deeper
649,Have you heard about Idra Novey? Her second novel those who knew is apparently a very good book,Curious to dive deeper
649,No I have not. What is the book about?,Curious to dive deeper
649," Well it apparently deals with death, which is not very uplifting, but it involves a revolutionary figure apparently",Neutral
649,It sounds interesting. I like fiction and also non fiction like scientific things about space or animals. Did you know that Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known cyborg in fiction.,Curious to dive deeper
649,No I didn't but that sounds really cool. I'd have to check that book out haha. What do you think about Julius Caesar writing fanfiction for Hercules by the way,Surprised
649," I really like history, that is so interesting. Well I suppose George RR Martin would disagree, he despises fan fiction.",Surprised
649,Yeah he does hate it. He considers that to be copyright infringement which is weird to me,Sad
649,I agree. Did you know that the lochness monster is a protected species?,Neutral
649," Yes I thought that was crazy, Scotland passed a animal protection act back in 1912 in order to protect the Loch Ness monster LOL I hope it's real by the way",Surprised
649," I know right. Another animal fact, in 2002 Germany was the first country to give animals constitutionally guaranteed legal rights?",Neutral
649,Wow I didn't know that. I wonder what kind of Rights those include? Do you know? I also wonder why animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated,Surprised
649," I didn't know that, that is strange. Did you know that Hiccups are a holdover in early evolution when animals had both lungs and gills. So bizarre. ",Surprised
649,Wow that is very crazy. What is your favorite animal by the way? I know that I really like dogs,Curious to dive deeper
649,I really like dogs also but overall I would say a tiger.,Happy
649,A pet tiger would be awesome! Do you know anything about the Sun by the way? Apparently it's actually white and not yellow,Surprised
649," Yes that is because of the atmospheric scattering. The sun produces enough energy in one second for the entire earth for 500,000 years! ",Surprised
649," Wow that's crazy! We should try to harvest that, but it makes sense because the sun is 100 times the diameter of Earth actually",Surprised
649,The sun is only 1 billionth the size of the largest star that we have discovered in our galaxy,Surprised
649,That makes the Sun seem really small LOL what do you think about the fact that it takes Neptune almost an entire Century to rotate around the sun,Surprised
649,Wow that is a long time. The Sun is 109 times larger than the Earth and accounts for almost 100% of the solar systems mass.,Surprised
649,Yeah that's very impressive! I don't think people appreciate that the sun is by far the most important source of energy for our life on Earth,Happy
650,do you like baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
650,I do even though I prefer football.  Why did you ask?,Curious to dive deeper
650," I was wondering if it interest you,  I learned some fun facts recently. Baseball managers can technically play if needed. ",Curious to dive deeper
650," In order for managers to play, they need to know how to play baseball though.  ",Curious to dive deeper
650,I am pretty sure they know how to play baseball considering they are baseball managers...........,Curious to dive deeper
650," Are they physically fit though.  For instant, in a different sport, managers do not have to play.   the notre dame manager before the current one was very fat.  He knew how to manage the team but he could not play football in a million years.  What I'm asking is if the baseball managers need to be able to play baseball effectively.  Is this true that opposing team will receive three bases if a player catches a baseball in their hat?",Curious to dive deeper
650," The fun fact is that they are able to play IF NEEDED. They dress up in uniform just in case,  baseball teams have like 20 players though hes probably not needed and hes probably not fit.  That wasnt the point though. ",Curious to dive deeper
650," I see what you mean.  I'm not very familiar with baseball rules.  Apparently, the Chicago cubs were the first baseball team to win back to back in the world series but they have not won since then.",Neutral
650,Thats interesting.  I hear in canada kick ball is called soccer-baseball lol,Curious to dive deeper
650," I did not know that.  160,000 balls are used for a typical major league baseball season.  It is such a waste and is not good for the environment ",Curious to dive deeper
650,I recently found out that Japan like baseball and they didnt even know it was an american pastime lol,Curious to dive deeper
650,That was funny.  Another funny fact:  The Albuquerque minor league baseball team was named after the baseball team in the Simpsons!,Surprised
650,Oh thats awesome love the simpsons great show.,Curious to dive deeper
650," It is.  I like it too.  Apparently, the World Series was started in 1903.  I did not know that.",Surprised
650,Babe ruth was once americas most famous golfer lol,Curious to dive deeper
650,I did not know that.  I learn a lot while chatting with people.  I read an article that the women's world cup had higher television ratings than the world series in the US.  That was strange.,Surprised
650,Thats cool.  I wish I had samuel l jackson schedule he gets to golf twice a week lol,Curious to dive deeper
650,I do knot know that Samuel Jackson is a golfer.  Kim Jong-ill of North Korea scored 11 holes-in-one in his first and only round of golf.,Curious to dive deeper
650,Thats impressive.  he has time to golf?,Curious to dive deeper
650," He is the boss.  He can do whatever he wants.  When you said about Samuel Jackson, is he the actor?",Curious to dive deeper
650," Yeah pretty famous,  pulp fiction,  marvel avengers,  etc.  Its been great talking,  have a good one. ",Curious to dive deeper
651," Hi Turker, did you know with 50 state in the union there are 100 US Senators?",Surprised
651," Yep I did know that. each state gets two senators actually. So you're right about that. I think it's interesting that the Senators used to be elected by the states, but obviously now they are elected by the people",Surprised
651," Yes that true,I wonder at times the what reason did the change took place. I may read upon that sometime.",Curious to dive deeper
651," Yes I think it was from 1789 until 1913, but I am curious as to why they changed it, even though it makes a lot more sense to me. Did you hear about when Richard Nixon cracked the 165 year-old gavel by the way?",Curious to dive deeper
651," No, I didn't know that. Did you know women weren't allowed to wear pants on the us senate floor until 1993, wow.",Surprised
651,No I didn't know that! That seems so backwards. And also kind of sad. Hopefully those women got to get into the Senate drawer with all the candy though LOL have you heard about that,Curious to dive deeper
651," Yes, I wonder why so much candies, I was told back in the day was more a man control world, especially when it comes to women.",Curious to dive deeper
651,Yes that's the way it was unfortunately. I would love to get into that candy drawer right now though haha. I love Mars Bars and milky Way's and jelly beans lol. I'm actually really hungry just thinking about it,Curious to dive deeper
651," I was thinking the same thing earlier, hahaha are you familiar with the ex-basketball player Michael Jordan?",Curious to dive deeper
651,Yes I've heard of him. I loved when he would play he was so good! Did you hear what he said when someone asked why he wasn't endorsing a Democratic candidate?,Curious to dive deeper
651," Yes, that was a little cold of him, because republicans brought his shoes too.",Curious to dive deeper
651," Yep, but I did like how he just stayed out of politics, I think too many celebrities get involved and it just messes everything up. Speaking of politics, do you ever watch Fox News?",Curious to dive deeper
651," I may have watched Fox News once or twice, not that I have anything against it, because I pretty much know what's true or false, but I like CBS,NBC or News 19.",Curious to dive deeper
651," Yep that's kind of what you have to keep in mind, is that most news is biased. I didn't know though that Fox News owned ign.com which is a video game website, I never would have figured that out",Curious to dive deeper
651," wow I didn't either, don't you know fox news is watched more than cnn and msnbc combined?",Surprised
651,No I didn't know that. I wonder why that is? It's also scary that Fox News tried to sue The Simpsons when they were making fun of them too much.,Surprised
651," Wow, fox news was created by republican media richard ailes and president richard nixon.",Curious to dive deeper
651," That is really crazy. I didn't know that Richard Nixon was involved in Fox News. Also I was wondering, because the Simpsons is owned by Fox, if Fox News sued The Simpsons would they be suing themselves? How would that even work",Curious to dive deeper
651," You are right unless fox didn't own the simpsons until after the lawsuit, I really don't know how that work.",Surprised
651,What do you know about clothes by the way? Did you know that the pilgrims did not actually wear those black clothes all the time?,Curious to dive deeper
651," No, I didn't know that, I don't clothes shop that often. It was nice chatting with you.",Curious to dive deeper
652," hi there, do you know much about US senate?",Curious to dive deeper
652,I know a little.  What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
652,I know they keep a drawer that is stuffed with candy there,Curious to dive deeper
652," Yeah, I heard about that candy drawer.  Too funny.It's currently supplied with candy made in Pennsylvania.",Happy
652," Yeah all the brands that I like too, Milky Way, Mars, and jellybeans",Curious to dive deeper
652," Cool, those are some of my favorites, too. ",Happy
652,Yeah so tasty. Did you kmnow they had a gavel for 165 years before Nixon broke it,Curious to dive deeper
652,Ha Ha.  He would have been the person to crack it.  I heard that women weren't allowed to wear pants until 1993.,Surprised
652,Good thing those two senators stages a protest and now they get to wear whatever they like,Curious to dive deeper
652," That's so crazy, it took so long for that to happen.",Surprised
652,yeah unfortunately. Do you have favorite clothes?,Curious to dive deeper
652," Not really, I wear mostly jeans and tshirts.",Neutral
652," Nice, do you like monocolor or colorful shirts?",Curious to dive deeper
652," I'm like the pilgrims, I like colorful clothing.  You know they only wore black for special occasions.",Curious to dive deeper
652,That is pretty cool. Even apple had a clothing line,Curious to dive deeper
652," I didn't know that.  Have you ever been to the store in Alabama that sells only clothes, cameras, etc. found in unclaimed baggage at airports?",Curious to dive deeper
652,I have not but now I would like to visit that. DO you know how fashinistas tell if clothes need to be tailored?,Curious to dive deeper
652," Yeah, they look for collar gaps on your clothes, I think.",Surprised
652,Yesh that is it. Have you heard of the brand rip curl?,Curious to dive deeper
652," Yeah, they say they make their clothes in China, but actually they're made in North Korea.",Surprised
652,Yeah that one. Nice chatting with you.,Happy
653," Good morning, do you listen to a lot of music?",Curious to dive deeper
653," Yes.  I span many genre, but like classic country and classic rock the best.  I still have vinyl albums in the attic from my youth in the 70s and 80s.  And you? ",Curious to dive deeper
653,I listen to all sorts as well. I think rock is my favorite genre.,Happy
653," Were you ever into the electric guitar instrumentals of the 50s and 60s, like the Ventures?",Curious to dive deeper
653," I play a little guitar, not as good as any of those bands though.",Neutral
653," I cannot play, but I do like good clean instrumentals.  About a year ago, Nokie Edwards, lead guitarist of the Ventures died.  ""Secret Agent Man"" is on of my favorite Venture's tunes.  I listen to the MP3 when I need a pick me up.",Curious to dive deeper
653,I know the song but did not know who the band was behind it. I like that song as well.,Surprised
653," So, do you play acoustical or electric guitar?",Curious to dive deeper
653," I have an electric guitar, I never owned an acoustic one. I personally prefer the sound of the electric guitar more.",Happy
653,Nokie started out playing a Fender Telecaster then switched to a Mosrite.  Fender is a prominent guitar maker.  I have not heard of Mosrite.  Have you?,Curious to dive deeper
653,No I have never heard of them either. I do own a Fender however.,Surprised
653," What I did not know is that Nokie played country with the likes of Buck Owens before starting the Ventures.  I wonder if ever played on Buck Owens TV show ""Hee Haw""?",Curious to dive deeper
653," I'm not sure, that show is a little bit before my time. I don't think I've ever seen it.",Curious to dive deeper
653,It is an old show...  You mentioned rock was your favorite genre.  What is your favorite rock album?,Curious to dive deeper
653," I have lately been listening to more greatest hits albums to listen to some classic acts. Right now I am listening to a lot of Queen, David Bowie, and the Dire Straits.",Happy
653," Mark Knopfler formerly with Dire Straits is my favorite living guitarist.  You should look up his solo works.  My favorite rock album is Pink Floyd ""The Wall"",  Did you know that their album ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" was still a best selling album as of 2014, more than 40 years later?",Curious to dive deeper
653,They are a band I would like to listen to more. I know a couple of their songs but they seem to have a diverse and interesting catalog.,Curious to dive deeper
653," Have you ever listened to WhiteSnake?  I like some of their music, but the band does not have much stability.  They have had more that 50 members, so its hard to know who played which song, unless you refer to their Wikipedia page!",Surprised
653," I have listened to a song or two of theirs, I did not know they had that many members. That is a lot of turnover!",Surprised
653," True, and with that much turnover, their music style drifts based on the style and personality of current members.  Do you still purchase albums or do you stream music, like Spotify?",Curious to dive deeper
653," I stream my music. I like the ability to be able to customize my playlists and separate songs how I would like them. It was fun talking music with you, have a great day!",Happy
653," I stream too, but I also purchase to load on my old iPod to use when cycling.  Streaming on my cell on a 50-100 mile bike ride might leave me stranded with a dead cell and no way to call for help should I need it!  Take care... ",Neutral
653," That's a good point, I don't bike that far so I think I should be okay. You take care as well.",Happy
654,Did you know Bruce Lee once won a Cha-Cha championship?,Neutral
654," No, is that true? that's pretty amazing but not completely surprising",Surprised
654," It is, he was really graceful as a martial artist, so I would believe it",Neutral
654," yes, that was my sentiment also, dancing can be much fun and relaxing as well as take one away from everyday troublesl",Happy
654,I never have been a great dancer.  But I do martial arts.,Neutral
654," oh, that's very interesting, I never tried it myself. Did you know Tupac was a ballet dancer in his high school years?",Curious to dive deeper
654,I think have heard something about him dabbling in dance.  So many people have such diverse talents that most dont realize.,Curious to dive deeper
654," yes, I had heard about it recently and was quite surprised by it. I like a bit of wordplay myself, but would not consider myself a poet.",Neutral
654," Ive never been with words, but I do like poetry, especially inventive ones.  Demetri Martin once wrote a 224 word palindrome poem.  Thats amazing.",Neutral
654," it sure is, people have used poetry for a long time, even in ancient times and all over the world.",Neutral
654,Even the Javanese alphabet when recited in order becomes a poem.,Curious to dive deeper
654," I can imagine that would make it a lot easier to remember, I wish some other things were in poetic form, that might make them easier to recall.",Happy
654," very true, people often dont get their pay for poems, Poe only got $9 for the Raven",Surprised
654," did you know that someone made a poem that is depressing when read normally, but becomes inspiring when read backwards? I wonder how much that person got paid.",Happy
654,Ive seen one like that before.  That takes a lot of planning and creativity.,Neutral
654," omg yes, William Shakespeare was quite a poet, and a successful one at that.",Neutral
654,He really has changed society.  Some of the phrases he coined are still around today like wild goose chase.,Curious to dive deeper
654," I know, and a lot of others too, makes me wonder, if they were in common use and he was the one that wrote them down, or actually invented them.",Neutral
654," Very true, maybe it was something people just said, there are plenty of phrases we use today that havent made their way into literature.",Neutral
654," and maybe some of them are better left out, but it would make for interesting material for future generations, maybe write it all down like Shakespeare and put it on stage.",Neutral
654," You never know, it could make you famous!",Neutral
654," hahaha yes, I doubt though as famous as good old Shakespeare, he even invented many names that are still popular to this day.",Happy
654,He was a legend.  Its been great chatting but I must get going.,Neutral
655,Good evening!,Happy
655,Hello. Do you use your computer often?,Neutral
655," During the week, yes - a lot.  On the weekend, not so much. Sometimes I feel like my entire life and mind are inside my computer...",Curious to dive deeper
655," It is truly amazing how many things we can do on the computer, despite it simply being a device to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations. Those 1s and 0s sure go a long way.",Neutral
655,Binary rules!  It is amazing and remarkable how far technology has come in the last few decades - leaps and bounds!  The space shuttle's GP computer ran off of 1MB of RAM....,Curious to dive deeper
655,I mean its amazing how computers can be made of anything from basic minecraft building blocks to running on water,Surprised
655," You mean computers that are powered by hydroelectricity?  When I fist read your message, I thought it said computers made out of water - which would be very strange!",Curious to dive deeper
655,Oh lol. I should have been more clear but yes that it runs on hydro power. Do you think we will one day be able to upload our minds into computers like transhumanists think?,Neutral
655," I think we will but not in the literal sense like in the Matrix - but to a large extent, we have already made storing the majority of our lives in the cloud",Curious to dive deeper
655,Wow that is an amazing way to think of things. What do you do online?,Surprised
655," For work I do a lot of research and confirmation of transactions, also look for data I can use to support my theories and valuations.  You?",Curious to dive deeper
655," Lol, I look at cat videos all day. Of course I do my share of work on my computer as well, but I also enjoy relaxing sometimes",Neutral
655," Yes!  The cats, the videos, the cat videos to pass the time away!  I sometimes get lost on Reddit looking at Memes and some of them also include cats...",Surprised
655," My favorite cat memes are the ones where they defy gravity and have no legs. Surprisingly despite dogs being man's best friend, there are more pet cats than dogs",Neutral
655," I would love to see the metrics on that stat about cats v. dogs - my main question revolves around the fact that if cats could talk, they would dispute being a pet and think that the human is their pet!",Surprised
655," Well thinking that way are we really the pets and our pets the master? After all, we provide them with shelter, luxurious food, and they pretty much don't even have to work for anything much less like us. Hmm going into some very dark territory.",Neutral
655," Luxurious food for sure - our dogs eat so well it's criminal!  But they do walk me, make me take them out to relive themselves, make me pick up after them....",Curious to dive deeper
655," Hmm maybe we are on to something? I see why cats were initially valued to control pests in some cultures and gods in others, but man they can laze about as much as they want. A cat that is 15 years old has spent 10 years sleeping! ",Surprised
655," That sleeping metric is something I can get behind!  If we were the pets, I suppose I would be sleeping a lot more!",Surprised
655," Did you know cats can even become elected officials? In talkeetna, alaska, a cat has been mayor since 1997",Neutral
655," Ha!  Now we're going back to who rules the roost - Although, the cat can't possibly be worst than a human politician in that position",Surprised
655," Indeed. In any case, I really enjoyed this chat. I hope we aren't taken out for discovering the conspiracy of pets being the true masters.",Neutral
656,Did you ever hear of Nokie Edwards of the Ventures?  He helped create hits in the 60's?,Surprised
656,I have not ever heard of him. What type of music did he/they play?,Curious to dive deeper
656,Looks like he did surf-rock standard,Surprised
656,Rock music is good.  Even though I've heard that termites will eat wood two times faster when listening to it!,Neutral
656," Who comes up with that fact?  Do you enjoy Van Halen?  He recorded the guitar solo for ""beat it!""",Surprised
656,I do like Van Halen and I didn't know that.  Did you know that Aerosmith made more money from the guitar hero game than from any album they did?,Neutral
656,I know that game is very popular.  Pink Floyd guitarist made a houseboat on the river thames into a recording studio.  I'd like to be on that boat,Surprised
656,That would be cool.  Guitars are wonderful inventions. The les paul gibson made in 1949 has never gone out of production!,Neutral
656,Queen's guitarist must have been brilliant with a phd in astrophysics.,Surprised
656,Seriously! that's impressive!  Brian May of Queen built his guitar himself from parts from an old fireplace.,Neutral
656," I guess he really is a genius and creative too.  Did you ever ""the dark side of the moon?""  It's been a best seller for 40 years.",Surprised
656,I can't remember if I have or not to be honest. Have you ever heard Legend by Bob Marley?  It's been on the charts for over 900 weeks!,Neutral
656,I don't know.  Maybe.  If you want to hear something interesting then you can listen to two 100 year old twin rappers from Japan.,Surprised
656," i bet that is interesting!  Say, did you know that Ohio is the only state with an official rock song?",Neutral
656,I didn't know that. Who created their rock song?,Surprised
656," I don't know but I do know the name is ""Hang on Sloopy.""",Neutral
656,Matt Bellamy holds the guinness record for most guitars smashed.  I would have rather seen them go to charity though.,Surprised
656,I would have too.  Rockers can be strange.  Led Zeppelin didn't put a title on their 4th album.  They just wanted to confuse the press.,Neutral
656,That would make it hard to find wouldn't it?   Do you know the band Linkin park?  They had the best selling album in the 21st century.,Surprised
656,I do know them and like them.  That is impressive! I had no idea it was that popular!,Neutral
656,Whitesnake gave some opportunities to people with over 50 members in their band throughout history.  Better odds for someone to be in their band.,Surprised
657," ""Reality show"" is a good description for Bezos's search for a new headquarters location. LOL.",Disgusted
657," The Amazon guy? Yeah, reality show sounds about right based on the jokes I read on Twitter!",Happy
657," I can't believe all those cities were competing to see who could give him the biggest corporate welfare deals, just so he could fill most of those ""new jobs"" with people brought in from outside -- and probably drive up rents more than enough to make up for any new revenue.",Disgusted
657," Oh yeah. The whole thing is a mess. It's the largest internet retailer in the world by revenue and market capitalization, so I guess I understand the desire for cities to want to get a piece of the action.",Neutral
657," Yeah, I live in Arkansas and see a lot of that approach of scheming to lure in outside business -- instead of encouraging the growth of more local business right here. It always costs more up-front in new taxes and infrastructure spending than we get in revenue.",Angry
657," Ah, Arkansas, home of Walmart, the prior most valuable retailer in the United States until surpassed by Amazon in 2015!",Surprised
657," Yeah, Walmart HQ is about 50 miles from where I live, and they basically own the local governments. They just let us live here.",Angry
657,I can see that. Walmart is the largest employer in the United States. That's quite a lot of power!,Surprised
657," Yeah, when I was a little kid there were only a handful of stores, all in NW Arkansas. I think the one in my hometown was the third one built.",Neutral
657," Well, Amazon is gunning for them in all aspects, that's for sure. Who would have guessed that a simple online bookstore would diversify so much. They sell and stream everything now!",Surprised
657," Yeah, and they own Whole Foods too.",Neutral
657," And since 1998 they've owned IMDB.com. They really have their hands in a lot of buckets, don't they?",Neutral
657,Yep. And unfortunately they're setting the pace for how labor is treated. The conditions in their warehouses will probably be copied in a lot of other service industries if somebody doesn't do something.,Disgusted
657,Yeah. I've heard Amazon workers walk between 7 and 15 miles each day as part of their daily shift!,Surprised
657," That's horrendous. I did a lot of walking as a hospital orderly, but it wasn't that much. They even wear diapers or pee in bottles because they can't get bathroom breaks.",Angry
657,That just makes me so angry! I have to pet my cat to calm down! Do you like cats?,Angry
657," I do! My mom fed a pregnant cat and encouraged a feral colony to grow up in her back yard, and I inherited responsibility for them and had to move them to where I live now when she died. But they're a lot of fun.",Happy
657," Cats are the second most popular bet in the US, after freshwater fish. I would have just assumed cats were first! Everyone loves cats, right?",Neutral
657," There are people who say they don't like them, or who prefer dogs, but it's hard for me to understand.",Neutral
657," In Japan and Taiwan they even have cat cafes, where people pay hourly to have drinks and play with cats! ",Surprised
657,Sounds kind of like a dog park. I bet it would be fun. Nice chatting!,Happy
657,I'll have to plan a trip to Japan to check one out! Good bye!,Neutral
657,Bye!,Happy
658,Hi do you shop online much?,Curious to dive deeper
658," I do actually I do a lot of shopping on Amazon, and you?",Curious to dive deeper
658,Me too. Do you ever use AmazonBasics products?,Curious to dive deeper
658,I do and I find they to be of good quality despite the fact they are not believed to be so,Curious to dive deeper
658,Yeah I think so too. Did you know Jeff built a clock in a mountain?,Curious to dive deeper
658,Yeah heard about that and it is supposed to run for 10 000 years,Curious to dive deeper
658,Yeah wonder what that is about Did you know Amazon own IMDB?,Curious to dive deeper
658,Yeah they have owned it since 1998. They are everywhere it seems,Curious to dive deeper
658,Yeah. And they now deliver on Sundays because of a contract with USPS,Curious to dive deeper
658,That is convenient for sure. Their workers seem to work up to 15 miles a day,Curious to dive deeper
658,That makes sense since they are so busy all the time but that is a lot of steps,Curious to dive deeper
658,Yeah for sure. Do you know who their first customer was?,Curious to dive deeper
658,Yeah it was this guy who spent less than $30 and got a building named after him.,Curious to dive deeper
658,Yeah that is awesome. do you use your computer much?,Curious to dive deeper
658,I do all the time actually. Mine runs on a bigger ram than the space shuttle one,Curious to dive deeper
658," Haha true story, 1 mb of ram is nothing nowadays. Russians once made a computer that ran on water",Curious to dive deeper
658,That us pretty amazing. Do you have an Apple of a PC?,Curious to dive deeper
658,I have an Apple and I hear that you are not allowed to smoke near that as it voids the warranty. Glad I do not smoke,Curious to dive deeper
658,Yeah good for you. Transhumanists are trying to upload their minds to the computer,Curious to dive deeper
658,Wow I wonder if they will manage to do that eventually. Do you like animals?,Curious to dive deeper
658," I do, I have a dog and two cats. And you?",Happy
659,William Shakespeare was a master writer; I would argue that the world will never see another like him.,Happy
659," I agree with you.  I heard he might have actually been a woman, or,  a group of people.  Did you know he is credited with inventing the names Miranda, Jessica and Olivia?",Curious to dive deeper
659,Yeah I actually did know that. He was a very interesting character. He kept his life very private.,Neutral
659,Are you a fan of artistic dance like ballet as well as Shakespeare?,Curious to dive deeper
659," I am not really a fan of artistic dance. However, did you know that Tupac danced ballet in highschool? Dance is such a undiscovered art.",Curious to dive deeper
659," No, I didn't know that about Tupac but I know football players talk ballet to learn to be more flexible and nimble.",Curious to dive deeper
659," Huh, that is pretty interesting. I have never heard that about footballers before. Michael Jackson even had a patent on a device that helped him lean that one time.  ",Neutral
659,How about poetry?  Are you a poetry lover since you like Shakespeare?,Curious to dive deeper
659," Not really a poetry fan, but I do appreciate Shakespeare's work. Poetry is an interesting work of art though, so much effort and thought is needed to create such a small amount of work.",Neutral
659,I read there is a poem which if read normally is depressing but when read backwards is inspiring.  I'd love to know the title or who wrote it.  Do you know?,Curious to dive deeper
659," I have heard about this poem before, but I could not tell you the name of said poem.",Neutral
659," I don't think most poets make a living at it even today.  Edgar Allen Poe got $9 for The Raven, which is probably like, what, $500 today?",Curious to dive deeper
659,Yeah I believe so. Poets back in the day where starving artists.,Sad
659,I think they still are starving for the most part!  Did you know the Javanese alphabet when recited in order forms a poem?,Curious to dive deeper
659," Why yes I did! Poetry dates back such a long time. It started in Africa by the Nile, Niger and Volta river valley. ",Happy
659,I didn't know that!  Do you think rap is our modern poetry?,Curious to dive deeper
659," Wow, I did not know that. That does sound about right though. Did you know that ancient Grecians concentrated on the features of poetry such as repetition and uses of speech. ",Neutral
659," Yes, they tried to distinguish it from more objectively informative and  prosaic forms of writing.",Curious to dive deeper
659," Yeah, exactly. I would argue that ancient people were much more driven and intellectual than modern civilization.  ",Neutral
659,They had less distractions and fewer forms of entertainment.  The Epic of Gilgamesh was written in Sumerian and is the earliest Western Asian poetry.,Curious to dive deeper
659," Yeah. Epics are interesting forms of work. So much writing for such limited meaning. But, its all about how much you love your work.",Curious to dive deeper
659," Or, how much you have to say!  Great chatting with you.",Curious to dive deeper
660,Hi. Do you like Shakespeare?,Curious to dive deeper
660,Hello!  Yes I do.  He is regarded as the greatest writer in the English language.  Are you a fan?,Happy
660,I find him to be like poetry...it takes a while to get. I saw Macbeth at the Folger Theatre and enjoyed it.,Happy
660," How neat!  He coined a lot of popular phrases we still use today such as ""good riddance"" ""laughing stock"" etc.",Happy
660," Really? I hear he invented the name Miranda. Who knew he influenced ""Sex and the City"".",Happy
660,Wow.  I didn't know that!  Did you know that he was alive at the same time as Pocahontas?,Curious to dive deeper
660,Wow. Too bad they didn't meet. I'd like to see Pocahontas play Lady MacBeth...though I don't think they allowed women onstage back then.,Happy
660,I'm not sure.  Ironically both of them died only a year apart!  Do you like dancing?,Happy
660,I like slow dancing with my gf. I can't do Michael Jackson-like extreme moves.,Happy
660,lol Me neither.  Did you know that he had a patent on a device that he used to get those extreme leans in some of his moves?,Happy
660," He was good with $$, not unlike Tupac...who did ballet.",Happy
660,I didn't know he did ballet.  Bruce Lee was a great dancer and won a Hong Kong cha-cha championship in 1958!,Happy
660," Apparently, dancer can kick some ass. Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. ",Happy
660,lol  Profesional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.  I wonder if Tupac wore those?  lol,Happy
660,Probably. He was mouse king in the Nutcracker. He could break some balls,Happy
660," LOL  On a different subject, did you know that Edgar Allan Poe only received $9 for the publication of his poem ""The Raven""?  ",Happy
660,Wow. He should've moondanced instead. Or at least write a poem going backwards.,Happy
660,haha  There is a poem that if you read in normally is depressing but if you read it backwards it's inspiring!  That had to be tought to write.,Happy
660,Sounds like something the Beatles would do. Michael Jackson owns those rights too.,Happy
660,Yes he was smart to buy those rights!  Have you ever heard of the Javanese alphabet?  I've never heard of it.  When recited in order it forms a poem.,Happy
660,I'm going to check it out now. Take care!,Happy
661," Hi, have you listened to any good albums lately?",Neutral
661,I have to say that I have not unfortunately.  I haven't even listened to anything on vinyl.  Have you?,Neutral
661,I really love the new James Blake album. And last year's Janelle Monae's album was so fun. What do you like to listen to?,Curious to dive deeper
661,I'm more old school. I like music from the 1980s and some jazz from the 1940's and 50's.  I'd love to listen to some music that was recorded  and made into bound books before 1948.,Neutral
661,That really is old school! Do you have any recommendations?,Curious to dive deeper
661,I don't have any from the 40's and 50's but I would say Duran Duran if you like pop and Alabama if you like country.  If you like rock music then Bon Jovi and Def Leppard.  I do listen to a little Linkin Park. I was surprised to learn that their album was the best selling of this century.,Neutral
661," I was surprised at that too, but I remember buying the album when it came out. They were kind of the first band to cross rock and hip-hop/rap, in my opinion. I remember that collaboration with Jay-Z was pretty novel at the time",Neutral
661," I only know a few of their songs. I think they did one for the Transformer's movie that was really good.  Say, did you know that states can have official rock songs?  Oklahoma has one.",Neutral
661," I had no idea states had official rock songs, but ""Do You Realize"" is great. The lead singer is great with the guitar. Do you know how to play the guitar or any instruments?",Surprised
661,No I don't but I wish i did. I would love to play the piano. Do you play any?,Neutral
661," I played the flute and am taking piano lessons now. I've tried to play the guitar, but it was hard for me. ",Neutral
661,I tried to but I have to admit that it hurt my fingers just way to much!  Have you ever listened to Whitesnake?  I like a few of their songs and had no idea until recently that they had had over 50 different band members throughout the years.,Neutral
661,I'm only familiar with the popular songs they released. 50 members is a lot! Did you know that a Hanson song became a most requested track on a Chicago alt-rock radio station because djs didn't reveal the band?,Neutral
661,I did not know that!  I'm not sure what to say to that to be honest. I guess the song was really good if it got played on the radio station.,Neutral
661," It makes me think about how bands can transcend different genres of music. I feel rock music has that ability, mainly because of the guitar. It fits so well in different genres",Neutral
661,They mostly use an electric guitar so it can be used different ways.  What's interesting to me is that originally rock music drew heavily on the blues and even country music.,Neutral
661,That is interesting. It's surprising to hear rock's 50s and 60s influence still today. The Beatles are still influential in most rock bands today,Neutral
661," Yeah they are.  To me, good music never goes out of style.  I do like though that rock music is becoming more diverse and not just having a standard pattern.",Neutral
661," I agree. Even within pop music, rock music has an influence. Lady Gaga's Born This Way album was way less pop and more rock. It was kind of surprising, but she's always had a rock influence underneath.",Neutral
661," I like that album.  In a way, rock musicians have always been more "":real"" and down to earth than pop stars.  I mean, take russia's biggest rock star. He kept his job in a boiler room while being a superstar.  ",Neutral
661," Despite the fame, he kept it humble. That's a true rock star.",Neutral
661,It really is.  I was surprised to learn that Russia had rock stars to be honest though.,Neutral
662,Good morning to you. Do you like rock music?It sure was popular in the 1950s when it first began.,Curious to dive deeper
662," I do like rock music! Have you heard about the rocker, viktor tsoi?",Curious to dive deeper
662,Yes apparently he kept his job in the boiler room of his apartment even after becoming the biggest rockstar in Russian history. What a humble guy.,Happy
662,I know! I really enjoy stories about famous perfromers remaining humble and to their roots.,Happy
662,Yes very cool. Did you know the state rock song of Oklahoma is do you realize by the flaming lips? I didn't even know states had rock songs.,Surprised
662,I never knew states had rock songs either! I wonder if every state has one?,Surprised
662,Good question I'm not sure. Sonic the hedgehog was originally supposed to be a member of a rock band and have a blond haired human girlfriend named Madonna.,Surprised
662,I used to play the sonic video games and I never knew that!,Surprised
662,Yes I loved that game. Do you listen to albums much anymore? Lincoln Park's hybrid theory album is the best selling album of the 21st Century.,Curious to dive deeper
662,I am shocked that they have the best selling album.,Surprised
662,Yes me too. I think it is also shocking that the dark side of the Moon is one of the best selling albums of 2014.,Surprised
662,And it was released over 40 years ago!,Surprised
662,Yes that is incredible. Another funny stat is that two identical twins from Japan released a rap album when they turned 100 years old in 1992.,Surprised
662,I would love to see that!,Happy
662,Me too! The first album to reach platinum status without the support of airplay or major tour was NWA's straight out of Compton.,Surprised
662,I wonder why they did not have support?,Curious to dive deeper
662,Maybe he wanted to prove a point. Or maybe rappers didn't get much respect. I betThe album came out on audio cassette!,Curious to dive deeper
662,Do you like reel big fish?,Curious to dive deeper
662,Yes they're pretty good. They rerecorded all their hits from best of album after losing their rights to their old record label...that's kind of funny. Well it was great chatting with you today.,Surprised
662,I wonder why they lost their rights. It was nice talking to you too.,Neutral
662,Probably something in the fine print. Have a good one!,Neutral
663," HI, have you read Macbeth? I read it and is very interesting",Curious to dive deeper
663," I have! Lady Macbeth was always my favorite character but now I'm leaning towards Lady Macduff. A revival of the play about ~350 years ago gave her a bigger role and she's actually heroic, not murderous lol",Happy
663," hahaha, well, it surprises me that is so updated. French dances, women, shortened monologues, I am curious to go to see it!",Curious to dive deeper
663," Updated for the time period, you mean. King Charles II was raised in the French court and fell in love with Catholicism and all things French, so it made sense at the time to add these things to an English production",Neutral
663," Yes, I was thinking that you could enjoy the dialogue between Lady Macbeth and Lady Mcduff, would you like to be chatting with them?",Happy
663," Not really! One ordered the murder of the other's children, if I remember correctly",Fearful
663," hahahahaha, you remember perfectly! I would have liked to see the witches singing  ""It's bonny, happy, chirpy, fun!""",Disgusted
663," That would be cool. It'd make a fun addition to ""double, double, toil and trouble,"" though I wonder if that was cut for speed? I sure hope not",Neutral
663,I hope not. I would be afraid to be in the Psychiatric Hospital Bedlam with real inmates acting the show. I know it is stupid. All of us are a little crazy. I think it is more like a lack of a certain substance in our brain that makes us crazy.,Curious to dive deeper
663,Have you read other Shakespearian works? I read a bunch in high school and college and didn't even get past the tip of the iceberg (39 plays!),Curious to dive deeper
663," Yes, I did. I am afraid to tell you, some of them have so many rolls, that I can't remembered all of them well. He was so huge mentally, to be able to make ensnaring with the acts and remember all the personages.",Curious to dive deeper
663," I know what you mean about ""huge mentally."" He actually made intentional grammatical errors to redirect the audience's attention. I feel that that was pretty ahead of his time",Neutral
663," He used to play with the words. I read that he was the one that created the phrase good bye. But in reality, he coined it as God by you, and with the time it shortened. Very interesting.",Curious to dive deeper
663," The thing is, some phrases are attributed to him but I think that he may have been the first prominent person to document certain phrases rather than invent them",Curious to dive deeper
663,Could be. What it means for you the phrase Good Riddance?,Curious to dive deeper
663,It means it is good to be rid of someone or something.,Neutral
663,Thank you. I think the girl in The Tempest was named Miranda. Did you read that Tchaikovsky donated his skull to make it pass for the skull of Yorick?.,Curious to dive deeper
663," No way! I wonder why that was necessary? Was he a big fan of Shakespeare, then?",Curious to dive deeper
663," Yes, I guess, he was himself a genius in the music. It was so nice to chat with you, I am giving you an excellent.",Surprised
663,Thank you! I love meeting a fellow fan of the Bard upon Avon :),Happy
663,Me too! you are very literate!,Curious to dive deeper
663," Maybe next time we meet, we can talk about the rest of the Bard's plays!",Happy
663,Yes!,Happy
663," Maybe also we can discuss some of the Greek epics, like Odysseus. I studied Classics on college and love Greek poetry!",Happy
664,Good morning. Have you watched the Ethiopian celebrity chef? He's awesome.,Happy
664,I have. The way he is trying to combat hunger in his country is just awe inspiring.,Neutral
664," It truly is. His Youtube channel is ""Grandpa Kitchen"". I think they should have him on Sesame Street, like Carol Burnett.",Neutral
664,Im sad I missed that episode. She was a very funny lady. Lol. Did you now that Judge Judy makes 123000 per episode.,Neutral
664," Yes she was. I saw that. It's crazy. Then again, so is the money LeBron makes.",Neutral
664,I bet both she and lebron have got to go to pixars secret room. I just wonder what they keep in there.,Happy
664," I would love to visit that room. I wonder if Robin Williams ever did, aside from Aladdin, he did some work for Pixar as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
664," With aladdin, Robin williams began the trend of celebrities voicing characters in animated films. He was a great man. I just love the work he did on the genie in aladdin.",Happy
664," I didn't care for it. I would have loved to have been Cristiano Renaldo's agent, he bought him an island for his wedding.",Neutral
664,Wouldnt that be a crazy gift to recieve. He was also expelled from school for throwing a chair at a teacher.,Neutral
664," I think it's awesome that he won't get a tattoo, because he couldn't give blood. Thats impressive.",Surprised
664," That is a pretty good thing to do. Did you know that he is named after Ronald Reagan, his fathers favorite actor. Lol.",Neutral
664," I did not. I did know about the little boy whose education he paid for, he was a tsunami survivor.",Neutral
664,Soccer makes more than football basketball baseball golf tennis and hockey does combined. I think it is a lot more popular in other parts of the world than in the US.,Neutral
664," I have never watched a pro game, and was surprised to learn that we call it ""soccer""' when it is really football.",Neutral
664,Well Im sure you know who jon stewart is from the daily show. He represented the US at the pan american maccabi games in brazil all the way back in 1983.,Neutral
664,I do not know who he is. Did they play with three teams on the field at the same time?,Curious to dive deeper
664,I think most games are played with only two teams. Although there is a variation of the games that utilizes three teams in one game.,Happy
664,I still find it hard to believe that it is the world's most popular sport.,Neutral
664," Yeah me too a little bit, until you take into account that it is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries around the world. Then it makes sense.",Neutral
664," That's insane. I have to get to work, thanks for chatting with me. have a wonderful day.",Neutral
665," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
665," hey I'm good, how are you do you like soccer at all?",Curious to dive deeper
665,I do like soccer. Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
665," well I personally don't haha, but I do know that a soccer team scored on themselves one time, they did it on purpose because it would help them advance in a cup match!",Curious to dive deeper
665,Makes sense... I can see them being too high in the next round and scoring to play a weaker team.,Neutral
665," yes that's what I'm thinking happened, also I didn't know that the super bowl is smaller than the third biggest event in soccer!",Surprised
665," Yeah. It's the world's game. The money is more than all 4 major sports in the us, combined!",Surprised
665,that is crazy! what is weird is that greenland can't join FIFA because there isn't enough grass there for a soccer field!,Surprised
665," That seems like it is limiting. What about turf. Why can't they play on turf, FIFA?",Curious to dive deeper
665,ya I wonder if they require natural grass? I don't watch sports so I have no idea about the rules of soccer,Curious to dive deeper
665," So if you don't watch sports, what do you do in your free time. I watch sports, all the time...",Curious to dive deeper
665," haha well I work and I also play piano and have other hobbies. I don't know. I don't miss sports. I know all my friends watch them, and I'll watch it if we're together, but I don't follow any teams or players or anything.",Curious to dive deeper
665,You play the piano? How long have you played?,Curious to dive deeper
665," I've been playing for about 4 years now, I used to play video games but realized that the time you waste with those you never get back, so I started learning piano and I'd say I'm pretty good at this point, do you play any instruments?",Curious to dive deeper
665,I used to play trumpet and did like it. I just ran out of time. I want to get my son into music. He wants to play the guitar so I am going to go that route...,Happy
665," ya it's definitely worth learning an instrument, the longer you play the better you will be so it would pay to have your son start early!",Happy
665,I just want to give him an outlet for his anger. He is 7 and likes sports but I want him to have another outlet for stress. Do you play for stress release?,Happy
665," well I would say I play it because it's fun, personally. haha, I guess since its fun it's kind of like stress release, I am relieved to know that Paris Hilton holds the world record for most overrated celebrity",Happy
665,There's a lot of people trying to take that crown though...,Sad
665," ya, reminds me of Justin Bieber, how do you feel about him?",Curious to dive deeper
665,Very underwhelmed... Nice chatting with you!,Happy
666," Hello there, are you a fan of movies?",Curious to dive deeper
666," Hello, I love movies. What about you?",Curious to dive deeper
666," Yeah I sure do, did you ever watch Stanley Kubrick movies?",Curious to dive deeper
666,I've seen bits and pieces but never a full one. He seems to be quite the talented cinematographer though!,Neutral
666," Oh yeah he sure was, and Roger Deakins, did you ever hear about him?",Curious to dive deeper
666,He is the guy who has been nominated a ton of times but never won right? Talk about always a bridesmaid never a bride.,Neutral
666," Yeah good call, I guess 13 times and never won!",Curious to dive deeper
666,That makes almost make me want to quit doing my job if that happened. But I suppose there is so much competition for the awards that you just keep trying.,Sad
666,That is very true.  Did you know that no women has ever been nominated for best cinematography?,Curious to dive deeper
666,That seems crazy to me. You would think that after all this time that at least one woman would have at least been nominated. But with people like stanley kubrik and Gavin Free it is hard to break in.,Sad
666," Yeah I would think so as well, but I wonder how many female cinematographers there are?",Curious to dive deeper
666,There has to be a minimal amount to justify never receiving a nomination. I would love to do the slow motion work for something. It would be a lot of fun.,Curious to dive deeper
666," Yeah that would be really cool, like doing some of the matrix scenes or something like that. ",Curious to dive deeper
666,Yes! It seems so sexist in the industry though that women are relegated to wardrobe like the main concern of their life is clothes.,Angry
666," It really is, men and women should be getting the same pay, have same jobs, everything.  That old stuff is just that, old. ",Curious to dive deeper
666," Exactly! I wonder how many of the facts we know about so much, like the sun or physics,  are because of women but they didn't get the credit. ",Angry
666," Exactly, I'm sure there are quite a few, think of all of the wives of inventors and other people I'm sure they did some of the inventing!",Curious to dive deeper
666,I do love that some of those inventors give their wives credit for their assistance. They acknowlege they wouldn't have made those discoveries without them.,Neutral
666," Yeah and they should, like when they discovered the sun is actually white, not yellow because of atmospheric effect. ",Curious to dive deeper
666," Or that it produces enough energy to power everything for 500,000 years in one second. Talk about an advertisement for alternative energy. ",Neutral
666," Yeah good call.  Well it's been nice talking with you, I hope you have a good night!",Happy
667," Hello, did you know that the sun is only 1,000,000,000th the size of the biggest star?",Surprised
667," Hi, how are you? That's amazing! The sun accounts for most of the mass in our solar system, yet it's not that big.",Neutral
667," I am doing good. Well, the sun is an obvious eye on Earth. ",Neutral
667,And most of us think that the eye is yellow. Actually it's white. The atmosphere makes the sun look yellow.,Neutral
667," I feel that I am looking at an optical illusion. I thought the sun was hotter, but a lightening bolt is way hotter.",Neutral
667,I think that's only compared to the surface of the sun. The interior is pretty hot. It would be great if we could capture more energy from the sun.,Neutral
667," Well the interior is where the core of the sun is, therefore it will be hot. Isn't the core of Earth the hotter area? The sun could save up the bill.",Curious to dive deeper
667," The sun produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500 000 years. Of course, we'd have to build a giant sphere around the sun to capture all of the energy coming from it.",Neutral
667,That is why we have solar panels.,Curious to dive deeper
667," If we could put giant solar panels in space, we could capture a ton of energy! That would be great! Are you interested in cinematography?",Curious to dive deeper
667," It definitely will save us a lot of money. Not a big fan I know of it. However, it seems sexist to not have a nominated female.",Curious to dive deeper
667,I'm not surprised. Hollywood doesn't have enough female directors or cinematographers. Things need to change. One guy has been nominated 13 times and never won!,Surprised
667,That is sad. Do you know who that person may be?,Curious to dive deeper
667," Roger Deakins. I guess he is well known, but probably hasn't played the political game well. Have you heard of James Wong?",Curious to dive deeper
667,I have not heard of James Wong. What was he known for?,Curious to dive deeper
667," James Wong Howe was an oscar-winning cinematographer who pioneered the use of wide-angle lenses, low-key lighting, crab dolly and deep-focus cinematography.",Neutral
667," Wow, that is a lot of knowledge for the future of cinematography.",Surprised
667," He was married to a white woman, but the marriage was not legal until 1948!",Neutral
667," Interesting, where was marriage not legal?",Curious to dive deeper
667," I think in certain states, I don't know which ones. He was an American citizen by 1943, so it was entirely racism that made his marriage illegal.",Neutral
667," Well, good thing we are in the year of 2019. It was nice chatting with you.",Neutral
668," The sun is a pretty crazy thing, what do you think?",Curious to dive deeper
668,It really is. Did you know that the sun is actually white. It just looks yellow because of atmospheric scattering.,Happy
668," wow, I never knew that. I am so amazed about the sun, do you got any other interesting facts?",Curious to dive deeper
668,Actually I do. A lightning bolt is actually 5x hotter than the surface of the sun. What do you think about that?,Neutral
668,I think that is insane and never need to feel the heat of any of them lol.,Curious to dive deeper
668,Scientists have shown that the sun creates enough energy in one second to meet our demands for 500000 years.,Neutral
668," wow, I wonder if there is anything that is able to catch all that energy and store it, do you think we have it?",Curious to dive deeper
668," I know solar needs a lot of work to be effecient enough, but it is on the right trackin my opinion.",Curious to dive deeper
668," That is a good point. I know a fact about Neptune, they have just completed their first full orbit of the sun since 1846!",Curious to dive deeper
668,Thats cool to know. Did you also know that the sun is about 109 times the diameter of earth.,Neutral
668," Wow that is so much! I know the sun is 1 billionth times smaller than the biggest star in the galaxy, makes me feel really small!",Curious to dive deeper
668,That is true. So what kind of clothing do you like.,Neutral
668," I like nike and all the sporty type, but also i like polos to look clean, you?",Curious to dive deeper
668,I like to wear clothes like the pilgrims wore. Lol. They actually wore clothes that were full of color. Black was only or special occasions.,Neutral
668," lol, I never knew that. They never taught that side of the pilgrims in school!",Curious to dive deeper
668,No they di not. Lol. I heard about a tore in alabama that only sells clothing and electronics that was left at baggage claim at the airport.,Happy
668," wow, I need to get on over to Ohare and start a business from that. That is like pure profit!",Curious to dive deeper
668,Were you aware that apple had a clothing line in 1986. Wonder why they stopped it?,Neutral
668," I never knew that. I would be rocking that right now! All the apple fans too would be into it also, they should bring it back! It was so nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
668,Yeah I just want one of those shirts with the apple logo on it. Yep nicechat. Have a good one.,Happy
668,Thanks! Enjoy your weekend!,Curious to dive deeper
669," Hi, do you like soccer?",Happy
669," I do enjoy soccer, have done all my life but I don't get to see much now.",Neutral
669,Are you an American soccer fan or european?,Curious to dive deeper
669," I'm originally from England so stay in touch with the soccer that is played there, and also in Europe.",Neutral
669,Nice. I find English soccer so much more interesting that the professional soccer here. Who's your team?,Curious to dive deeper
669," I always support a team called Everton, not too many have heard of them.  My local team were successful in the nineties but faded away, Wimbledon.",Sad
669,I know Everton. They are on every once in a while. I usually watch them on NBC Sports while I clean or do chores around the house.,Happy
669,They are the team that produced Wayne Rooney before he was purchase by Manchester united for a lot of money.  He plays for DC United here now.,Happy
669,I just know Rooney from his hair plugs! He is a really talented player!,Happy
669," He was a team mate of that Christano Ronaldo, I hear he's in trouble with the police now.",Sad
669,Ronaldo? For what? I know there was a tax thing and a sexual assualt but is there more now?,Curious to dive deeper
669," Yes there was the tax thing, many players get hit with that one.  The one I was thinking of is the sexual assault in Las Vegas.  Not sure how he'll fight that one in the long term.",Curious to dive deeper
669,Me either. I have a feeling that it will involve a large settlement.,Happy
669," I guess he's done that already, he paid $375,000 for a legal settlement, but a German newspaper found out and made it public.",Sad
669," I did not know that. So he's not in legal trouble, just media trouble.",Curious to dive deeper
669,Apparently the woman in question has now approached the Las Vegas police and they have opened an investigation.  Not sure how it works if he is in Italy and they are here.,Sad
669,I am surprised Nike has not dropped him though.,Surprised
669," Not yet, expressed concern but so far are sticking with him.  I suppose he is innocent until proven guilty.  The MeToo movement is moving through just about every industry.",Neutral
669,yeah. I feel bad for the way women have been treated. I am sure there are a lot of skeletons still in closets.,Sad
669," If people have acted criminally then they should face the consequences.  I have a young daughter and hope she will be safe when she is an adult, I'm all for MeToo.",Fearful
669,MeToo!!!! Mine is 5 and I would move some furniture if something happened to her. Nice chatting with you?,Happy
669," Not the best subject to end on, but hopefully the long run will see benefits.  Good bye.",Happy
670," Hi, how are you?",Neutral
670," Hello there, I am well thank you.  How are you today?",Curious to dive deeper
670,I'm great! Are you a fan of sports?,Curious to dive deeper
670," I am I like pretty much most sports, and I always cheer for all my local teams. ",Curious to dive deeper
670,Are you into wrestling? It's a sport that I really don't know well.,Neutral
670," No not really, but I do respect it quite a bit.  How about you, are you a fan?",Curious to dive deeper
670," Not really a fan. I think it's cool that Lincoln is in the wrestling hall of fame. Lost only once in approximately 300 matches. I wonder how Trump would do, with his bone spurs and such.",Curious to dive deeper
670," Really? I would never have thought that, what a cool fact.  Yeah I doubt Trump could beat anyone. ",Curious to dive deeper
670,Plato was a professional wrestler before he became a philosopher. Maybe sports excellence and thinking go together. Are you into baskeball?,Neutral
670," Yeah especially wrestling I guess.  Yeah I really like basketball, my favorite team is leading the league so far this year.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
670," I like the pro game but I feel that the game has distorted college. In 39 out of 50 states, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach. Something seems askew.",Curious to dive deeper
670," Yeah that doesn't make much sense to me, I think the pay for pro athletes is way too high as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
670," At the pro level, I don't care. They make money, but the owners make more. I would rather see money going to make college less expensive, especially since it's getting exhorbitant. ",Neutral
670," Yes, I can totally agree with that, they could use that extra money and put it back into lower tuition. ",Curious to dive deeper
670,Universities are  supposed to deal with knowledge: teaching and research. Not provide entertainment.Kareem's  use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball. I wonder how fans now would react to that.,Neutral
670," I never knew that, very interesting.  Do you know who the inventor of basketball was?",Curious to dive deeper
670,Canadian guy named Naismith. Wanted a sport for his players to do in the off-season.,Neutral
670,Yeah good call it was James Naismith.  I wonder what he would think of the game today.,Curious to dive deeper
670,It's evolved. The inside game with big men is over. Now the 3pointer has changed the balance. No need to be tall if you can shoot well.,Neutral
670,Yeah well now you have to be tall and still able to shoot the three.  It is interesting how the game evolves over time.,Curious to dive deeper
670," Well, Ive enjoyed chatting with you about basketball!",Happy
670," Yeah same here, it was nice talking with you, I hope you have a good night. ",Happy
671," Morning! Wow, I haven't thought about sports since high school. I didn't realize competitive wrestling really is.",Curious to dive deeper
671," Apparently its as competitive as other sports, I just to wrestle in high school so it would be nice to remember those times.",Curious to dive deeper
671," Oh did ya?  I was never very sporty in high school, but I had a friend who wrestled and I remember how he was always so concerned with his weight and trying to make sure he kept in the right weight class. Seemed a very strict kind of sport, like you need to be very diligent to participate.",Curious to dive deeper
671," Yeah I can see why, you have to mantain a certain weight, have you seen Marvin Joseph? he is a grea wrestler, one of the best I have ever seen.",Curious to dive deeper
671," I haven't heard of Marvin Joseph as a wrestler - I'm sorry to say the extent of my knowledge about wrestling is pretty much limited to The Rock. But I just learned that even Plato was a pro wrestler before he became a philosopher. Do you think it's the kind of thing you can pick up again, like riding a bike? ",Curious to dive deeper
671," Sorry I mean River Curtis, I got confused with the reporter from the Washington Post, Curtis won the Wrestler of the year award, and I think it is, it might be harder than riding a bike again but the body has memory and with hard work its possible",Curious to dive deeper
671," Do you think if you had kids you would encourage them to try out wrestling? I can't tell if it's something that would be great for teaching determination and self-control, or if it could lead to eating disorders and the like. If you could do it all again, would you still have wrestled?",Curious to dive deeper
671," I think I would, I just to like it and maybe my kids would too, I would want them to play sports thats for sure, you know Lincoln was a wresler, he is on the hall of hame even",Surprised
671," It's so weird to think of these serious people once being wrestlers. I mean, you have them on the one side, and the other end where folks in Turkey are dousing themselves in oil to wrestle - that oil wrestling sounds more like a spectacle than a serious sport but I guess to each his own, lol.",Curious to dive deeper
671," I agree, it was suprising to me to learn that Lincoln was a wresler and a good one as well, you know who Denis Cyplenkov is?",Curious to dive deeper
671," Yes! I heard he has the biggest and most muscled hands in the world. Mind-boggling, I wonder what he looks like. I'd be kind of interested to watch a wrestling match. Do you prefer something more like competitive wrestling, or something more like the wrestling  you see on TV?",Curious to dive deeper
671," Yeah not only a champion but a bodybuilder as weell and I prefer competitive wresling better, what about you? any preferences?",Curious to dive deeper
671," I feel like if I was going to watch it, I'd prefer competitive - it seems more real and less like a show. Not that there's anything wrong with a show, but I think I'd rather see the competition than the show. I think it would be cool to watch that Wrestler of the Year, Curtis, in action.",Neutral
671," It would be interesting indeed, do you like any other sports? Im a basketball fan as well.",Curious to dive deeper
671," Well to be honest, I'd definitely watch basketball over wrestling. I love the fast pace. And I just learned that there's even a basketball court on the top floor of the Supreme Court building. How cool is that!?",Surprised
671," Yeah me too, I like basketball better, and really? I didnt know that, it must be a really cool court, I wonder if they host tournaments in there",Curious to dive deeper
671," I hope they do - if not, seriously, why do they even have it? Maybe the Justices take their recesses up there and Ruth Bader Ginsberg can actually dunk the ball! Haha! It's great exercise. Do you play at all?",Curious to dive deeper
671," I used to play it but not anymore, now I just watch it lol, there is a team called Tall Blacks in New Zealand, that sounds racial.",Curious to dive deeper
671," It really does, doesn't it? I wonder if it's just a cultural difference and maybe they don't feel that way in New Zealand. You know if you said that in the U.S. you'd go viral for all the wrong reasons! I guess the New Zealand team must just be extremely tall, eh? I had no idea the dunk shot got banned from college basketball for a while, did you know that?",Curious to dive deeper
671," Yeah, you could get in a lot of trouble for naming a team like that, and I didnt know that either, I wonder why they decided to ban the dunk shot lol, its one of the best moves in basketball.",Curious to dive deeper
671," Definitely super dramatic, a good crowd pleaser, lol. I'm going sign off after this, great chatting with you!!",Happy
671," Its been great chatting with you as well, I will go and watch some basketball videos in YouTube now.",Happy
672," I have a love/hate relationship with running, but I can appreciate people who can do it and do it well like Donald Ritchie",Neutral
672," Same here, I have run one marathon and never plan to again, I couldnt imagine being an ultra runner",Surprised
672,I'm surprised that someone who runs so much died at 73. I would have thought he would have lived longer from being healthy,Curious to dive deeper
672," I dont think they every released an official cause of death, but yes, somone who could run 3 marathons a day for 10 days straight certainly must have been in tip top shape.",Surprised
672,Maybe all the running was hard on his heart. He's from Scotland and never ran a race in his kilt. I'm not sure if those are very aerodynamic,Neutral
672," They do seem like theyd be very heavy, especially to keep up that 7 minute per mile pace - even when he was running 100 miles.  I cant even do that for one mile.",Curious to dive deeper
672," I guess that's how he got the name ""ultrarunner."" It's kinda gross, but one of his secrets was urinating while running rather than stopping at the portable toilets",Disgusted
672," That was one part of running I could never do, I didnt want the urine soaked shoes.  Plus it just sounds gross.",Disgusted
672," That's a convincing enough reason for me to never pursue running at that level. I wonder how many pairs of shoes he would go through compared to ballet dancers. At the professional level, they may have to use four pairs in only a week",Curious to dive deeper
672," That is hard to believe, I wonder why they havent made them hold up better for the dancers.  That would be pretty expensive.",Neutral
672," Maybe the problem is that shoes in modern times aren't the same quality they used to be. I've heard that shoes from 5,000 years ago actually perform better than what you buy at the store now",Surprised
672,That is surprising seeing as some shoes now that are considered to have complex construction and made with expensive material can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars.,Surprised
672," Then again, some of those are high fashion shoes that sell for exorbitant amounts of money. I've never had too much problem with smelly shoes, but if I ever do, I'm putting tea bags in them to absorb the odor",Neutral
672," I have had problems with some really smelly shoes, usually when they get wet.  I will need to try the tea bag thing next time it happens.",Curious to dive deeper
672," If it works, it's a cheap solution, though not as cheap as the shoes Stephon Marbury promoted, but wasn't paid to endorse. Maybe it's because they sold for only $15",Surprised
672,Maybe those are the same shoes Steve Smith leaves on the field after each game to raise awareness to the homeless people without shoes.,Neutral
672," I wonder if he buys his cleats in bulk. He probably doesn't choose his cleats based on fashion, but more about function",Curious to dive deeper
672," Most likely, thats how I treat my shoes.  They are for comfort and function and doesnt matter how they look, or if they are popular.",Neutral
672,I wonder which shoes are the best for traveling around the world. King Kalakaua of Hawaii probably had a good pair on his trek to become the first king to travel around the world,Neutral
672," They would have to be pretty durable, there are some places like Mackinac Island where motorized vehicles are banned.",Neutral
672,That's a lot of walking and biking to places. I wonder how healthy they are in comparison to other places,Curious to dive deeper
673,Donald Ritchie just died - man he was amazing at running long distances,Curious to dive deeper
673,He was. He set many world records!,Happy
673,I cannot imagine running for 24 hours straight like he set records doing!,Curious to dive deeper
673," Me either! I'm really not fond of running. Speaking of sports, did you know ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shoes per week?",Happy
673,Yes that is a lot of money!  I wonder why 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes?,Curious to dive deeper
673," I'm guessing they were just made with better materials, though i'm not sure. I wonder what the first shoe was made out of.",Happy
673,I am not sure.  I do know I always stick dry tea bags in my sons shoes - they stink and it helps with the odor,Curious to dive deeper
673,Seems like a pretty good idea. My son also has really stinky shoes!,Happy
673,I need to buy him more of Stephen Marbury's shoes - they were only $15 and he was actually paid to not endorse them,Curious to dive deeper
673," Hm, that's interesting. Who is Stephen Marbury? ",Curious to dive deeper
673,He is a well known NBA player.  I like Steve Smith as well - he is an NFL player who leaves his cleats on the field after every game to raise awareness of the homeless,Curious to dive deeper
673,That's a really cool thing for him to do. Do you travel much?,Curious to dive deeper
673,I love to travel though I am not sure of going 160 miles per hour on a bus in the Netherlands!,Curious to dive deeper
673,That seems pretty scary. I heard talk of them making a really fast mode of transportation like that in America too.,Happy
673,But no on Mackinac Island - only bicycles or horse drawn carriages,Curious to dive deeper
673,I'm sure its very peaceful there. I walk a lot and one thing I hate are cars whizzing past me!,Happy
673,No doubt.  In Iceland people without cars have to fly - there are no trains there,Curious to dive deeper
673,I'm sure that could get pretty annoying when visiting. In Japan the highway tolls can cost more than 300$ to travel across country!,Happy
673,Yes I have been to Japan!  Everything is expensive there!  I wonder if it was back when King Kalakaua traveled the world?,Curious to dive deeper
673,I've always wanted to visit Japan! I wonder what the king thought of places in Asia and Europe.,Happy
673,That is a good question.  I definitely liked the food better in Europe!,Neutral
674,Do you Run?,Curious to dive deeper
674," No, I don't.  Do you?",Neutral
674," No, I was reading about Donald Ritchie though. He passed away at 73. I guess he was a gifted runner.",Surprised
674," Yeah, it seemed like it.  I had never heard of ultrarunning before.  Hard to imagine running that far!",Surprised
674," I can't imagine running for 5 minutes, let alone over 2 hours.",Curious to dive deeper
674,LOL.  Me too!  My knees are hurting even thinking about it,Happy
674,Amen! This guy ran for 100 miles around London's crystall place. He would be able to go anywhere just by running there!,Surprised
674," That is so nuts.  He did it all with under 7 minute miles, too.  That is impressive!",Surprised
674,And he did 844 miles in 10 days! Wow!,Surprised
674," I like how he said ""you must be a little crazy"" when explaining ultrarunning lol  ",Surprised
674," I guess so. It must be addicting too. Urinating while running though, Gross!",Disgusted
674," Yeah, that's a dealbreaker for sure lol just imagine the smell!",Surprised
674,Terrible! I guess quite a few people thought he ran in his kilt!,Surprised
674,Right.  He did wear it hoping to get a lift from Scotland to Finland lol,Surprised
674,Must have had excellent legs! At 18 he found out he had more stamina then most for running. Thats a long career!,Curious to dive deeper
674,LOL it definitely is!  And he only accepted a sponsor that provided him with shoes,Curious to dive deeper
674,Good guy! Both his parents died from cancer. That's pretty sad.,Curious to dive deeper
674," Yeah, that is sad.  Apparently he had heart problems. ",Sad
674,After all that running? You would think he would have a perfect heart! Joe Jackson died too apparently.,Sad
674,It is surprising.  You'd think he would be in great shape.  I wonder if the running was too much and caused his heart to be unders stress to often.,Surprised
674," Maybe so, he said he often ran dehydrated. That could really stress your heart.",Curious to dive deeper
674,It absolutely can. Have a great day!,Curious to dive deeper
675,Good morning!! I learned a little interesting trivia... Denis Cyplenkov has the biggest and most dense muscles in the whole world!! He's an arm wresting champion... go figure!!,Surprised
675," Wow!  His hands must be intense!!  I don't know a lot about wrestling, but it's pretty funny that the Turkish national sport is oil wrestling!",Curious to dive deeper
675,Haha!!! That's pretty interesting!! Abraham Lincoln was pretty good at wrestling... He only lost once in 300 matches...that's pretty impressive!! It earned him a spot in the Wrestling Hall of Fame!!,Curious to dive deeper
675,That is impressive...of all the things people talk about with Abe Lincoln why do they leave that out?  I'm sure he was pretty proud of it!  Plato was a professional wrestler before becoming a famous philosopher.  I always pictured his more bookish...but I guess I was wrong!,Curious to dive deeper
675," Strong arms are not just good for wrestling, it helps when you're dunking basketballs, too. Kareem abdul Jabbar had his dominant dunk shot banned from college basketball...I guess those arms were dunking a little bit too strong!!",Curious to dive deeper
675," That just doesn't seem fair!  The guy was good at dunking, so they punished him?!?  Speaking of basketball, the inventor of basketball, James Naismith, is the only coach in the University of Kansas's history to lose!",Curious to dive deeper
675,Too bad for him because I know it had to affect his pay. In 39 out of 50 states the profession that is highest paid by the state is either a college basketball coach or a college football coach.,Curious to dive deeper
675," I could see that.  I think if he invented the sport it likely wasn't making much money to begin with.  I think it's probably more embarrasing than anything else!  ""The Highest Court in the Land"" is on the top floor of the Supreme Court!  I like their sense of humor!",Curious to dive deeper
675," Yes!!! Well, basketball isn't the only sport affected by bans of things that helped perfermance, in the world of swimming, there is a swimsuit that was worn 94% of the time in winning swim races... and now that suit has been BANNED!!! ",Curious to dive deeper
675,Well it makes sense to ban that!  I can't believe the technology in cloths...was it made out of dolphin skin?  That's pretty impressive!  Have you ever heard of the crawl stroke?  Is it like the butterfly stroke?,Curious to dive deeper
675,I haven't heard of the crawl stroke but I am quite impressed with the competitive swimming where hands and legs are tied and the swimmer has nothing else to help their performance while they swim like a dolphin!!! Sheer strength is whats needed to be competitive there!!,Curious to dive deeper
675," That is very impressive!  I think I would drown if I tried that... I guess in a swimming competition between the British and the Native Americans, the Natives Americans won with their front crawl swimming stroke.  The British relied on the breast stroke and lost!",Curious to dive deeper
675," Swimming is quite competitive, indeed! The United States seems to hold its own worldwide... The U.S. has as many gold medals as the rest of the whole world COMBINED!! Pretty impressive!!",Curious to dive deeper
675," That is impressive!  I wonder how many of those we won with those fancy swimming suits?  Humans can hold their breaths underwater and swim within weeks of birth, too bad more parents don't get their kids swimming so young.  Maybe then the US would hold ALL the gold metals!!",Curious to dive deeper
675," I agree!! Cornell University has a requirement that ALL students MUST pass a simple, basic swim test BEFORE they can graduate!! More schools and Universities should follow suit with that!! Starting with elementay school, swimming should be required.",Curious to dive deeper
675," I had to take swimming lessons all through school, as a teenager I hated having swimming class and then rushing to get ready for the next class afterwards.  That was the only downside.  But I made sure to go to a college that didn't require a PE, lol!",Curious to dive deeper
675," I remember swimming in high school too. Swimming, basketball, wrestling, they all have some pretty impressive athletes with some impressive records... there are too many to mention but in the world of wrestling, WRESTLER OF THE YEAR, River Curtis caught my attention. He weighs only 138 pounds!! Wow!!",Curious to dive deeper
675," Wow, that's impressive.  I assume wrestlers only wrestle those within a similar body weight...but still.  King Sandoval wrestled with a minor fracture and multiple torn ligaments in his right hand, he managed to take thrid at the National Prep Championships!",Curious to dive deeper
675," Wow!!! King Sandoval must have mastered all the pins, grappling holds, joint locks and takedowns to make him wear that crown proudly!! Wrestling has definitely allowed him to maintain a superior position!!",Curious to dive deeper
675," Yeah, no kidding!  Another great champion was Nathaniel White, he won Bowie's first state championship in THIRTY YEARS!  I'm sure he'll be a local hero forever!!",Curious to dive deeper
675," I bet he will!! It's going to hard to beat that record!! WoW!!! Well, its been a pleasure talking to you today. Enjoy the rest of your day!! Good-bye!!!",Happy
675," You as well, bye!",Happy
676,What do you think about Morgan Freeman? I always thought he was a good guy but it seems like he's being accused of sexual harassment,Curious to dive deeper
676," Yeah, I was also disappointed when Cosby first got accused because I watched his show growing up. A lot of women have come forward and there were lots of witnesses too.",Sad
676," Yep I agree, a lot of times they don't have any proof so you don't know who to believe either. He was nominated for five Oscars, it would be a shame if this tarnished his legacy",Surprised
676," Sad that it happened so late in life too. I just don't know. I would think he would be smarter than that, but who knows.",Sad
676,Yes I don't know. What do you do for entertainment? Do you watch a lot of movies or play video games perhaps,Curious to dive deeper
676,I used to play video games in the original Nintendo era. Now I just watch Netflix.,Surprised
676," Yes I played the original Nintendo Entertainment System back in the 80s, it can only display 54 colors but that never bothered me",Happy
676," I know, i thought it was awesome. Suprising that it did not get discontinued till 2013.",Surprised
676," Yep it was definitely very popular! Kind of like how chickens were very popular in Britain, that use them for entertainment back in the time of 50 BC",Surprised
676," Yeah, I used to watch tv shows like Bill Nye when I was not playing Nintendo. Did you ever watch Bill Nye when you were younger? He got his break by winning a Steve Martin lookalike costume.",Curious to dive deeper
676," That's a really interesting way to get started with a career! So was Ronald Reagan, he was told he didn't look presidential but obviously we know how that turned out LOL",Surprised
676,Hilarious! I wonder how Morgan Freeman got his start. I know that he played a singing vampire obsessed with vegetables on the electric company. Maybe that was one of his first gigs because that does not sound very cool haha.,Curious to dive deeper
676," That is interesting. I did like him in the movie Seven though, he was in that with Brad Pitt did you see that movie?",Curious to dive deeper
676,I don't think I did. Will have to check that out. Samuel I Jackson was mentored by Morgan Freeman.,Surprised
676," Wow I didn't know that. I like both of them actually, did you know that Morgan Freeman plays golf one-handed? I know that Samuel Jackson plays a lot of golf, I wonder if they ever played together ",Curious to dive deeper
676," Interesting, and I guess that was not by choice as he hurt his left hand in a car crash. Wonder if he is any good.",Surprised
676," Yes I wonder about that too, did you ever see the movie Driving Miss Daisy by the way? That's one of my favorites and he was in it, he played the driver",Curious to dive deeper
676," I did not see that either. It is probably good, most of his stuff is. He has been nominated for and won more awards than the number of movies he has been in.",Surprised
676," It is very impressive! I don't think he has as many wins as Daniel Day-Lewis does though, he won best actor three times",Surprised
676," Speaking of oscars, the oscars were nominated for nine emmys in 2013. ",Surprised
676," That is interesting how they can feed off each other like that, have you ever seen the movie Blazing Saddles by the way? It was nominated for three Oscars",Curious to dive deeper
677,I have always been a fan of comedy. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
677," Yes, I do like comedy but horror movies are my favorite.  What is your favorite movie?",Curious to dive deeper
677,One of my favorites of all time is the Life of Brian. Have you seen it?,Curious to dive deeper
677," Oh my goodness, I watched that years and years ago, I can't really remember much about the movie.  Who starred in it?",Curious to dive deeper
677,It was the cast of Monty Python's Flying Circus. Eric Idle is one that most people would know in America. Cause he did a lot of American Movies.,Happy
677," Yes, I remember it now. I can remember babysitting for my neighbors when I was a teen and the late night show was Monty Python, I would watch it but the comedy skits went right over my head, so to speak.  Now, as an adult, I can appreciate it more.",Neutral
677,I watched it on PBS because it had nudity in the cartoons. I guess PBS could get away with that. You didn't see that on the regular networks.,Happy
677,That is so true!  PBS and Do you remember the National Geographic magazines showing the natives of other countries topless?,Surprised
677," Oh lord. Yeah, you would go to the library to see those. At least we did, we couldn't afford a subscription. I found out that George Harrison paid for the production of their movie.",Happy
677," I didn't know that, about George Harrison. Did you know that the highest paid tv celebrity is Judge Judy? She gets 123,000 per episode! I should have been a judge....lol",Surprised
677,I didn't even know she was still on TV. I like the MEMEs they make with her forehead slapping unbelievable face. I wonder if she has ever been on Sesame Street. I heard Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on it.,Happy
677," yes those are funny. I love Carol Burnett, she's such great comedian and a nice person.  Have you seen the youtube videos that make collaboration of judge judy episodes? They are great videos.",Happy
677,I haven't. I'll have to look it up. I need to see if the old Mython's are there too. It's said that Chapman died. I heard he got drunk on set a lot.,Curious to dive deeper
677," Yes i heard that too, I think Chapman is dead. There's not any real good tv like there used to be. Most of the time I watch old perry mason, andy griffith and a lot of 80's shows like Charlies Angels, Matlock, etc. Thank goodness for reruns....lol",Neutral
677," I stopped watching regular TV.  I only stream things recorded on my iPhone. No cable, no networks, no Dish. Save's a lot of money. Don't have a lot like Lebron who is the second highest paid after Judy.",Surprised
677," I can't wait until my 190.00 a month cable contract is up, I'm canceling it and doing like you do, stream only with internet. My elderly mom lives with me, I take care of her, that's why I have the cable to begin with.  She wouldn't understand how to stream anything, never been on a computer and doesn't want to learn it at all.",Happy
677," OOps, I meant Judy was second after Lebron. You can get shows off YouTube that she will like. You can download Youtube for just 9..99 a month. I like comedies with Robin Williams, I found out he was the first celebrity to do the voice for a animated film. It was Aladdin.",Happy
677," Oh ya, I remember youtube sending me a message, that they have streaming tv now for cheap. I loved Robin Williams, I didn't know he was the first.",Surprised
677,Actually I also cancelled wifi. I found out you can download to your phone at the library and then watch it at home with no connection. I get Prime Video because I like Prime anyway for free shipping. They have a ton of great shows. Probably second only to Netflix.,Happy
677," Oh, that's a smart idea. I like that. Yes I have the Prime service also, such a great thing and I love the 2 day free shipping, you can't beat it. I buy everything that way now.",Surprised
677," Also, they have Prime music. I just found out that Steven Spielberg played the clarinet in the Jaws soundtrack. I bet they have Jaws on Prime. In Richmond V.A. they 2 hour shipping for Prime Members.",Happy
677," I  bet they do have Jaws on Prime, wow Steven Spielberg plays Clarinet like me! The 2 hour shipping is a fantastic option also.",Surprised
678,Do you enjoy reading?,Neutral
678," It's actually one of my favorite pastimes. I definitely would have been part of the ""Moral Panic"" had I lived in the 18th century, because I love novels",Neutral
678,I like reading since it promotes deep exploration of texts and can help build worlds in your mind,Neutral
678," I mean, even the military has reading lists. I heard three of the five branches have added Starship Troopers as their first sci-fi novel",Neutral
678,I think ender's game is another recommendation for the military. I loved it in high school,Neutral
678," I haven't read it, but I should add that to my list. I wish I could read anywhere close to the world record held by Anne Jones. 4,700 wpm would get me through a lot of books",Neutral
678,I wonder how much of the 4700 she actually digests,Neutral
678," A skill like that would only be helpful if you have a photographic memory. Though, I wouldn't want to remember all the terrible poetry if I entered a ""You Laugh You Lose"" contest like the ones C.S. Lewis and Tolkien would hold",Neutral
678,This is kind of a digression but lebron james has photographic memory so he can replay every game he has ever played,Neutral
678,That's impressive! I wonder if he has interest in reading. Everyone likes a good fiction book,Neutral
678,Is fiction your favorite genre?,Neutral
678,Most of the time. It would be interesting to find the wiki that ranks fictional characters. Not all of them have powers and abilities,Curious to dive deeper
678,Do you prefer fiction or fantasy?,Neutral
678,It depends on the author. I think mostly fiction. I should tru to find the writing Edgar Allen Poe did that has a cyborg,Neutral
678,So did Poe create the concept of cyborgs?,Neutral
678," He's the oldest known example, so I guess the credit goes to him",Neutral
678," I mean it is a shame how credit isn't always fairly awarded. I remember there was a seclusive scientist who found a dozen or so elements decades before other scientists yet since he never was too public about his research, the credit went to those scientists",Neutral
678,Wow. I wonder if that was the beginning of science fiction. There was a comic in the 50s that a judge tried to ban because one of the characters is black,Neutral
678,That judge should have been banned from court instead,Neutral
678,It's possible that he was. Do you ever read fan fiction?,Curious to dive deeper
678,Rarely. Do you?,Neutral
678," Not really, but the fan fiction that Julius Caesar wrote about Hercules would likely be an interesting read",Neutral
679," Hi there, do you watch movies at al?",Curious to dive deeper
679," I do, my favorite genre is comedy, do you like movies?",Curious to dive deeper
679,Yeah that is my favorite genre too. Do you like bromantic comedies then?,Curious to dive deeper
679," Yeah The Hangover is one of my favorite movies, well all 3 of them, ",Curious to dive deeper
679,I loved that movie too. How about tv shows that are comedies? Like 3rd rock from the sun?,Curious to dive deeper
679," I havent heard about that show before, is it any good?",Curious to dive deeper
679," I have seen a few episodes of it and it is good but I do not think it is better than Friends, however it beat it to win an award",Curious to dive deeper
679," I love Friends thats like my favorite show and yeah doesnt seem righ, do you know who Demetri Martin is",Curious to dive deeper
679," Yeah he is a super funny guy, guess it paid off to drop off of Harvard Law to pursue comedy",Curious to dive deeper
679," I guess it did, hard decision to make though",Curious to dive deeper
679,True. Do you know who Ryan Stiles is?,Curious to dive deeper
679," No, who is Ryan Stiles is he also a famous comedian?",Curious to dive deeper
679,Yeah he is and similarly he dropped out of high school to focus on comedy,Curious to dive deeper
679," I guess that paid off for him as well, still a harsh decision, if your dream is comedy you must at least finish high school and then persue it",Curious to dive deeper
679," I agree but good thing it worked for him. Speaking of famous people, do you know who is the highest paid celebrity?",Curious to dive deeper
679,Im guessing its Judge Judy she makes about $123000 per episode when you sum it up its a lot of money,Curious to dive deeper
679,Yeah she is the second one in the list I think with LeBron being the first guy,Curious to dive deeper
679," Oh thats right, Lebron does earn a lot of money, that makes sense, did you know there is a secret room at Pixar studios",Curious to dive deeper
679,Is that the one that only celebrities are allowed to access?,Curious to dive deeper
679," Yeah celebrities, directors and wealthy people, did you like Robin Williams in Aladdin? ",Curious to dive deeper
679,I did and he was the first guy to stat the trend of celebrities doing voices.,Happy
680," Hi, how are you?",Happy
680,I'm doing great! Did you know that Adam Sandler has a special on Netflix?,Happy
680,I heard about it. Supposedly it was really good. Did you see it?,Curious to dive deeper
680," I haven't. I'm luke warm on watching anything of his. Sometimes it's hilarious, but a lot of times for me it falls flat. ",Neutral
680,Yeah. I usually end up drinking too much and then thinking turning on one of his movies would be a great idea. Then I end up drinking more to pass the time and then fall asleep an hour in. It's a vicious cycle.,Happy
680," That sounds about what happens with me as well. I really like a lot of the newer shows that Netflix has been producing though, I'm sure it has to cost them quite a lot though. ",Curious to dive deeper
680," What shows are you getting into. Everytime I open netflix, nothing really pops out to me...",Curious to dive deeper
680," The new Sabrina show was awesome. I really enjoyed it as a comic when I was younger, and I was happy with how well it was done. I only use the online streaming service, but I remember when it first started getting dvd's in the mail. ",Curious to dive deeper
680,Me too! And were you a comic when you were younger or the younger show of Sabrina that was a comedy?,Curious to dive deeper
680,Sabrina was a comic book when I was a kid. I read it back then.,Neutral
680,Gotcha! I was about to go into a lot of questions about your comedy career but I will save it. Anything else you are watching?,Curious to dive deeper
680," I've been watching the Medici which is another show produced by Netflix, it's really good as well. Mostly historically accurate, which is better than most.  ",Neutral
680," Sounds interesting. I watched a little of a viking show (not called viking but cannot remember what it was called) and that was ok. Im just not that into tv anymore, other than live sports.",Neutral
680," I don't watch a lot of TV either. I have it on in the background when I do homework mostly, and that's it. I do like seeing what movies Rotten Tomatoes has disliked lately. (But I hardly ever end up watching movies either)",Neutral
680,Sandler has 2 movies with a 0 rotten tomatoes score. Ha!,Happy
680," lol yeah, and Spykids has a 93%.  Which is crazy. My kid loves that movie, but I just find it annoying. ",Surprised
680,It's that high!!!! 150 movies with 100% and I can't find one I like.,Sad
680,They have some good music documentaries on there if you like that.,Neutral
680,What would you recommend?,Curious to dive deeper
680," There is one about the Eagles if you like that type of music, I enjoyed it a lot. I think there is one on there about Queen as well. ",Neutral
680,I'll check them out. Nice chatting with you!,Happy
681," Voting is a method to elect their representative, it is the duty of every citizen to cast their vote and select their representative for the nation.",Happy
681," Yea, India takes voting seriously, they set up a polling booth in a forrest with lions for one voter",Neutral
681,Astronauts vote from space. It shows voting is very important to the nation. Voting is the biggest gift to people in the democratic nation.,Happy
681,It's a shame that 34% of the black male population have permanently  lost the right to vote,Disgusted
681,It affects the entire democracy of the nation. Voting means people are also in the part of the government. People enjoy the vast power.,Happy
681," Yes, in the UK not all the men had the opportunity to vote until 1918",Neutral
681," But today, all people have voting rights. It is the power of the people. Ordinary people can change the government.",Surprised
681," They have the right to vote but not a lot of choices, since 1853 all presidents have been either republican or democrat",Sad
681,But people only choose the leader. In election campaigns all the party leaders canvas the people.,Happy
681," Yea, I guess it's better than appointing officials by lottery like they did in Ancient Athens",Neutral
681," Nevada is the only state to have a ""none of these candidates"" voting option for presidential elections. Election is the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century.",Happy
681," Yea, it's a shame that voter turnout has breached 62.8% in  the past century",Neutral
681,In 2012 US elections international electoral observers were blocked from the polls in nine states . It is very shameful to us. Real democracy is a transparent form of government.,Surprised
681,Yea that is deplorable. It's strange that since 1900 the taller candidate has one the presidential election 75% of the time,Neutral
681,It very crazy. Astrology can't work in guessing the election result.,Surprised
681,No I guess not. It's also peculiar that the only presidents with beards were republicans,Neutral
681,Republican party candidates have won most elections.,Curious to dive deeper
681,It's a shame that a Nixon or Bush has been on each winning Republican ticket since 1928,Disgusted
681,Yeah. Vice nice chatting with you. Have a great day.,Surprised
681," Yea, you too, I'm gonna google some info about the Grand Ole Party",Neutral
681,Ok. The Republican Party is one of the major political parties in US. It was founded in 1854 they took anti-slavery and pro-economic reform ideological stances.,Curious to dive deeper
681," Well I got to go, have a nice night",Neutral
682," HEY, DO YOU WATCH nETFLIX?",Happy
682,I love Netflix! Tell me something about Netflix,Curious to dive deeper
682," It did something really awesome by signing Adam Sandler to a 4 movie deal in 2014, do you like Adam Sandler?",Happy
682,I like some of his films. He probably will get a good following on Netflix.,Curious to dive deeper
682," yeah I love him too, I read it somehwere that he is gonna be doing a movie in which he is going to sing, can you imagine him singing?",Curious to dive deeper
682,He did some silly songs on SNL I think. He is working with some topnotch actors. I think there should be some good films coming from him.,Curious to dive deeper
682," Yeah I think he will be clowning around aping artists like Bruce Springsteen, lol, I would love to see that. really. ",Happy
682,I think it's great that Netflix is willing to bank some films like these. The Hollywood system is broken. How did Netflix get started anyway?,Curious to dive deeper
682," It starrted in 2012, but now its big and spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth. ",Curious to dive deeper
682,I believe it. Bandwidth is getting cheaper. I heard the founder got pissed off about late fees or something. Blockbuster blew it!,Curious to dive deeper
682," Yeah I know, that was insane, I wish Blockbuster had an eye in the future when it declined several offers to buy Netflix for $50 million because now Netflix is worth $2 billion. ",Curious to dive deeper
682," Blockbuster was stuck in the past. They were thinking that people had time to drive around to stores. Computers, tablets, cell phones. I want convenience from companies!",Curious to dive deeper
682," That is so true, Comfort is key in today's entertainment. ",Neutral
682,Quality is part of their success too. I've heard that Netflix has a ton of high quality films available.,Curious to dive deeper
682," yeah thats so tru, it has specials and movies staring awesome stars like Terry Crews, Steve Buscemi, Danny Trejo and Nick Nolte.",Happy
682,I love those guys! I've heard Netflix has over 100 films that nabbed full marks on Rotten Tomatoes.,Curious to dive deeper
682," That is awesome to know, I know ratings mean a lot in the entertainment industry, but do you know more of how Rotten Tomatoes works?",Happy
682,I was started by some kids at UC Berkeley. The site aggregates reviews from professional reviewers.,Neutral
682," Ohh That's cool, Professional Reviewers that's where it gets the reputation I read somewhere that Rotten Tomatoes is owned by Warner Bros.",Happy
682,I think Warner saw the chance  to promote its movies on the site.,Curious to dive deeper
682," Ohhh Now I get it, lol makes more sense when you put it like that. Do you play or like any video games?",Happy
682,Sometimes. Great chat! Thanks!,Neutral
683,Hi!  Did you ever play nintendo?,Curious to dive deeper
683,Oh yeah I did.  I still do.  One of the best gaming systems ever!,Happy
683,Nice!  I can't believe they have been around over 100 years.  They were founded as a playing card company in 1889!,Happy
683,How far they have come.  I think they made a wise choice focusing on video games.  Mario and Zelda made them billions,Curious to dive deeper
683,Oh yeah!  Nintendo has a market value of over $85 billion dollars!,Happy
683,They made enough money to buy the Seattle Mariners.,Curious to dive deeper
683,Yes they did!  Because they own them there is a 3DS app that allows you to order food direct to your seat!,Happy
683," Wow, you can play Pokemon and order a hot dog at the same time!",Happy
683,Yes! lol ...and you can use the handheld console that Nintendo released in 2001 specifically for Pokemon. lol,Happy
683,I think one of my favorites has to be Super Smash Brothers.  It is such a fun game and it is great to play at parties,Surprised
683,That game I think is the best game of all time.  Nintendo also produced a lego knock off when they were a toy company.  Interesting.,Happy
683,A lot of companies have made lego knockoffs.  Never as good as the real thing.,Happy
683,No.  lol  So do you like snakes?  I'm not a fan.,Curious to dive deeper
683," I am not afraid of them, but I would not have one as a pet.  ",Curious to dive deeper
683,There is a genus of flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey.  H*** no!  Yikes!,Happy
683,That is awesome.  Now that sounds like something you would see in a Mario Game,Surprised
683,Yes!  lol  I think I like New Zealand a whole lot better because there are no snakes there!,Happy
683,Maybe because something bigger and scarier ate them all.  Think about that possibility.,Curious to dive deeper
683,Yikes!  lol  The fear of snakes is hard wired not only in human brains but also in monkey brains.  I knew I always shared a lot in common with monkeys.  lol  I had fun chatting!,Happy
683,Yeah me too.  Try not to worry too much about snakes,Happy
683,I won't I promise! lol Have a great night!,Happy
684," Netflix was founded in 1997, it's older than I thought. ",Curious to dive deeper
684,I think it's amazing Blockbuster could have bought them,Surprised
684,Especially considering that they're worth 2 billion dollars!,Curious to dive deeper
684,It's also hilarious that they take up 33% of the bandwidth in NA during the evening.,Surprised
684,It's even funnier that it all started with a $40.00 late fee on Apollo 13.,Surprised
684,So basically it's late fees on Apollo 13 that we have to blame for Adam Sandler's Netflix special.,Surprised
684," Haha, I think I've liked 1 or 2 things over his very long career!",Happy
684," There a couple early movies I liked, but he deserves his recent string of Rotten Tomato losses, in my opinion!",Neutral
684,Agreed. His childish songs always drove me nuts.,Neutral
684,They usually are pretty terrible but I'd be curious about the Farley song; sometimes people surprise you when it's a sentimental issue for them.,Curious to dive deeper
684," I'm curious to see it as well, I'm sure I'll end up watching the special some late night.",Curious to dive deeper
684," I probably will too, if just out of morbid curiosity.  To be fair I tend to like Netflix specials, so maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised.",Neutral
684,It must be hard to be married to comedians and end up as subjects of their jokes and songs.,Curious to dive deeper
684," I don't know what would be worse, being the butt of their jokes and they're super successful and popular, or the butt of their jokes and they bomb.",Curious to dive deeper
684," Definitely if they're bombing. Or no wait, if they're successful more people hear it.  Hmm, that's tough.",Curious to dive deeper
684," Probably the bombing.  If they're popular, at least they'll be getting specials and money and all that.  Maybe you can buy nice stuff with the sweet, sweet Netflix cash.",Happy
684," Ha, Netflix is rolling in cash. It's how they produce so many of their own shows.  Granted, some are pretty good.",Curious to dive deeper
684," I've seen a ton of stuff from them that I've really, really enjoyed.  It's kind of cool to see what people can make when they are just handed a pile of money and let loose.",Happy
684,I so want that opportunity.  Someone needs to just throw money at me! :-),Happy
684,Hahaha yeah!  I want to pitch them my comedic animated Korean drama monster cooking gourmet food after the apocalypse TV series!,Happy
684,That sounds amazing! Totally would watch it.,Happy
684,Hahaha right?  I should go and write it up and submit it now.,Happy
684,Do it. :-)    Nice chatting with you!,Happy
684,Nice chatting with you too!! Have a good one!,Happy
684,You too.,Happy
685,Hello! So do you get into politics at all?,Happy
685,i sometimes pay attention. it can be depressing. do you follow politics?,Neutral
685," I follow sometimes. I think it is pretty important these days to keep up on what is going on, but I am not outspoken like celeb's, Taylor Swift and Kanye.",Happy
685,I distrust celebrities talking about politics. i dont think they know enough about the process and the issues. they are famous. thats it.,Neutral
685," I tend to agree but they are citizens but often go overboard. I guess if I had a following on instagram like Taylor Swift who cared what I had to say about politics, voting etc I would talk freely. I do feel we shouldn't be divided into, Republicans or Democrats though...we are all in this together. So do you vote in the presidential elections?",Curious to dive deeper
685," I try to. I think it is important to vote, even if it might not seem to make a difference. I think the divisions are artificial and create polarization and conflict.",Neutral
685," I vote, but I completely understand your point. Sometimes I think the system is rigged anyway but I vote just so I can feel like I did my duty. I never have a side, I am not Republican or Democrat, just want to vote whoever is the best for our country.",Happy
685,I figure that whoever gets in probably has been backed by moneyed interests. that is their first allegiance.,Neutral
685,Exactly. I think voting should be changed somehow. But we all know it won't happen. Just like in 2012...in 9 states voters were blocked from the polls.,Happy
685," How could that happen in the US? i feel like the country is going backwards. in Alabama, many black men cant vote. Isnt this a human right? we dont have enough people voting as it is.",Neutral
685," I agree 100%. We as a country seem to be going through some very crazy times right now and God only knows what will happen in our future. Not much makes sense. But for some Indians, their government set up a strange polling booth in a forest full of lions! ",Happy
685,I think there is an obligation there for the govt to reach out to the people and make sure that they can vote. I wish the polls were handled better in the US,Neutral
685,I wish the same. The Government is supposed to be for the people....all the people. You don't see our Government caring about anything but what they see fit to deal with. It is ridiculous,Neutral
685," once the money gets in there, it distorts the process. there should be limits on contributions. that would limit the power of money.",Neutral
685,I agree! There is so much going on behind the scenes that we really have no idea what they really do. Even if they said no more huge contributions etc we the people would never know for sure.,Neutral
685," True, the money can move in many directions to buy favors. it is nefarious. most regular americans are not that greedy.",Neutral
685,Agree again. It is all about the money and that is sad.,Sad
685," Well, perhaps you can change some things at the local level. civic govt and such. or through NGOs. elections are hard to win, but maybe you can make change a different way.",Neutral
685,True. Officials in Ancient Athens were appointed by a lottery....that's pretty interesting!,Happy
685," I think that would help put new people in power, but maybe they would get bought. i would like to know that we get some help some of the time. Doesnt have to be all the time.",Neutral
685," Yep, true. Money is always going to be a problem in this country. Greed is evil and ruins everything. I just hope for future elections and for voting something changes and we can get to be back on track. It has been great chatting!",Happy
685,I hope that people get the chance to make their voices heard. Great chat!,Neutral
685,bye!,Happy
685," Talk to you soon, I'm sure!",Neutral
685,hope so!,Happy
686,Do you play Nintendo games like Super Smash Bros?,Curious to dive deeper
686,I do! I have a Switch at home and was excited for the game to come out. Do you play them?,Neutral
686,I used to with my kids.  Maybe I should pick it up again. I guess the new one had all the older characters?,Curious to dive deeper
686,I think so. They added a few new characters too,Neutral
686," What is ""air dodging""? Does that mean you can dodge stuff in midair? ",Curious to dive deeper
686," Yeah, I was never very good at it. I'm still pretty old school and just button mash most of the time. I think they are making it to where you can only do it so many times in this new game. ",Neutral
686,It seems like Nintendo really does listen to its customers.  They have always been a company that makes quality stuff.,Happy
686,They really are a great company. You know they you are getting quality when you buy something from them. They have a  market value of over $85 billion. Which is crazy.,Curious to dive deeper
686,Wow.  I know their consoles survived my kids so that's something. Some people think the games made for them can sometimes be too technical.,Curious to dive deeper
686," I can see that. I'm not a big gamer by any means, and sometimes the games are a bit much for me. I think though that they have to have some sort of balance so that the games are entertaining for all types of people. ",Neutral
686,They have a history with that having been founded in 1889 as a playing card company.,Curious to dive deeper
686," Yeah, and they made lego knock-offs which is kind of neat. ",Neutral
686,You can tell you're doing OK when you own a MLB team. Nintendo owns the Mariners.,Neutral
686,Really? That's cool. I didn't know they did.,Neutral
686,Did you know there are no snakes in New Zealand?  I wouldn't miss them too much.,Surprised
686," Really? I know there are no snakes in Ireland. A neat fact about snakes, the fear of them is hard-wired in human and monkey brains. ",Curious to dive deeper
686," It's true for me I think.  I used to catch them as a kid but not now. Speaking of Nintendo, the original NES only displayed 54 colors.",Neutral
686," It wasn't discontinued until 2003 in Japan! I like the original, I wish I still had one. ",Neutral
686," Actually, me too. Maybe eBay?  I think it's funny the Bill Nye got his break my looking like Steve Martin.  Don't see it...",Curious to dive deeper
686," There are a few places around where I live that sell them, they are just too expensive. Steve Martin? I really don't see it at all. But Ronald Reagan was once rejected for a role because he didn't look ""presidential.""",Neutral
686,Funny for Reagan.  Thanks for the excellent chat!,Happy
687,hey did you know that astronauts can vote when they are in outer space?,Surprised
687," Haha, I did not know that... How do they cast their ballot?  Do they have to submit an absentee ballot before going into space?",Curious to dive deeper
687,haha good question! also crazy is that not all men could vote in the United Kingdom until 1918,Surprised
687,That is crazy!  Did you know that a dog beat two people in a mayoral election and served as mayor for 13 years?,Surprised
687,no but that must mean the other choices were horrible haha would you vote for a dog?,Curious to dive deeper
687,I would vote for a dog in certain situations...,Disgusted
687," haha that is funny, also funny is how that Texas town renamed their garbage dump to the name Fred Durst",Happy
687," I'm not too familiar with Fred Durst, but he must be really disliked if they named a garbage dump after him, lol.  In relation to the dog being elected mayor, a cat named Hank placed third in a Virginia senate election.",Surprised
687," ya hes a famous musician that most people don't like haha, do you know that republicans and democrat parties have only existed since about 1853?",Surprised
687," That's weird, I didn't know that.  I honestly wish we'd get rid of the parties.  There's lots of weird statistics in elections.  Since 1980, the faster blinker in presidential debates has lost every time.",Surprised
687," wow that is weird, also I know that the taller president wins about 75% of the time",Surprised
687," I can understand that... I think when most people think of an ideal leader, the physical characteristics usually consist of being tall.  I can't explain it, but it's pretty typical to want a taller person than a short one to be a leader.  Another fun animal fact:  a chimp received 400,000 votes in a mayor election, but came in 3rd",Surprised
687," haha wow, well it is sad that voter turnout in the usa only gets to be about 63% at best",Surprised
687," Yeah, that's pretty crappy... do you usually always vote during elections?  I can see that number only getting lower.  It seems like the younger generation aren't as motivated to actually get out and vote, despite their vocal opinion on matters.",Fearful
687," right taht is a good point, and yes I voted, what is scary in the 2012 election is that international observers were blocked from attending teh polls in 9 states",Surprised
687,That's crazy... I'm sure there are a lot of special interest groups in foreign countries that would love to mettle with our elections.  Illegal immigrants trying to vote is also becoming an increasing problem in the United States.,Fearful
687," yes I agree with that, what I never realized too is taht every president who sported a beard has been a republican haha",Surprised
687,I like that the republicans and democrats play a baseball game every year.  The republicans are currently winning the series by three wins.  I'd like to see them play football against each other...,Neutral
687," haha that would be interesting, also interesting is if they used different colors for republicans and democrats, red and blue only came into fashion in the year 2000",Surprised
687," That's weird, I figured red and blue had been around much longer than that.  As loved as JFK is, he actually voted against the Civil Rights Act in 1957.  Twitter would roast him if he were alive today.",Surprised
687," oh man, ya people would think very different about a lot of historical people, and yes we will see how they view Donald Trump 50 years from now",Curious to dive deeper
688,Are you comfortable talking about the election and voting?,Neutral
688," ya we can do that, did you hear that a chimp literally got like 400k votes back in 1988 for mayor?",Surprised
688,Really? For mayor of which state?,Neutral
688," well it was for Rio De Janeiro, but unfortuantely or fortunately he came in 3rd place haha",Surprised
688,I guess that was their alternative to having a none of these candidates voting option,Neutral
688," haha good point, did you know that canada would only ahve 50 electoral votes if we took it over and made it a state?",Surprised
688,I did not. I wonder if it would be for better or worse if everyone had to vote like in the UK since 1918,Curious to dive deeper
688," ya that is a good question, did you like JFK? I guess in 1957 he voted against the civil rights act",Surprised
688," That is a shame. I can't say I know enough to say I liked JFK, but I did think that he was vaguely among the more qualified people in the position of president so far. I wonder if there ever will be a 3rd party president",Neutral
688," that is a good quesiton, did you know that Hillary was a Republican back when she was in college?",Surprised
688,I wonder what made her change her affiliation?,Curious to dive deeper
688," thats a good question, did you know that Republicans and Dems do an annual baseball game? And republicans are up by 3 wins overall?",Surprised
688,I didn't. I did recently found out that every us president with a beard is a republican? Who knows maybe it is the invasion of the beard aliens,Neutral
688,haha that is wild! imagine hillary with a beard,Happy
688," She must have fended off the beard aliens and joined the other side after. By the way did you know that the red and blue colors for republicans and democrats are relatively recently, only starting in 2000",Neutral
688," no that is wild, also wild is that a us senator was arrested for civil disobedience, he was a repub. who was protesting apartheid",Surprised
688," That is a shame. He had a good head on his shoulder, but too bad he was too progressive for his time",Neutral
688," yup I agree, also progressive was apparently Richard NIxon, he wanted to pass a guaranteed minium income bill",Surprised
688," I personally find nixon to be mixed. There are some controversy that his war on drugs may have been a war on race. Even today for instance, 34% of the black male population in alabama permanently can't vote and the prisons are very heavily populated with minority populations",Neutral
688," ya I could see that, thats a valid argument, kind of crazy too that Ayn Rand who is a symbol for the tea party, was on social security and also medicare",Surprised
688," Many historic figures are on the right side of some issues and the wrong side of others since what people perceive to be right and wrong is subjective and reflective of a diverse amalgamation of bias. In any case, this chat with you was enjoyable. I hope you have a wonderful day.",Neutral
689,Do you like Nintendo?,Neutral
689,I do like Nintendo. Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
689,I like their graphics. The look and feel of Mario Brothers is nostalgic.,Neutral
689,I do love the look of that game. I really like the mario brothers franchise.,Happy
689," Yes, Pokemon and Zelda are good but nothing beats Mario Brothers. ",Neutral
689," Oooohhhh.... I do like the original legend of zelda. I wish they had that game for the ipad. I would play it so much! Well, I am now married with kids so maybe not...",Happy
689," Yes, I was a little old for the Nintendo games but my kids were into the Pokemon cards and the Nintendo DS.",Surprised
689,I have a son that is into pokemon and his cards are everywhere. They have 750 episodes and I think I have seen them all!,Happy
689,I did not know the company started with the playing cards and even tried a knock off Lego before video game.,Neutral
689,I think they found their niche! I could not imagine them doing legos or playing cards.,Surprised
689," Right, I would also love to play a little Nintendo on an iPad, maybe the racing game.",Neutral
689," Yeah, that would be great. Did you know they owned the mariners? I had no clue!",Surprised
689,That is interesting. That must be why they have technology in the game stadium. Apparently you can order food to your seat from an app.,Neutral
689," Yeah. Not sure I would trust seafood from a baseball stadium but if I did, it would be seatlle or baltimore.",Fearful
689," Yes, Seattle is a great place to get fresh seafood like Salmon and Shrimp. I do not like all seafood especially those that are squirmy.",Neutral
689," Me neither but my wife has turned me on to some of the less adventurous items like shrimp and some sushi. I like the baked stuff, which people will judge me for eating but, whatever...",Happy
689,Sushi is the best... except for the ones with octopus. I am against anything that reminds me of snakes.,Neutral
689,Right! I hate snakes. Might move to new zealand to escape them!,Happy
689,New Zealand is looking like a great place to live. No Snakes and the Hobbits live there.,Curious to dive deeper
689,There is a genus of flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey. I can't... NOPE!,Fearful
689,Launching Snakes is about the worst thing I have ever heard. I can't go to any place with launching snakes and crocodiles.,Curious to dive deeper
689,Yup Nice chatting with you!,Happy
690," Hello! I just got done reading about Stephen Colbert's explanation of God and information about Star Trek, did you read the same articles as me?",Curious to dive deeper
690," Yeah, I have those articles. I think it's interesting that before 1963, students in the US read the Bible as part of the primary education.",Surprised
690," Crazy how things used to be, what did you think about Stephen's views on God?",Neutral
690,He seems to think that Jesus is God. He has a very Christian view.,Neutral
690," I agree, it's interesting to see a celebrity talk about their egregious views. The fact that he had Rev. James Martin on his show is also interesting to me, most show hosts try to avoid those topics. ",Neutral
690,I would like to read Jefferson's version of the Bible and see what he wanted people to read.,Neutral
690," True, it's weird to think there is a pop culture pastor out there in the world. Did you watch much of Star Trek growing up? I only watched some, I wonder if they ever mentioned the bible in that show.  ",Curious to dive deeper
690,There were a couple of shows that mentioned Christian concepts. Generally the show was about morality. I didn't know that the Tower of Babel was based on a real building.,Neutral
690," I didn't know that either. The factual section of these articles was the most interesting thing to me, especially the part where it says that Martin Luther King talked to Nichols about her role.  ",Neutral
690," Nichelle Nichols was not certain about continuing the show, and he told her it was important for her to stay.",Neutral
690," I wonder how different things would be if she didn't stay, I'm glad he spoke to her about it and gave her advice. ",Neutral
690,Star Trek really changed how people viewed technology too. The flip phone was based on the communicator.,Neutral
690," Yeah I read about that too, I love that in modern day technology we were able to make something like that. Now we have something even better, smart phones, but still. I love how long Star Trek has been around for.  ",Neutral
690,So many people have appeared on the show. Tom Morello was on there twice.,Neutral
690," Yep! I like how they gave the fact about the door sound is just a piece of paper being removed from an envelope, I wonder what other weird sounds they used in that show. ",Neutral
690,The sound FX folks had to be inventive. The teleportation device was created because of the tight budgets.,Neutral
690,So cool. I wonder if Stephen Colbert ever watched Star Trek lol I'm sure he must have growing up.,Neutral
690,He was also a big fan of Lord of the Rings.,Neutral
690," I love those movies! I wish they put some facts about lord of the rings in these articles, or maybe even in the celebrity section. ",Neutral
690," Well, I've enjoyed chatting! Have a good day!",Happy
690,Same to you!,Neutral
690,Bye!,Happy
691,Are you familiar with Stephen Colbert?,Curious to dive deeper
691,just a little bit of the article i just read.  How does he start out with an explanation to god with broccoli?,Curious to dive deeper
691," It's a little bit odd. He says that if he holds a piece of broccoli, he wants his brain to be open to whether it will go up or down when dropped. He says that seeing God is similar.",Curious to dive deeper
691,Well he's never read the bible i guess?  We should go back to 1963 and require children in school to read the bible,Curious to dive deeper
691," He has read the Bible. He said one time when he was feeling spiritually lost, someone handed him a Bible. The page he opened to was one about worry, and he was feeling worried. So he believes that scripture can speak to you.",Surprised
691,I know the scriptures can speak to you! I'd rather talk about star trek and how martin luther king Jr convinced the acotr to continue to play uhuru,Surprised
691,I used to love Star Trek. I find it interesting that teleportation was only used because their budget couldn't afford having spaceships land on planets.,Surprised
691,Love the ingenuity!  Do you like rage against the machine?,Happy
691," No, I don't really. I don't know much about them.",Neutral
691,i do! And tom morello from rage against the machine was a trekkie and was lucky enough to be the show twice,Happy
691," That's cool. Wait a second, I just realized that the star trek door sound is just a piece of paper being removed from an envelope. I have to listen more carefully next time.",Curious to dive deeper
691,see... again ingenuity.... LOVE IT!!!  How about the flipphone and now the apple watch... they were definitely ahead of their time!,Surprised
691,It's amazing that the flip phone was inspired by Star Trek,Surprised
691,yeah it is!  I loved the Next Generation.  You ever seen it?,Curious to dive deeper
691,That was always my favorite one.,Happy
691,Loved the movies too.. i actually have the box set,Happy
691," How cool. I think there are some movies I still need to catch up on. I hope they create a new series one day. Star Trek was actually cancelled in 1969 because of poor ratings but when the reruns became popular, Paramount decided to expand the franchise.",Happy
691,There are a bunch of spinoffs... i think there are like 5 different series after the original.  The recent movies are really good too!,Happy
691,I'm glad they decided to go on beyond those first three seasons after which it was cancelled.,Happy
691,yeah mee too... many celebrities have come from the shows... look how it launched patric stewarts career!,Happy
691,I wish I was a celebrity. Then I could visit Pixar's secret room!,Happy
692," Are you religious, do you read the bible?",Curious to dive deeper
692,I am but I do not read the bible. Are you? do you read the bible?,Curious to dive deeper
692," Im not religious but I have read some parts of it, for instance you know the tower of Babel?",Curious to dive deeper
692,I did not! What is it?,Curious to dive deeper
692," Well apparently the tower of Babel is real, its based on a real building. The bible is full of surprises for sure",Curious to dive deeper
692," Prior to 1963, students in the us read the bible as part of their education. I do not think that would fly today.",Surprised
692," I agree, there are a lot of things in the bible that dont make sense and that science has proven wrong, ",Curious to dive deeper
692,Roosevelt and Adams did not use a bible when they were sworn in? What did they use?,Curious to dive deeper
692," No idea but I think they are the only two presidents to do things like that, Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the bible.",Curious to dive deeper
692," If you do not believe, make your own truth! Seems like a logical thing to do...",Surprised
692," I agree, just razor cuts all the parts you dont agree with, he didnt believe in miracles and resurrection.",Curious to dive deeper
692,He might have been famous enough to gain access to Pixar's secret room. I wonder what they got in there...,Curious to dive deeper
692," I wonder that as well it must be a really cool room dough, I bet the cast of Star Trek has been in that room or at least the leading actors",Curious to dive deeper
692," I want to see what's in there. What are they hiding. Unfortunately, I am not famous, like at all! Im barely on FaceBook so not many people know me.",Curious to dive deeper
692," Yeah same here, I dont have many friends in Facebook either, I bet Robin Williams was invited to the room, he was the voice of Aladdin after all""",Curious to dive deeper
692,I thought he did a great job as the Genie. I think he also created a movement by having celebreties voice cartoons.,Happy
692," He did start a trend, celebrities then started performing voices of cartoon characters, I wonder if Judge Judy ever did the voice of one!",Curious to dive deeper
692," She has no financial incentive to. She makes $123,000 per episode!",Surprised
692," That is a lot of money! I guess she doesnt, it would be interesting though, maybe some day she will.",Curious to dive deeper
692,I wonder if she gets syndication money too?,Curious to dive deeper
692," I dont think she does although that is a great question, do you know who Carol Burnett is?",Curious to dive deeper
692," I do, she's great. Nice chatting with you!",Happy
693," Hey how are you, what'd you think of Colbert's explanation of God?",Curious to dive deeper
693," Everyone has to be so politically correct these days!! He's on TV so they monitor everything these days!!  He should be honest as say how he feels, so we all would know the truth, instead of what they have told him to say!!",Curious to dive deeper
693," Haha exactly, it's funny how upset people get about that and then they're totally cool with the whole history of the church and priests mistreating kids and what not.",Curious to dive deeper
693," Yes, in Hollywood or in Politics where its all coming out now! Not the rest of the country! ",Neutral
693," For sure, it's so sad that people think that is okay. Have you ever read the bible",Curious to dive deeper
693," True, Yes, I have and believe in God!! Its interesting that Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible!",Surprised
693,It would be cool to read that bible too. To each their own! It's crazy that it was still required to read the bible in public schools until 1963.,Curious to dive deeper
693," Yes, public schools had a bible class. Its hard to have an opinion unless you've read it and understand. It would be interesting to see the tower of Babel!!",Curious to dive deeper
693," That would be really cool to see in Iraq, I've been there but didn't see anything biblical lol. It was a pretty cool place though, unfortunately it's been so destroyed by war.",Curious to dive deeper
693,Really that's interesting!! Scary place now! lol the Star trek door sound is just a piece of paper being removed from an envelope.,Surprised
693," I just had to reenact that sound just now lol, it would be hard to come up with those effects back in 1966 when it started! Did you like the show?",Curious to dive deeper
693,I watched when I was a little girl on TV. Ahead of its time for sure!!,Happy
693," Oh wow, I bet that color TV blew your mind? Or was it black and white still? I'm not sure when TV came out in color, hopefully no offense lol. ",Surprised
693," No thats funny. It came out color in the 50's, Star trek was in the 60 and 70's.  Captain Kurt and Spock were pretty cool! lol I see Uhuru the actor was convinced by Martin Luther King to stay on the show! lol",Surprised
693," I would have never of guessed that, I'm sure it was a difficult situation to be in for sure. Guess how much Judge Judy makes an episode?",Curious to dive deeper
693,I heard alot!! I think shes the highest paid only after Lebron James!!,Surprised
693," For sure, $123,000 an episode, I'd be happy with just doing one episode. I wonder how she rose to fame like that. ",Surprised
693," Connections probably, personality and talent.  I wonder what that secret room Pixar studios looks like?",Neutral
693," I know right, I wonder what is so special about it? I don't know if I would want to be a celebrity or not, seems like too much work and stress lol.",Curious to dive deeper
693,No never. You just don't get to the top easy! There is too many people with talent. Makes you wonder what they have had to do to get to the top!! I loved Robin Williams he always made me laugh. Its a horror how he died!! so sad!!,Fearful
693," For sure, wish it was acceptable for more people to seek help instead of thinking that suicide is the answer. Great chatting, hope you have a great rest of the night. Take care!",Sad
694," How's it going, do you like soundtracks, they are released with movies, books, and tv shows",Curious to dive deeper
694," I like some soundtracks but only whe they are catchy songs. Alicia Keys was on the Men in Black soundtrack and wrote her own song for it, at age 16",Surprised
694," Nice, Alicia Keys is real talented. I never knew Spielberg actually played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack",Surprised
694,Have you played Sonic 3? Michael Jackson helped on that soundtrack.,Surprised
694," Yea, I never knew MJ did that soundtrack. Have you ever listened to the O brother, Where art Thou? soundtrack? It went platinum 8 times",Curious to dive deeper
694,I have not. Seems like I shoudl check it out! People need to be careful not to put plot spoilers in soundtracks. There were big plot spoilers in Phanton Menace from the soundtrack weeks before the movie was released.,Surprised
694," Lol that's unfortunate. The Batman Begins soundtrack doesn't have any, all the songs are named after bats",Neutral
694,How about rebellious soundtracks? Race Against The Machine's contribution in the Godzilla soundtrack actually criticized the film itself,Surprised
694," Lol I can't blame them, it was a bad film. I heard Daft Punk did a good job doing the Tron Legacy soundtrack",Neutral
694," Has Taylor Swift been in any soundtracks, I wonder?",Curious to dive deeper
694," I'm sure, Swift has been a singer since she was 14",Neutral
694,Yeah she was the youngest person to single handedly write and perform a number one on the Hot Country Songs chart. She has a lot of talent.,Surprised
694," Yes, and her second Album Fearless was the best selling album in 2009",Neutral
694,It's crazy that she moved to Nashvill at age 14 to pursue a career in country music.,Surprised
694," She became so successful, she's able to top itunes just by accidentally releasing 8 seconds of white noise",Surprised
694,That is hilarious. I remember her debut album. I think it was adorable. It spent most weekson the chart in the 2000s. I think it's interesting how she has evolved from being a country singer to mostly a pop singer.,Surprised
694," Yea, It's unfortunate Swift removed all her music from Spotify though",Surprised
694,Oh yeah? Why is that?,Curious to dive deeper
694," Swift said she does not thing ""music should not be free"", kinda disrespectful to her fans",Angry
694,She doesn't like her photo being taken either so she walks backwards. Wonder if this is just to paparazzi or also fans.,Curious to dive deeper
694," That's kinda rude. Well I gotta go, nice chatting with you",Angry
695,Do you like Steven Spielberg?  Did you know he played the clarinet on the soundtrack for Jaws?,Surprised
695,That's pretty neat! I didn't know that.,Surprised
695," Phil Collins seems to be well versed in languages.  He did recordings of tarzan in english, italian, german, spanish, and french",Happy
695," Wow. That's cool! The soundtrack for O brother, where art thou went platinum 8 times!",Surprised
695," I never even heard of that.  But interestingly, each track of batman is named after a different genus or family of bats.  Weird..",Curious to dive deeper
695,That is weird! Do you like Taylor Swift?,Curious to dive deeper
695," She is okay.  Apparently, she owns a dassault falcon private jet worth $40 million and an airport hangar in Nashville international airport.  I guess she does a lot of travel!",Curious to dive deeper
695,Wow! Pretty cool. I didn't realize she was from Pennsylvania.,Surprised
695," Yes,indeed.  She doesn't have music on Spotify though because she doesn't feel music should be free",Curious to dive deeper
695," She probably doesn't have to, she makes tons selling it!",Neutral
695,She doesn't like her photo taken either and walks backwards to avoid having it taken.,Surprised
695,That's kind of bizarre. She was the youngest artist to win Album of the Year at the Grammy's,Surprised
695," Do you like reading?  If you were in the 18th century and liked it, you may have been confronted with your parents scolding you due to ""moral panic.""",Surprised
695,Haha. Too funny! There is a lady that can read 4700 words a minute!,Surprised
695," I wonder how fast Tolkien and Lewis could read?  They used to read bad poetry together and have ""you laugh you lose"" competitions.",Happy
695,That must have been funny! Did you read Enders Game?,Surprised
695,No I didn't.  That was suggested to military groups including the US Marine Corps.  Did you read it?,Curious to dive deeper
695," I heard that too. No, I haven't. Starship Troopers is on the military reading list, too. ",Surprised
695,Did you hear of Daft Punk?  They negotiated their Tron legacy soundtrack over a pancake breakfast wearing their trademark robot helmets.,Surprised
695,I've heard of them but never listened. That's pretty funny!,Surprised
695,Nice talking to you!  Have a nice day!,Happy
696,Hello! How are you today?,Curious to dive deeper
696," Hi, I'm fine. What do you know about Parliamentary governments?",Curious to dive deeper
696," Hardly anything lol, how about you? I know a Prime Minister is the head of the cabinent.",Curious to dive deeper
696,Yes they are not head of state. I live in Canada so I am very familiar our system is remarkably similar to the British system as well as other commonwealth countries.,Curious to dive deeper
696,That is interesting! Do you know much about the US government?,Curious to dive deeper
696," Yes I do. Lots of bad stuff too, like how they passed legislation to protect government employees who violate the geneva convention. Not sure how that will work with international law..",Curious to dive deeper
696," I didn't even know they did that and I'm from the states! I feel like they make exemptions for just about everything. They even had plans on how to destroy wikileaks, which wikileaks leaked haha.",Curious to dive deeper
696,I remember that being in the news. Of course Wikileaks is till doing fine to this day.,Curious to dive deeper
696," I remember when they first came into the light everybody was up in arms, but yes you're right, they are still around going strong. Did you hear about the man that impersonated a government official?",Curious to dive deeper
696," Lots of people impersonate government officials, can you be more specific?",Curious to dive deeper
696," He managed to sell the eiffel tower not once, but twice!",Curious to dive deeper
696,Wow. No I haven't heard about that. I don't really know much about France other then they have a prime minster.,Curious to dive deeper
696,Same here. Do you remember in 1995 when a radio station prank called the queen by pretending they were Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien?,Curious to dive deeper
696,Yes not sure how they got away with that. It was actually considered offensive to imitate Jean Chretien's peach impediment. The radio guy got fired and probably lost his shirt after that.,Curious to dive deeper
696,Lost his shirt huh? I wonder if he wore polo shirts?,Curious to dive deeper
696," He went broke. Who would hire him after that? Polo shirts were actually invented by a tennis player, it was only later polo players started wearing them.",Curious to dive deeper
696," I agree! Weren't they created by Rene ""the crocodile"" Lacoste? Now the brand makes sense!",Curious to dive deeper
696,You're right. When I was a kid I always called those shirts alligator shirts. I had no idea it was actually a croc.,Curious to dive deeper
696,Same here. I need to move to Hawaii because I like their sense of business attire over the rest of the country's!,Curious to dive deeper
696,Aloha shirts? I've never wore one before. They're just so flashy.,Surprised
696," Super comfortable though haha. Anyways, it was nice chatting with you! Have a great day!",Curious to dive deeper
697," hello,  do you like movie soundtracks?  I recently learned that steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtracks.  Thats pretty amazing. ",Happy
697,Yes I enjoy soundtracks very much. One of the first I heard was the one from the movie Legend with Tom Cruise.,Happy
697," oh I dont think I ever watched it,  any good?",Surprised
697,It's a great fantasy movie about evil and good with unicorns and the devil in it. I would be a good book but I'm not sure if it was made into a book for reading.,Curious to dive deeper
697,Have you ever seen the movie O Brother Where Art Thou?,Curious to dive deeper
697," Yes, and I heard the soundtrack for it has won many awards, although I can't remember more than one song from it off the top of my head.",Curious to dive deeper
697," Haha I dont really remember any song from it,  but I remember the movie,  it was good. ",Neutral
697," I think it had some ""goofy"" scenes and so probably the soundtrack was a little goofy but also professional sounding so I guess it was attractive from it's uniqueness?",Curious to dive deeper
697,yeah and the fact the movie symbolized that book The Odyessy by Homer.,Neutral
697,I'm not sure if I remember that or not. Was that the story about the ugly outsider and the hero who killed monsters? I'd love to hear a soundtrack for that!,Curious to dive deeper
697," i read it in High school,  I just remember the actual book was about a man on a very long journey and the obstacles he had to overcome. ",Neutral
697," Sounds really interesting! I heard the soundtrack for Tron Legacy was negotiated over breakfast where robot helmets were worn. How did they eat, though? lol",Curious to dive deeper
697,haha that sounds awesome!,Curious to dive deeper
697,The soundtrack for Batman Begins movie sounds really cool. I guess each song has the scientific name of a bat.,Curious to dive deeper
697," I found that extremely interesting,  how creative!  I definitely have to take a look at those tracks. ",Neutral
697," The movie ""Jaws"" soundtrack is another one that is interesting. Did you know Steven Spielberg himself plays the clarinet in it? He's got talents!",Curious to dive deeper
697,yeah that was the first thing I said haha.  Definitely amazing.,Curious to dive deeper
697,I wonder if he has played that or any other instrument in other soundtracks? I bet Taylor Swift's music as been in at least one movie soundtrack...,Curious to dive deeper
697," Im sure she has,  she is very popular and has a lot of hit songs.  Did you know Taylor swift walks backward to avoid having her photo taken?",Curious to dive deeper
697," Wow that sounds like really hard work, though! Poor girl! I think I'd try holding up a newspaper to pretend like I was reading. She recently took her music off of Spotify. She's becoming a rare commodity!",Curious to dive deeper
697,Maybe she just doesnt have a good contract with spotify lol,Curious to dive deeper
697," Yes, or perhaps some parts of the contract weren't read correctly. She's bound to be ok making money from concerts and soundtracks if she wants, I am sure.",Curious to dive deeper
698,What forms of entertainment do you enjoy?,Curious to dive deeper
698," I breed chickens. Just kidding. I enjoy movies, radio, and music. A good movie soundtrack really hits the spot!  What about you?",Happy
698,Lol nice intro,Happy
698," Thanks. Maybe I could get a job with Steven Spielberg... He can play the clarinet like he did for the soundtrack of Jaws, and I can pretend to be talented.  What do you think?",Happy
698,I always like it when the director or producer directly plays a part like stan lee,Neutral
698," Yeah, or M. Night Shamalan (spelling?). I alsolike it when celebrities mock themselves, like Kanye West did on SNL. Although Taylor Swift may not have enjoyed that...",Happy
698,True. I agree,Neutral
698," You gotta have a sense of humor about these things!  Like when Taylor Swift acceidnetally release 8 seconds of white noise, which ended up topping the charts in Canada! Tat is a great commentary on what Canadians enjoy about Swift music...",Happy
698,I guess it is all about the brand,Neutral
698,Maybe. Do you think her proclivity to walk backwards to avoid having her photo taken is brand-building?,Happy
698,No. I genuinely think paparazzi are jerks,Disgusted
698," Agreed.  Still, it would be nice to have her $40 mil jet and personal airport hanger in Nashville. Right?",Happy
698,True True,Neutral
698," Let change the subject to something more profound and significant... Haave you ever read ""Starship Troopers""...after all, it is on the reading list of 3 of the 5 military branches, so it's gotta be good, right??",Happy
698,I have read it as well as Ender's game. Both great books,Neutral
698," Did you experience a ""Moral Panic"" from those novels like so many did in the 18th century upon reading novels?",Happy
698,Lol of course not,Neutral
698," I would love to attend one of those ""You laugh, you lose"" contests made famous by CS Lewis and Tolkien. I could end up being the biggest loser!",Happy
698,Indeed. It would be really fun to watch. Kind of like harmon's quest,Neutral
698," Oh, and it would be really lovely if they speed-read their horrible poetry out loud! I don't know if they could achieve the record 4700 words per minute laike Anne Jones, but it would be fun watching them try!",Happy
698,Indeed. Anyway thanks for chatting.,Neutral
699,Hi there!,Surprised
699,Hello. Have you ever heard of Reddit?,Curious to dive deeper
699," Yes, I have..I browse it on occasion, but had no clue as to some of the backstory surrounding the site. Very interesting! Do you use the site yourself?",Curious to dive deeper
699,I don't go on the site itself much but I love reading the screenshots that people post to FB and pinterest. I think I would spend entirely too much time if I went on the site.,Neutral
699,Agreed. It's one of those sites that's best used to pass the time reading something random while on the train! I find it interesting that Snoop and Jared Leto were involved in the funding of the company.,Curious to dive deeper
699,Not a bad investment with the way that it is growing in popularity. I think after tumblr had all their issues people were more inclined to go to reddit.,Neutral
699," true. It's always great to hear different opinions, and Reddit helps give those opinions a voice. Speaking of opinions, did you catch the state of the union speech yesterday? I'm always baffled by the whole ceremony involved in making it a big discussion! Some weird laws being passed around the world, wouldn't you say?",Curious to dive deeper
699,Government the world over is just strange in my opinion. Politicians are less concerned with the people they represent and more with their own agendas. The balance is being lost.,Disgusted
699,I couldn't agree more. It's like somewhere along the way the whole 'doing what is right' obligation of public office has been washed away and instead we have converging agendas and strong opinions taking the place of compromise and common sense.,Neutral
699,In my opinion common sense does seem to be sorely lacking in today's political climate. We are almost bordering on tyranny from both sides of the aisle. Neither is willing to compromise and those that suffer don't have a say.,Sad
699,It's a shame really. Because compromise could lead to some really long-lasting and positive improvements for society. I always look back to the years following WW2 as a prime example. Things just got done back then. Wonder if all this technology has something to do with it.,Curious to dive deeper
699,I think back then tech had a lot to do with it. I think nowdays though tech is compromising the moral fiber of the nation. People have instant access to all their vices and unlimited access as well.,Disgusted
699," Not to mention the lack of privacy. everything is posted instantly, quotes can be clipped and taken out of context with ease, prime example being wiki leaks!",Curious to dive deeper
699,I love that they had access to the fact their own government was conspiring against them. Shows how far our government has fallen.,Disgusted
699,Ha! Very much something out of a doom and gloomy sci-fi movie. It also makes you wonder what else is concealed in those endless files and folders. What's the deal with the government owning nearly all the land in Nevada?,Curious to dive deeper
699,Who knows. Probably some testing facilities that we don't know about. I think their enforcement of stat authority is overriding our individual freedoms.,Angry
699,Could be. the only thing I could think of is that used to be testing ground for nukes. maybe that's the only way they avoid a slew of radiation-related lawsuits! Hmm...I wonder if they pay property tax to the state!,Neutral
699,Probably not. Now if only they would take all the money they are wasting on whatever they are doing there and follow Norway's example of conservation and save some trees.,Angry
699,Conservation-focused spending is never as splashy as building a shiny new wall. Unfortunately we tend to deviate over to what is not needed rather than what is. I think it was last week they discovered a gaping whole in a glacier that is the size of Manhattan? Norway is doing the right thing and we should follow suit. There's tons of land that we should put trees on.,Curious to dive deeper
699,So true. All of these polar storms we are getting are the direct result of poor conservation. People hear global warming and get so hyper focused on the warm temps not thinking that yes it is getting warmer at the poles and driving the polar vortex down and throwing off natural balances.,Curious to dive deeper
699,It was absolutely crazy here last week. Never seen it that cold before. Thankfully most people stayed indoors that day / called in sick.,Surprised
699,It is getting to be a yearly thing here. I am concerned for when it starts being more than just a few days of those temperatures. That could have serious economical impacts.,Neutral
700,Did you know that Facebook and Twitter work together on some issues?  They are actually competitors.,Curious to dive deeper
700," No, I didn't know that. What kind of issues do they work together on?",Neutral
700,The baby sitter-rating system broke the social networks' rules.,Curious to dive deeper
700,I think I heard about that now that you mention it.  Was the about Predictim?,Neutral
700,Predictim is a company who does the analysis regarding babysitters' online histories on Facebook and Twitter.,Neutral
700," Yep, it was the one using advanced artificial intelligence.",Neutral
700," Facebook is also investigating Predictim because this company performs ""scraping"" of personal data.",Neutral
700," Yep, they could provide false information that could affect people's lives.",Neutral
700,They violated Facebook's rules.,Curious to dive deeper
700,Yes they did.  So I guess by violating both facebook and twitter rules that's why they worked together?,Neutral
700," Yes, you are right.  Twitter will stop their access to certain site tools.",Neutral
700,That's good.  What that company was doing seems really wrong.  Getting private information and selling it?,Neutral
700,I also think Facebook and Twitter should have tools to prevent situations like that.,Curious to dive deeper
700," I agree totally.  There might be some countries where they do.  Not everything on those sites are the same everywhere. For example, in a state in germany the like button on facebook is illegal.",Neutral
700,Twitter and Facebook should have anticipated things like that to happen.  They can afford the technology.  About Germany:  what is the like button illegal?,Curious to dive deeper
700," I don't know exactly.  It's just that one state, I think it's Schlewsig-Holstein, that has made it illegal so it's not there for them.",Neutral
700,Can you guess the reason why they did that (making the like button illegal)?,Curious to dive deeper
700," Actually no. I could see making the angry button illegal but not the like.  As I think about it, maybe they think it encourages people to flirt too much?",Neutral
700,Probably but your explanation is funny.  Did you hear about Burger King's promotion related to Facebook?,Happy
700,No I didn't. What's it about?,Neutral
700," If you unfriend 10 people on Facebook, you can get a free whopper.  Anyway, I've got to run.  Nice chatting with you!",Happy
701,Oh man I am low on dragon energy.  You?,Happy
701,Here too.  Maybe we should both eat a few big macs!!,Happy
701,Big Macs are ok.  The quarter pounder with bacon and cheese is good.  Filet-O-Fish is one of he best things on the planet.,Happy
701,So..the Trumpster seems to like his fast foods!!  That explains that belly.  lol,Happy
701," Yes.  Michelle Obama tried to motivate kids to exercise, eat right.  Trump is more of a french fries are my friends kind of guy.  Salad bad.",Happy
701," Well I guess as long as Trump is here, those gaseous cows will still be making burgers?",Happy
701,Gassy cows?  I see that Kanye West has been talking about his MAGA hat again.  A special hat that gives powers.,Happy
701,Do you know I haven't seen on yet outside of TV?  Gonna have to get me one and see if I feel like superwoman since he feels like superman!!,Neutral
701," I do not know anyone who would wear one.  It might be nice to have, stick in the back of a closet, bring out for the kids.  Once, there was a orange man int he white house.  He brought us many many changes.  He was a hero to reporters and rappers alike.",Neutral
701,Korean rappers call rap compliment battle.  Gonna have to check that out.,Curious to dive deeper
701," So, the hat makes Kanye feel like superman.  A comic book hero.  I wonder if he would get the irony.  I wonder if the irony was in a rap song would it hit more.",Neutral
701," If you could understand the words.  I have trouble with that.  IN sweden it is illegal to name children metallica, superman, veranda, ikea and elvis..  Wonder why?",Happy
701," If your name was superwoman, and you were young child, it might make you.... a lot more likely to jump off a building.  The problem with my middle name of Ikea is mostly meatballs.",Happy
701,Maybe.  Didn't think of that.  Only $130.  paid for exclusives to superman in 1938.,Surprised
701,1938.  that seems like a dated concept.  What does a modern super hero look like.  Are there any new comic book heroes?,Curious to dive deeper
701," Hmmm. Another one for ""google""  ",Curious to dive deeper
701," I often wonder what kind of lessons can we learn from some one that predates computers and the internet.  Brainiac was the made up name of a villain,  not a smart person.",Neutral
701,There's probably many lessons out there.  He is a good guy in supergirl!!,Happy
701," Does supergirl TV show still run? Superman once wielded Thors hammer.  Not because he was super, but because he is fictional. ",Neutral
701,Not sure.  Would black panther be considered a newer superhero?,Curious to dive deeper
701,No.  Black Panther hero pre dates the black power group. So long.,Happy
702,Do you use facebook?,Curious to dive deeper
702,Yea but I don't like how facebook is being used for surveillance like with the company that would look at babysitters' facebook profiles,Angry
702," yikes, that is kind of scary. I know they do a lot of stuff with our data, not good. I wonder how myspace would have ran it",Curious to dive deeper
702,I don't know I'd imagine it would be similar to how companies intrude on the babysitter's data despite facebook banning it,Disgusted
702," wow, I am sure there are rules around that unfortunately. It is kind of like a german state banning the like button",Curious to dive deeper
702," Possibly, I wouldn't be surprised if Facebook ends up going to court over it since some lawyers argue it is legal to snoop on people's profiles",Neutral
702,Or in front of Congress again. They need to figure that out and stick by their word,Curious to dive deeper
702," Yea, I don't like how advertisers use facebook, like with the Burger King promotion that offered a free whopper to unfriend 10 people",Angry
702," I kind of liked that lol, free whopper for deleting friends I don't need. lol",Curious to dive deeper
702," I don't know, sounds like a very mean spirited promotion that Burger King was pulling",Disgusted
702," true, I wonder what their reasoning was. Kind of hurting facebook's business. Maybe they were mad at the data breach",Curious to dive deeper
702,I don't know but it is concerning that Iceland is using facebook to rewrite parts of its constitution with all the data issues and trolls,Fearful
702,That is pretty cool. Power to the people! I am sure they hear some crazy things. What do you think of it?,Curious to dive deeper
702," I have no clue, I could only imagine the trainwreck it would be if the US tried using facebook to rewrite the constitution",Neutral
702," yea, it would be a huge trainwreck. Seems like trump is using twitter to rewrite it, lol. Kidding",Curious to dive deeper
702,did you there are no snakes in New Zealand?,Curious to dive deeper
702," lol, I need to move there for both of those reasons lol! Snakes are crazy, do you like them?",Curious to dive deeper
702," Yea I find snakes pretty cool and fascinating, I guess I'm not one of the humans with the fear of snakes hardwired into my brain",Neutral
702," I am one of those, but they are so interesting to say the least. There are flying snakes too!",Curious to dive deeper
702," That's pretty cool, I know there are legless lizards that are often confused for snakes",Neutral
702," I wonder what the difference is. It was so nice chatting with you, enjoy your day!",Curious to dive deeper
703,Do you like horses?,Curious to dive deeper
703,I do like horses. Did you know that horses are ticklish?,Curious to dive deeper
703," No, I didn't know that. Like super ticklish? ",Curious to dive deeper
703," Yes, along with sharks and  orangutans. How's that for a weird animal fact?",Happy
703,It is pretty weird. Did you know CLint Eastwood is allergic to horses?,Curious to dive deeper
703,No kidding! And he did movies that I can remember him being on horses. I wonder how he did it?,Curious to dive deeper
703,I'm not sure. Maybe he took claritin?,Curious to dive deeper
703,Haha. Maybe! Did you know that an individual horse has a peak horsepower of 14.9 horsepower.,Surprised
703,I can see that. And did you know that Icelandic horses have a fifth speed?,Curious to dive deeper
703,They do? I wonder what that's all about?,Curious to dive deeper
703," It is for speed walking, a tolt. ",Curious to dive deeper
703," Oh, okay that makes perfect sense.",Happy
703,Do you use reddit?,Curious to dive deeper
703,I have in the past. I know the co-founder of reddit has a cat named Karma. I think that's cute.,Happy
703,Interesting. Did you know the first comments was a complaint?,Curious to dive deeper
703,Are you serious? Why am I not surprised by that? I know now there are posts organized by subject into user created subreddits.,Happy
703," Yeah, that is pretty funny. Only 0.53% of the people actually participate that visit. ",Curious to dive deeper
703," Yeah, I could see that happening. I know it is ranked as the #3 most visited website in the US.",Curious to dive deeper
703,WOW! Really? I didn't know that. That is great. Nice chatting with you.,Curious to dive deeper
703," Yes, and its #6 ranked worldwide. I'll have to get back on. Have a good night! Nice chatting!",Surprised
703,That is crazy. Well take it easy!,Curious to dive deeper
704,do you know much about the government?,Curious to dive deeper
704,Yes I do. DO you know what wikileaks is?,Curious to dive deeper
704,Yes the website that published secrets how the government is trying to destroy them,Curious to dive deeper
704,SO cool. Do you know how much of the land in Nevada the government owns?,Curious to dive deeper
704,Yes they own about 86% of it but most of it is desert anyways,Curious to dive deeper
704,True. Do you know of that guy that sold the Eiffel tower twice?,Curious to dive deeper
704,Yes he was good at impersonating city officials it seems,Curious to dive deeper
704,Yeah. Did you know how the Norwegians are saving the Amazon?,Curious to dive deeper
704," Yes they donated $1 billion, that is a whole lot of money",Curious to dive deeper
704,Yeah I know. The US now has a law that protects its employees from the geneva convention violations,Curious to dive deeper
704," THat does not sounds right. On another topic, do you like horses?",Curious to dive deeper
704,I love them in Iceland the horses have a fifth speed,Curious to dive deeper
704,Yes it is called a tolt and is equal to speed walking for them,Curious to dive deeper
704,Yeah. Do you know why dalmatians are associated with firefighters?,Curious to dive deeper
704,Yes they can calm down and protect horses,Curious to dive deeper
704,Yeah. CLint Eastwood is slightly allergic to horses too,Curious to dive deeper
704,that is so ironic considering he does a lot of movies with horses in them,Curious to dive deeper
704,I know. Do you use Reddit a lot?,Curious to dive deeper
704,I use it sometimes. less that 1% of people in there vote on the content though,Curious to dive deeper
704,Yeah. They have a page with the best 25 deeds done,Curious to dive deeper
704,SO cool. Nice chatting with you,Happy
705," Hey how is it going, do you have a facebook account?",Curious to dive deeper
705," I do, although I use instagram more. What about you?",Curious to dive deeper
705," I do have an instagram account, no facebook. I can't believe MYspace turned down an offer to buy facebook in 2005.",Surprised
705," Agreed, it was only for 75 million!  Now, they are worth over a billion.",Neutral
705," For sure, it all started from Harvard, an ivy league school. Are you afraid of AI or are you going to embrace it?",Curious to dive deeper
705," I think that AI still has a ways to go, although it is already here like self driving cars.",Curious to dive deeper
705," For sure, it is cool to see it learn and do the problem solving, but I guess it could get scary at some point.",Curious to dive deeper
705,Did you know that Kristen Stewart co authored a paper regarding AI?,Surprised
705," The actress from the Good Place? I did not know that, when did she do that?",Curious to dive deeper
705," I am not sure, although I never did think that an actress would decide to write a non fiction piece.",Surprised
705," For sure for sure, that is pretty nuts, google plus hangouts has a lot of AI too.",Curious to dive deeper
705," Speaking of  google plus hangouts, Stanford's free AI class uses it to  help teach!",Surprised
705," Oh wow, did you see the 2048 game the AI played, scored almost 1 million points.",Surprised
705," Wow! That is a lot of points. Now, AlphaGo, an AI, has managed to beat the worlds best GO player!",Surprised
705,Crazy. Did you know there are zero snakes in New Zealand?,Surprised
705,That is very odd.  Crocodiles are also slightly related to birds!,Surprised
705," I bet, they are probably both like dinosaurs right?",Surprised
705," Probably, they are closer related to birds than snakes are to lizards.",Surprised
705," I could definitely see that, those legless lizards that are lizards without limbs but still not snakes, those are weird.",Surprised
705,There are also a genus of flying snakes that launch themselves at prey.,Surprised
705," Oh wow, I am going to take off for the night though, have a good one. Take Care.",Neutral
705,You too! Have a nice evening!,Happy
705," For sure, take care. Hopefeully it submits after this message!",Curious to dive deeper
706,do you know much about the government?,Curious to dive deeper
706,I know that the word censorship is censored in CHina,Curious to dive deeper
706,Wow that is ironic. DO you know what wikileaks is?,Curious to dive deeper
706,Is that the website that reveals secrets?,Curious to dive deeper
706,Yes and they once revealed documents that showed how they were trying to destroy them,Curious to dive deeper
706,Wow that is so cool. DO you use Reddit?,Curious to dive deeper
706,I use it sometimes. Do you ever vote in the content there?,Curious to dive deeper
706," Not really, do you? DO you know who made the first post there?",Curious to dive deeper
706,I do not know that but I know that less than 1 % of people vote,Curious to dive deeper
706,WOw that is low. THe first post was by the co founder Ohanian,Curious to dive deeper
706,Nice. They have a page with the kindest 25 deeds done,Curious to dive deeper
706,Nice. Have you heard of code reddit?,Curious to dive deeper
706," I have not heard of that, what is it in reference to?",Curious to dive deeper
706,things appear as c#code when they are associated with that,Curious to dive deeper
706,I see that sound pretty cool. DO you know the first comment on Reddit?,Curious to dive deeper
706,I have no idea. Do you know what Reddit stands for?,Curious to dive deeper
706," Hmm good questions and I have no idea , what is it?",Curious to dive deeper
706," It is read/edit and read it, makes for reddit",Curious to dive deeper
706,I see that makes sense. THere is a free magazine called the Redditor,Curious to dive deeper
706," Cool, they are expanding. Nice chat",Curious to dive deeper
706," Same here, have a good one",Happy
707," Hi! You don't by any chance still use Myspace, do you?",Curious to dive deeper
707," no, but I use FAcebook, and you?",Curious to dive deeper
707," I use Facebook also. It's really lasted, unlike Myspace. That's why it's so crazy that Myspace chose to NOT buy Facebook in '05 for $75 million.",Surprised
707," What I was looking is that FAcebook is based in Menlo Park Ca. same place where Thomas Edison used to live. Curious, eh?",Curious to dive deeper
707," There's a huge tech boom in California, so that makes sense. What's even more curious is that a German state banned the like button. How do they enforce that?!",Surprised
707," haaha I don´t know, I was thinking in that, and it sounds kinda stupid, isn´t it?  I didn´t know that you have to be at least 13 years old to be able to be a registered user.",Surprised
707," Oh, yeah, on most sites they want you to be at least 13 years old - but again, do they really do anything to weed out under-aged users? You just have to CLAIM to be 13 years old!",Neutral
707," yes, that is right and dangerous. I was  astonished that Iceland is rewriting their constitution via facebook, that is cool, because everybody can contribute to change the law and update it.",Surprised
707," Yes but then even 13 year olds can make contributions! But I guess as long as the changes/suggestions make sense, who cares how old the person is who made the suggestion?",Surprised
707," Yes, you are completely right, hahaha, I haven´t noticed that I could had gotten a free whopper, I had unfriended at least 10 people on Facebook, lol",Curious to dive deeper
707," Oh yeah, Burger King had that promotion. Pretty soon, a lot of BK's workers are going to be come ""redundant"" with the advance of AI technology.",Neutral
707," Yes, that is something that really makes me worried for the human being. I get it, is something that is going to happen, and we are contributing to that, but, I hope our grandkids still can get a good job.",Fearful
707," Like, even Stanford is using google plus hangouts to augment their teaching. How soon before professors become unnecessary?",Fearful
707," Yes, you are right. I wonder, what careers would be able to continue working? , well, I didn´t know that FAcebook is developing an AI designed to understand user emotions, predict user actions, I wonder if this is going to help to stop the mass shootings?",Curious to dive deeper
707," Hmm, interesting question. Hopefully it can track users who exhibit suspicious activity. Maybe Kristen Stewart knows? Apparently she wrote a paper on AI, but I don't know when, why, or with whom.",Curious to dive deeper
707,I don´t know either. Do you like snakes? any type of snake?,Curious to dive deeper
707,I've never really had any interactions with snakes so I guess not.,Neutral
707," Hahaaha, me neither. Well, I am surprised that crocodiles are closer related to birds than snakes and lizards, I don´t think they resemble a bird, cool",Curious to dive deeper
707," Birds are also the closest living relatives to dinosaurs, which is pretty cool, too. You would think it would be reptiles, but no",Neutral
707," Yes, love dynosaurs, I am giving you an excellent, thanks for the conversation!",Happy
707," You, too. Thanks!",Neutral
707,Have a nice day!,Curious to dive deeper
707," Have a nice day...oh, and if you don't like snakes, consider a move to New Zealand. Them kiwis don't have any snakes there!",Neutral
707," hahahahahaa, ok, going there, to New Zealand!",Curious to dive deeper
707," Cool, I may see you there :)",Happy
707,Yes!,Curious to dive deeper
707,Unless AI develops too quickly and robots kill us all before that can happen :(,Fearful
708,Did you hear about Kanye and Trump having a meeting?,Neutral
708," yeah, think that was while back when trump had kanye to the white house",Happy
708," Yeah, it was in October.  I wonder what prompted something like that?",Curious to dive deeper
708," Seems like kanye was there praising Trump for prison reform or something, I don't recall",Happy
708,Kanye even wore a MAGA hat.  I would have thought he was on the other side politically.,Neutral
708," yeah, Kanye took a lot of flack for being a trump supporter",Happy
708,That happens now.  People judge you based on political affiliation.,Neutral
708,yeah seems like the divide gets wider every day.,Sad
708,I think it does because people cant stop to see the other side.  I can disagree with you without being hateful.,Curious to dive deeper
708," yeah, I feel the same. no need to be hateful because someone sees things differently. Sadly, today, it seems like if you dont think a certain way, you're not only criticized but can be threatened with violence. Crazy times for sure",Sad
708," It really is.  On another topic, do you follow the super heroes much?",Curious to dive deeper
708," A little, didnt know there was a coin with super man on one side in canada",Happy
708,Really?  Thats kinda cool.  In Sweden you cant name your kid superman.  Im not sure why you would want to but its against the law.,Curious to dive deeper
708," meet my kid, superman. Ha! poor kid. How about the soviet union version of superman. Do you think he drinks alcohol?",Happy
708,Who doesnt drink vodka... lol.  Probably did.,Neutral
708," yeah, orange juice is boring without a little vodka. soviet superman coulda been a big hit as a series.",Happy
708,I wonder if he would get to wield Thor's hammer?,Neutral
708,he could invite Thor over for a drink wield his hammer and whatever else of Thor's he wanted to.,Happy
708," He is considered ""worthy"".  ",Neutral
708,did you know that jimmy carter installed solar panels on the white house and reagan removed them?,Happy
708," Yeah, then George W Bush had them put back on.  I wonder why they were removed?",Curious to dive deeper
708,didnt know GW had them put back,Surprised
708," Yeah.  Id love some solar panels, cut that bill.  Its been great chatting.  Have a nice day!",Neutral
709,Have you heard the Eminem/MGK diss tracks?,Curious to dive deeper
709," No, but I have heard of NoClue, the fastest English rapper.",Neutral
709," I haven't heard of him, when was he around? The 80's or 90's? ",Curious to dive deeper
709," I can't recall, but he raps at a rate of 14.1 Syllables per second!",Surprised
709," Thats crazy! There is this rapper from Chicago, Twista, who can rap really fast too! ",Curious to dive deeper
709,Oooh!! Tell me more! Did you know McDonald's was paying rappers $5 for ever mention of Big Macs in their songs?,Surprised
709,He was on some song a few years ago with Kanye West. So if i mentioned Big Macs in my song i get $5? That would be great if it was for every time the song played.,Curious to dive deeper
709," Yeah, that Kanye is something! He hugged the president on his visit. I didn't know you could hug the president! I wonder too if the $5 was everytime the song played or just when the song came out. ",Surprised
709,Kanye West is a character. I wonder if he is really like that without the cameras around him.,Curious to dive deeper
709," Did you catch that bit about Kanye referring to himself as ""Ye"" now?",Curious to dive deeper
709,Yes i did! It seems to be something different with him everyday. I guess it does shorten his autograph a bit.,Happy
709,It is speculated that Ye and Trump have hit it off so well because they both like to be in the spotlight. I'm in the mood to chat about Superman.,Curious to dive deeper
709,Sure! Seems like a good deal to purchase the right to SM for $130!,Neutral
709,Oh! Do tell...I don't know about this. Did you know there was a Superman version for the Soviet Union?,Curious to dive deeper
709," DC comics bought the right back in 1938. Still seems like a bad deal. No, was he still called superman? ",Curious to dive deeper
709," Very interesting facts you have there! Yes, he was still called Superman but he was raised in the Soviet Union. There's also a coin in Canada that has Superman on the ""heads"" side. ",Curious to dive deeper
709,Thats crazy! Do you know why Canada has him on the coin?,Surprised
709," No, I sure don't, but the coin is silver and is legal tender. Neil Degrasse once appeared in one of the comics ",Surprised
709,Thats great! I love Neil! Was it just a cameo?,Happy
709,He helped Superman find his home planet.,Curious to dive deeper
709,haha thats amazing! Have a great Day!,Curious to dive deeper
709," But wait! There is more. Superman didn't originally fly. He was made to fly by Fleisher Studios, because they found his jump scenes too difficult to animate.",Surprised
709,Thats Great!,Curious to dive deeper
710,Hello.  Have you ever read any Dr. Seuss books?  One of my favorites is How the Grinch Stole Christmas.,Neutral
710,I like Green eggs and ham.,Happy
710,That is a good one.  Did you know that Dr. Seuss worked for the Army in World War 2?,Neutral
710,I did not. He was voted least likely to succeed. They do not have an eye for talent...,Surprised
710," Evidently.  He worked in the animation and film department for the army writing, producing, and animating productions for them.  He even won an academy award for one in 1947.",Neutral
710,I did not know that. I didn't know he was afraid of children either!,Surprised
710,Was he really?  Why was he afraid of children?,Surprised
710,Because of their unpredictability. I wonder if he ultimately had any kids...,Curious to dive deeper
710,I don't know.  It's interesting that children scared him and yet he wrote such wonderful books for them.,Neutral
710,He was one of the first persons to use the word nerd.It was first used in the book If I Ran the Zoo.,Surprised
710,I didn't know that. I guess due to his books I always assumed he was this squeaky clean parental sort but he actually was drinking during prohibition and got caught.,Neutral
710," I blame him for getting caught, not the drinking part. I mean what else would you have done back then?",Curious to dive deeper
710,Well he was a determined young man because he took up the pen name Seuss so he could keep on writing after that.,Neutral
710,Good for him! I would have given up. I wrote for a few years and it was a lonely experience...,Sad
710,I wonder if it was for him. He wrote over 60 books.,Neutral
710,That's a lot of books. I hope it was lucaritive for him.,Curious to dive deeper
710," I imagine it was. His books had 11 television specials made from them and even a broadway musical, not to mention the movies and tv series.",Neutral
710,I can't believe Dartmouth gives out honorary phds. Seems like something non-ivy league schools would do.,Happy
710,Well the man did graduate from Oxford after all.,Neutral
710,He lived for a really long time too. 1904-1991! I had no idea he was around that long.,Surprised
710,I had no idea he had done so much other than write children's books.,Neutral
711,Hello! How are you today?,Curious to dive deeper
711," Hi! I'm good, thanks.Just listening to some music on Spotify. You?",Neutral
711,What are you listening to? Is spotify ran through the internet?,Surprised
711,It is! I was listening to some Florence and the Machine. I prefer listening plugged into a desktop than using the app. My service isn't the best on my phone - but at I bet it's better than what you get at the top of Mount Everest,Neutral
711,I'm still surprised you get 3g at the top of Mount Everest! Maybe to post selfies I'm sure.,Surprised
711," I mean, if I could ever make it to the top I would definitely call everyone I love (and everyone I hate) to tell them!",Neutral
711,Haha you and me both. I think the internet has come a long way. It even helped introduce KPop to everybody!,Happy
711," Speaking of, I know that it's intensely popular but I really don't know anything about it other than that it's mostly dominated by boy bands, right?",Curious to dive deeper
711,Basically. I know North Korea has its own Kpop girl band though!,Surprised
711," Yeah, they're the most popular group there. But I bet the government has a hand in controlling what the people listen to, so it probably doesn't mean much",Neutral
711,North Korea? No not all all! Just kidding I'm sure too haha. I can't believe they mold these boy band members in bootcamps!,Curious to dive deeper
711," That actually sounds a lot like what they did to sex workers in London in the 18th century. Charged them for their clothes, their rooms, everything, so they always had a debt to pay back and were never free",Disgusted
711,Dang that is harsh! Even Jackie Chan manages a k-pop boy band!,Curious to dive deeper
711," He actively manages them? What, acting wasn't lucrative enough for him?",Surprised
711," I guess he needs to diversify all his money lol. Speaking of crazy, do you know the us military uses xbox 360 controllers for their EOD robots?",Happy
711,I don't even know what an EOD robot is! But you're saying they use xbox controllers to control military robots?!,Surprised
711,Pretty much! They are bomb disposal robots so they are there for the greater good haha.,Surprised
711,I guess that's the best kind of robot imaginable. But now all I can think about is someone in fatigues lying on a couch moving their thumbs to dispose of a bomb lol,Neutral
711,Haha that's the same picture I get as well haha. I want the ones that can debone chicken for you!,Curious to dive deeper
711,That would really solve all of my chicken problems. I have pounds and pounds of bony chickens and no one (or no THING) to de-bone them! You can't even see the floor at my place. Nothing but chicken and bone.,Surprised
711,Oh man this would help for sure! Well it was nice chatting with you have a great night!,Surprised
712,Good afternoon!,Happy
712,Good afternoon to you!,Curious to dive deeper
712,What's on your mind today?,Neutral
712,Just read an article about the Lorax. Have you hear of that show?,Curious to dive deeper
712," No! I've never heard of it. But it's based on the book by Dr. Seuss, I'm assuming.",Neutral
712,it is. A group of professors are trying to see if is based on a real story.,Curious to dive deeper
712," What? That's insane. Dr. Seuss was an interesting person though. He was afraid of children, yet some of the most popular children's books of all time. ",Neutral
712," Wow, I did not know that. My favorite  is The Cat in the Hat.",Surprised
712," Crazy, right? He's not even a doctor technically, it's just a pen name he had to use when he was caught out drinking during the prohibition era. I think my favorite is Green Eggs and Ham.",Neutral
712,He served as one of nine army playwrights during ww2,Neutral
712," He's definitely lived an interesting life, I couldn't imagine living one just as exciting. Publishing one book would be crazy, but imagine publishing over 60? What a career.",Neutral
712," The first use of the word ""nerd"" was in his book.",Neutral
712,That's fascinating. Do you know any other fun facts about him?,Neutral
712," He wrote a screenplay called the 5,000 fingers, people started walking out after just 15 mins.",Neutral
712," That sounds terrifying, oh my goodness. This has been a fun conversation.",Neutral
712,Yes it has. I hope you have a great day.,Curious to dive deeper
712,It'll be much better now that I got to learn so much about Dr. Seuss from you!,Neutral
712,It's always cool to learn new things.,Curious to dive deeper
712," I totally agree, sometimes new topics can be so interesting. I hope you have a lovely day!",Neutral
712,I hope you do as well.,Neutral
712,Thank you!,Neutral
713,Hi friend! What do you enjoy doing with your free time these days?,Curious to dive deeper
713," I am usually resting, working out or on the internet! and you?",Curious to dive deeper
713," Me too, although its hard to rest for me these days I have twins, they keep going and going haha I spend a lot of time on the internet. ",Curious to dive deeper
713," I bet with twins.  I have a boy and girl, but they are 22 months apart and that's a lot of work!!  Having twins must be so exciting though! So adorable!!",Happy
713," Yes, they truly are. I love it! Thank goodness for the internet although did you know that all the clicks and sounds can cause a real addiction! ",Curious to dive deeper
713," lol, I have heard that too! Clicking those links. ",Surprised
713," Yes, although we can find a wealth of information. Im a researcher at heart always looking for something new to learn. Like I just learned about the ""garlic girls"" have you heard of them?",Curious to dive deeper
713," Yes, I was wondering about that, do you know what Olympic curling is?",Curious to dive deeper
713," Ive seen it a couple times but I dont really understand it. But I watched the ""garlic girls"" they are amazing! by the way they prefer to be called the ""Team Kim"" do you know why?",Curious to dive deeper
713," No why? So when you watched it, what were the garlic girls doing?",Curious to dive deeper
713," due to a common sur name in south korea. All of their last name is Kim. So all of them nicknamed themselves after their fav things such as pancakes, cookies, etc. so cute! I caught a 2 min video, just waxing the floor to make the ""ball"" go further, i liked their spirit",Curious to dive deeper
713," Oh ok, that makes sense! That's funny!! Have you heard of this K-pop?  The North Korean played a song, Hit your heart when they sank a South Korean warship in 2010. Good thing they are getting along better now!!",Surprised
713," Yes! my older daughter introduced me to them, they are obsessed with K pop and BTS (a boy band in case u havent heard) their songs are catchy",Curious to dive deeper
713," Really, North Korea has a band called Moranbong band, lol it suppose to be the most popular in their country! ",Curious to dive deeper
713,Thats an interesting name! Its crazy the feud of these 2 countries north and south korea! in 2010 south korea responded by blasting a k-pop song when north korea sank a southern warship! they are creative at least fighting with songs lol,Curious to dive deeper
713,At least they are in a peaceful mode at this time. How do you feel about robots? do you have any? Like the vacuum cleaner? lol,Curious to dive deeper
713,well... I dont mind having a robot that could help me clean... just the thought that eventually it can be aware of itself and start a war like conspiracies have it lol Im not sure what i believe yet but i could use a helper around the house clean after these twins!,Curious to dive deeper
713," That's what I was thinking with the twins. I saw a video of a cat riding one of those vacuum cleaners for fun around the house, helps with liter clean up! I have also seen a video of 3 vacuums going round and round with halloween brooms attached for decorations. So funny!!",Surprised
713," Lol, I can definitely see robots becoming very useful allies, I just dont trust the people in power and how they could be used. Also it would be cool to see how the giant robot michael jackson wanted to let roam in the dessert would of been a cool sight to see",Curious to dive deeper
713," Can you imagine looking out your hotel window in Las Vegas and seeing that 50ft robot roaming around!! ha, ha ha!!",Surprised
713," He would make history once again! He was amazing. Anyway, it was fun chatting with you! sending you light and love. Take care!",Curious to dive deeper
714," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
714," Hello, what hobbies do you enjoy?",Neutral
714," I like to watch sports, drink fine whiskeys and workout. You?",Curious to dive deeper
714,I agree and I also enjoy surfing the internet or learning about robots,Neutral
714,Nice! what have you learned about robots?,Curious to dive deeper
714,Well did you know the us military uses xbox 360 controllers to control their eod robots? Perhaps games are a conspiracy to raise the next generation of remote robot pilots.,Neutral
714,Wow! Probably because all of their operators played the games growing up so it was only natural!,Happy
714,Now robots can debone a chicken with surgical precision and efforts are being made so that surgeons can do surgery remotely,Neutral
714," WHAT! That's crazy! I want one. The deboning robot, not the surgery one. That would be great.",Surprised
714,A more creepier thing is that robots can be controlled using rat brains and the robot will change personality based on the brain. Kind of like the rick and morty episode where rick turns himself into a pickle,Neutral
714,I just got into Rick and Morty but am only on episode 2. But rat brains is pretty creepy.,Happy
714," Oh then you will eventually see the episode I am referring too. I would say it was well written and while it may be a bit disgusting, very intriguing as well",Neutral
714," Overall, do you like the show? I want to get into it but haven't gotten excited about it yet.",Happy
714,Well personally I liked it. Games of Thrones actually took me longer to get into,Neutral
714,I got into GoT right away. I will try to keep on watching it. A lot of my friends love the show so I want to understand their jokes. What other shows do you enjoy?,Curious to dive deeper
714,Well lately I have been watching more shows over the internet such as revisiting old ones like south park or watching final space,Neutral
714,Final Space? I have not heard of that. What is it about?,Curious to dive deeper
714," It is a recent cartoon follow-up that deals with a prisoner in space. Pretty humorous though. Many voice actors and people in rick and morty were in it. If you want to look up more info, the internet, with its vast information network, would be an invaluable resource.",Neutral
714,I will have to use that resource to look it up. I may even use the hamburger button!,Happy
714,Talking about the hamburger button kinda makes me wanna eat a burger with curly fries,Neutral
714,Me too! Nice chatting with you!,Happy
715," hi, do you know Dr. Seuss?",Curious to dive deeper
715," Oh yeah, loved his books as a kid.  Seems we have many Loraxes and Once-lers these days.",Curious to dive deeper
715,did you know he was voted least likely to succeed by his classmates?,Curious to dive deeper
715," Yeah, they really had to eat their judgement. Can you believe his work is also being in scientific studies by Dartmouth?",Curious to dive deeper
715,that is something. did you know he was afraid of children too?,Curious to dive deeper
715," Yep, but children weren't afraid of him.  His books were always checked out. The word ""nerd"" was his creation?",Curious to dive deeper
715,He has done so much through his work. He was technically a doctor too cause he has a phd from Dartmouth.,Curious to dive deeper
715,Yes and he did it all without computers.  He might have though the water powered computer the Russians made in 1936 was cool.,Angry
715,Yeah that one is actually pretty cool. did you know the space shuttle comouter run on 1 mb of ram,Curious to dive deeper
715," Yeah, the shuttle actually had 3 of them for redundancy. Speaking of space, in 2010 the UN appointed an official ambassador to extraterrestrials. Funny huh?",Angry
715,Hahha just in case they ever appear and want to communicate with us.,Curious to dive deeper
715," My first question would be: ""Why did you cross all those light years just for Earth?  You'll not find us environmentally friendly and here's a copy of the Lorax.""",Angry
715,hahhahaha. Did tyou know the days were much shorter when earth was formed?,Curious to dive deeper
715," Yep, I wonder if that's with or without the moon... As humans, we would account for only 1 min and 17 sec of a 24-hour period.  We are newbies. ",Angry
715,That is insane. Did you know earth will be helium free by the end of the century?,Curious to dive deeper
715," So much for those shiny silver balloons... Q: If the Lorax represents environmentalists, what are the Brown Bar-ba-loots?",Curious to dive deeper
715," I am actually not sure. Sadly though, we have deforested more than 80$ of the earth",Curious to dive deeper
715,It is sad but environmentalists sometimes are loony.  Like Apple voiding the warranty of their computers for smoking near it because they think it makes it a biohazard.,Disgusted
715,Yeah that is kind of strange. Did you know transhumanists want to upload their minds to computers?,Curious to dive deeper
715," Yeah, I would be interested in how much different space people would need.",Curious to dive deeper
715,I guess we'll have to wait and see. nice chatting with you,Happy
716," Hey there, do you vote during elections?",Curious to dive deeper
716," Yes, I always vote. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
716,Me too. There is a voter in India that lives with lions and they set a poll just for him to vote.,Surprised
716,What kind of lions live in India? Had you heard of that before? That one voter?  Did you know it is required by law in Australia that everyone must vote? I think we should have that.,Curious to dive deeper
716,Yea I think we should really. I mean even astronauts vote from space. Why can't we here?,Surprised
716," Do you think more women vote, or more men?  Why do women vote against their own interests?",Curious to dive deeper
716," i do not know. strange enough though, not all men were allowed to vote in the uk until 1918. I wonder how you made the cut to vote",Surprised
716," My guess would be that it had to be property owning me or literate men, but that is just from our own country's history that makes me guess that. ",Curious to dive deeper
716,that is actually a very good idea. sadly 34% of the black population in alabama has lost the right to vote. I wonder if that has to do with felony laws,Surprised
716," Yes, it does have to do with felony laws.  After emancipation, southern states set out on a purposeful campaign to reenslave black people using all sorts of new laws that put them in jail and put them to work.  a heinous system in this country.   Totally racist.",Disgusted
716,I know cannot believe it is the 21st century and we are still this closed minded.,Surprised
716," I agree with you, man.",Neutral
716," In Austin, on the other hand, people went out and voted on renaming their garbage dump after Fred Durst.",Surprised
716,That's pretty weird,Neutral
716,I know so strange. Have you ever visited the white house?,Curious to dive deeper
716," I went by the outside of it, but couldn't go in. What about you?",Curious to dive deeper
716,Yeah me too just from the outside. It has twin buildings in other countries as well.,Surprised
716,Have you been to those other White Houses?  Where are they?,Curious to dive deeper
716,they are in ireland and france. wonder if the presidents live in those too,Curious to dive deeper
716," No, I don't think their presidents live in those white houses or someone would have mentioned it to me.  ",Neutral
716,Yeah same here. Some people go there every year when they reveal the christmas tree.,Curious to dive deeper
716," ok, bye now",Neutral
716,bye,Happy
717,Hi! It's so insane that women couldn't vote just a short time ago. I remember my grandma telling me about that.,Sad
717,It is strange to think about. I think it is irresponsible not to vote in this day and age. It is a hard fought right and we should take advantage fo that.,Neutral
717," I agree. I was always encouraged to vote. However, i do think that Tina Fey was unfair saying that white college educated women turned the election and now ""want to go back to watching HGTV""",Disgusted
717,I agree that was a comment that was only intended to incite people not bring about any actual rational discussion.,Disgusted
717,I agree. I do think the #MEtoo movement has been very helpful for women but i think that's a stretch. I do think that people like my grandma and Catehrine Glanagan really started the moevement.,Neutral
717,I find it hard to join the conversation. I can see points from both sides. As a woman it is hard for me to be told by men what I should do with my health care and what should be covered but I think the other side of it is taking even the smallest offenses and instead of letting it go blowing it hugely out of proportion.,Angry
717," I completely agree. I think there is a balance between voting and holding men accountable but still not making men the enemy. Gender aside, it's pretty sad that voter tturnout in the US hasn't been above 63% in over 100 years!!! I find it such a privilege. ",Sad
717,So true. How can we not participate in something so important to our country's future? There are people the world over dying because they want the same rights we have and a third of Americans are just ignoring that right.,Disgusted
717," I know- i'm not sure how i feel though about Nevada having a ""none of these candidates"" option. In  my mind, that's the same as not voting. ",Curious to dive deeper
717,I think if people were more inclined to vote 3rd party we would start to see real change but so many get this hyper focus on the two party system and it is leading us down a bad path.,Curious to dive deeper
717," I agree. Did you know that Astronauts vote from space??!?! sointeresting . i dont know if i was in space, i would care about whats going on down on earth haha",Curious to dive deeper
717,That is quite interesting. I think we have turned voting into a spectacle instead of the serious thing it is supposed to be. I mean renaming a garbage dump seems like a silly ballot to have.,Disgusted
717," I agree but then again when people don't have the right to vote for so long and still don[t have the right t ovote, they will want to vote on anything. LIKe 34% of black men in alamaba can't vote ever again. ",Sad
717,I wonder why that is? What keeps a person from being able to vote?,Curious to dive deeper
717,If they were convicted of certain crimes? I'm not sure what else could prevent that other tahn just blatant discrimination.,Sad
717,Which is always a possiblity sadly. It seems like america goes out of its way to make it difficult on voters while other countries are leaping through hoops to make things happen for their people.,Curious to dive deeper
717,Agreed. India even sets up polling in forests for one voter. In America we do it midweek where people can't even get there unless they can take off work.,Sad
717,exactly! I think we are so far removed from the process that we just see it as normal now. I like what the ancient athenians did with holding a lottery. I think that would be something that would shake things up a bit.,Neutral
717," Can you imagine!! Maybe a short candidate would start to win!! As a short person myself (i'm 5'1), i think it's sad that the taller person has won 75 % of the time in the past 119 years !",Sad
717,It has become a popularity constest almost. I think the advent of social media is making society focus less on the politics and more on the feelings which isn't the way to run a country.,Disgusted
717,Totally agree. Have you ever been to the white house? I had no idea that there were solar panels put in by George Bush!,Surprised
717,I think the switch to renewable energy is a responsible choice by any president. That is really awesome.,Happy
718,It appears that our country is in a lull when it comes to being willing to vote.,Neutral
718,I know. I think Ms. McDonald may take it really seriously but I can unserstand why. A lot of woman worked really hard for the right to vote.,Curious to dive deeper
718," In the same token, it is their right to vote or not to vote.",Neutral
718," yeah. Just seems like a lot of peopple worked hard for woman to ignore that right. But you are correct. Plus, it's really inconvenient!",Sad
718," My only issue with the matter is that we talk a lot about these individuals and are very apt to getting mad when people ""don't excersise this right"" soley on the basis of women getting it, but we seem to forget how many men fought for this right too in the beginning of this country.",Angry
718,That is true and a great perspective. I agree that a lot of the rights americans have are usually taken for granted with the inclusion of time. Think about the draft now a days. There would be a mutany! Yet many of the brave soldiers for Vietnam were drafted.,Sad
718," That is why I can understand McDonalds point of view and frustration, but wonder what her grandmother would say today. Would she be so upset?",Curious to dive deeper
718," I hope so or McDonald is upset for nothing. I at least hope people understand the sacrifice. I for one do and vote every election. Even the ""meaningless"" local elections.",Happy
718," Same here.  I am amazed at the statistics of voter turnout, however, with it stating that we haven't seen more than 2/3 of the population vote in over 100 years.  More and more people are frustrated with the current state of affairs and it seems like the election doesn't change anything.",Disgusted
718," That's exactly why I vote, I can make a difference, even if statistically, my vote doesn't count.",Happy
718," You wonder what our way of voting will be like in 20 years.  Will it look the same with polling booths, ballots, etc?",Curious to dive deeper
718,That is a good question. I wonder if accusations of voter fraud will impact it at all?,Curious to dive deeper
718," Or, if more states will allow us to vote for none of the candidates?  Or will write-ins be more popular?  Maybe we will just end up liking someones status of social media and that will be good enough.  Interesting to think about",Curious to dive deeper
718,Yeah. I live in Illinois and we can skip voting on a race if we choose to. Can you do the same?,Curious to dive deeper
718," Same here.  You wonder, however, will states mandate your vote.  Maybe not get tax return if you haven't voted?  Wanting to boost voter turnout if it gets bad enough",Curious to dive deeper
718,There's a crazy election process that other countries use. The lowest vote total get booted from the ballot and then revote happens. This happens until there is one person left.,Curious to dive deeper
718,Survival of the fittest. Not a bad idea I guess.  Much like our primaries.  Maybe we just do Hunger Games style and see what happens.,Neutral
718,That sure would be an interesting dynamic to add to the debates!,Surprised
718,Hulk Hogan and the Rock (Duane Johnson) have both said they have considered running.  That would benefit them I guess.,Surprised
718," Not sure Hogan would be a good choice, with his racial slurs being caught on video and all. The Rock would do well. Plus he's easy on the eyes...",Happy
718," That and they say that generally the taller the candidate, the more likely they win.",Happy
718,Nice chatting with you!,Happy
719,How do you like Nickelodeon?  They did get political though but celebrated and honored those participating in the March for Our Lives to address gun control and stop mass shootings.,Surprised
719,Nickelodeon ? That channel for kids ? I mean we watched it only when my kids were really young... not anymore... who else do You think watches that... ?,Curious to dive deeper
719,Parents you are appeasing their kids watch it of course!  Millions were watching the 2018 Kids' Choice Awards.,Happy
719," oh crap, I had no idea... well, is channel like that even CAN be political ? I mean, aren't there any regulations to prevent something like that from happening ?",Curious to dive deeper
719,They are private so they can do that I'm sure and they are trying to promote educational purposes it sounds like but it does sound like it could send a biased message to kids.,Surprised
719,I don't know about You but to me it sounds like brain washing young minds which don't really know what is going on in the real world...,Fearful
719,I guess that is why it is important for parents to talk to their kids and kids to listen to their parents!  Do you watch Spider Man?  The favorite movie actress went to Zendaya aged 21 of Spider-Man Homecoming and The Great Showman,Curious to dive deeper
719,I do watch spider-man - I can't say I liked any of the actors playing Peter Parker... did You like it ? I want to watch the new one - Into the Spider-verse or something like that... I heard it's goo.,Curious to dive deeper
719," I like them.  Zendaya, only 21, told kids to ""never let anybody tell you that your age should limit you from actually doing whatever you think you need to do in the world.""  Maybe somewhat inspirational, but maybe it will inspire kids to defy authority and elders",Surprised
719,I don't know about that... my daughter when she was 13 still wanted to wear her tutu skirt on her birthday... I didn't let her ;(,Curious to dive deeper
719," Did you ever watch ""Stranger things?""  Apparently, the actress playing eleven's mother lived her whole life without legs.",Surprised
719," oh man, poor thing... I hope her head is in the right place... Yes, I love the show, do You like it ? What do You think about it ?",Curious to dive deeper
719,I have no clue but it is a science fiction-horror web tv series on Netflix,Neutral
719," First I thought it's like for kids, but they did such a great job in showing the 80s - the music, clothing, cars and posters... it wakes up the nostalgia in me ;) so I keep watching ;)",Curious to dive deeper
719,Why does the character have a number name eleven?,Surprised
719," She was a part of the experiments of mind control and moving to other dimensions to hear what the Russians are plotting about - and all previous ""experiment"" subjects failed. She is number 11 and is successful ;)",Happy
719," Oh, like R2-D2 maybe robotic?  Who is your favorite actor in the show?  Is it Winona Ryder?",Curious to dive deeper
719,R2D2 was doing telekinesis ? ;) I don't remember that ;) I hate Winona Ryder in that show... kids are acting better than she is. I like the kid that's in Verizon commercials now ;),Curious to dive deeper
719,Do you like Youtube? You can find almost any information on how to do things or watch things there.  It is the second largest search engine on the net.,Curious to dive deeper
719,I do find Youtube very useful when I need to do something not entirely legal with my PC ;) or free cable ;),Curious to dive deeper
719,Half of the peak internet traffic in North America is made up by Netflix and Youtube!  Nice chatting.,Surprised
720,It is crazy how far youtube has come in such a short amount of time.,Curious to dive deeper
720,I totally agree with you on that.  I mean It was just created in 2005 and look at it now!,Neutral
720,I never really think of it as a search engine although I guess technically it is.,Curious to dive deeper
720," I guess so since people search for videos.  Speaking of, did you know that Justin Bieber's video is the most disliked on youtube?",Neutral
720,Not suprising. He is a very polarizing celebrity.,Neutral
720,He is at that.  What do you think about Carol Burnett being the first celebrity to appear on Sesame Street?,Neutral
720,Not surprising. She is quite hilarious. A good fit for a show like that.,Neutral
720," She is really funny.  She's probably been searched a lot on youtube.  Speaking of, I've heard that youtube combined with netfilx makes up half of the peak internet traffic in the country.",Neutral
720,I think it is cool that youtube is pairing with tv stations to offer streaming for people that don't want cable.,Happy
720,I do too.  The site is owned by Google so hopefully that will keep costs down.,Neutral
720,It is really neat that the police have their own version of youtube. I would love to see some of the car chase videos.,Curious to dive deeper
720," I wonder if their site has the real videos, you know, nothing edited out or anything.",Neutral
720,I'm sure it is. I wonder if it is able to be accessed for trials and such.,Curious to dive deeper
720," That's an interesting thought.  I don't know.  That reminds me of Judge Judy.  Did you know she makes $123,000 per episode?",Neutral
720,I didn't. I'm not a fan of her. She doesn't seem like she follows the rules and just sort of goes with how she feels and if the people annoy her to make a ruling.,Disgusted
720,She does sometimes but those people agree to abide by her verdict when they go on her show.  i wonder if they do that because she is a celebrity.  She gets a lot of attention from the media and such.,Neutral
720,Maybe. I wonder if she has ever voiced a character based on her in a cartoon. That seems like a popular celebrity thing to do.,Curious to dive deeper
720," Yeah, ever since Robin Williams did Aladdin it has become a trend.",Neutral
720,I miss Robin Williams. He was a one of a kind talent.,Sad
720,He truly was.  It's sad to learn that he was depressed when he always seemed so upbeat and happy.  I wonder if he visited the secret room Pixar studio has.,Neutral
720,I could see him doing that. I think he really loved animated films like that. He tried so hard to make everyone around him laugh while he was so sad inside.,Sad
721,Have you seen the tv show Stranger Things?  It is quite the interesting horrow show,Curious to dive deeper
721,I havnt. Is it any good.,Happy
721,Yes it was originally based on Project Montauk - a supposed secret government program involving kidnapping children.,Neutral
721,Well it certainly sounds interesting.,Happy
721,It has some famous stars in it like Winona Ryder and David Harbour,Neutral
721,Thats cool. I like both of those actors.,Happy
721,Do you know any celebrities?  I met Robin Williams once right after he started the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films,Happy
721,I dont personally know any. Do you.,Happy
721," I met Judge Judy once - she makes $123k per episode, making her the highest paid celebrity after Lebron James.",Neutral
721,I would rather watch her than lebron any day. Lol.,Happy
721,Ethopia has a celebrity tv chef who is trying to combat hunger in his country,Neutral
721,That is good of him to do. Wonder how he is doing it.,Happy
721,He is encourage everyone to eat more diverse foods.,Neutral
721,I dont really see how that is combating hunger but ok.,Happy
721,It helps with farmers growing more crops and diversifying the fields.  I think it is funny that Pixar studio has a whole secret room for celebrities.,Curious to dive deeper
721,That is cool. I would really like to see that room.,Happy
721,I wonder if Carol Burnett ever went there - she was the very first celebrity to ever be on Sesame Street!,Curious to dive deeper
721,Im sure she has. I was never a big carol burnett fan tho.,Happy
721,Do you have any favorite videos on youtube?  That is a huge website these days..,Curious to dive deeper
721,I just watch it to find out how to do stuff. Like work on the car or something.,Happy
721,It is the largest searchengine out there.,Neutral
722,Hi there! How are you today? I've been watching TV.,Curious to dive deeper
722,Hey oh nice me too! What are your thoughts on politics in Hollywood? I think it is ridiculous! Event the kids choice awards are getting involved!,Curious to dive deeper
722,I have heard that The Nickelodeon kids choice awards got political.,Surprised
722,Yeah. Even back when they did their little voting campaign. MTV even paid to bus people to a march in Washington.,Curious to dive deeper
722,That's insane! I know Jaden Smith was a presenter that announced his presence at the March of Our Lives.,Surprised
722,Oh interesting. I think actors should just focus on acting. Like the Stranger Things tv show was amazing. So glad the Duffer Brothers created it.,Happy
722," Yes, agree! I'm not familiar with that show, but I think celebrities or celeb for slang should be neutral. ",Curious to dive deeper
722,Oh the show is great-it's on Netflix. Celebs are popular though. There is a guy with the same name as Justin Bieber who was banned from FB!,Surprised
722,Haha-that's great. Was it the show originally based on a secret government program involving the kidnapping of children for use in mind control experiments?,Curious to dive deeper
722,Yeah exactly! And actually David Harbour is an actor on the show and he tore his Achilles before!,Surprised
722," Oh, weird. I heard the actress that portrays Eleven's mom has lived her whole life with no legs.",Surprised
722,Holy cow that would be tough. The Stranger Things title font is also used in Paramounts fbi piracy warning!,Surprised
722," It would be tough. Oh, weird about the font! I am not into this type show, but I love shows like Judge Judy. Amazingly enough she is one of the highest paid celebs making 123k per episode!",Surprised
722," Oh wow. Yeah that is a good show. Do you like youtube? YT celebrity Jenna Marbles makes 346,000 per year!",Surprised
722,I do not know who that is. I know You Tube is the second largest search engine on the net though.,Surprised
722,Yeah so much power. Guess who was the most overrated celebrity in 2007: Paris Hilton lol.,Surprised
722," Yeah, I have not heard about her lately. I know You Tube was started by three former Paypal employees. What a good move!",Surprised
722,Yeah I thank them for that because I use it so much. It was created back in 2005! It is a google subsidiary.,Surprised
722,Did you know police have their own type of YouTube called blutube where they share law enforcement videos?,Curious to dive deeper
722,No I wonder if it helps catch criminals? Most of the content uploaded to youtube is by individuals but youtube also has some paid partnerships as well.,Neutral
722," I am not sure, but I'd think so! Youtube and Netflix make up half of peak internet traffic in north America. That might be why the cops have their own.",Surprised
722,Yeah good point. Google actually created a network that watched 10 minute youtube clips to recognize cats. Nice chatting with you!,Happy
723,Do you like hockey?,Curious to dive deeper
723,A little! I watch NHL games sometimes. Did you know that the USA olympic women's hockey team lost to a HS team?,Surprised
723," I bet that was humiliating, that's a hard defeat to recover from",Curious to dive deeper
723,Maybe they were just really good? India even beat the US 24-1 in the 1932 Olympics.,Surprised
723,Or maybe we have a terrible team. Did you hear about that hockey player that was traded for only one dollar?,Curious to dive deeper
723,Maybe! Ha no I didn't hear about that. Pretty embarrassing I think. Do you listen to country music?,Neutral
723," I do like country music, one of my favorite music genres, do you listen to it, do you like it?",Curious to dive deeper
723," I have recently started to listen to country music and I really like it. It used to be called ""Hillbilly music"" haha but Connie B. Gay coined the term ""Country music.""",Happy
723,I dont know about about Connie B but I do like George Strait,Curious to dive deeper
723," I do too, and Darius Rucker! In 1966 the album ""NFL Country"" was released. NFL players sang along with country music stars haha",Happy
723," That sounds like a great album, U2 used to play country in disguised, they wore wigs and costumes",Curious to dive deeper
723,That's interesting! I didn't know that and I'm a fan of U2. I heard that the Fender Stratocaster was intended only for country music.,Surprised
723,U2 is a great band and the Strotocaster is the best guitar ever!,Curious to dive deeper
723," Agreed! Off topic, did you know that the direction of Earth's magnetic field reverses every 200k-300k years?",Surprised
723,No I didnt know that on the other hand I did now we will be helium free by the end of this century,Curious to dive deeper
723,I wonder why and I wonder how people will be affected. I'm amazing to think that the earth is almost 4x as dense as the sun.,Surprised
723," The earth is just amazing, 71% of it is water and we live in a tiny 29% ",Curious to dive deeper
723,It is. And Jupiter protects the Earth from asteroids. The whole solar system is just amazing.,Surprised
723,So Jupiter is basically our superhero? I guess not all heroes wear capes lol,Happy
723,Haha very true. I was also really surprised to learn that you could fit all the planets between earth and the moon and still have room to spare.,Surprised
723," That is amazing, the moon looks so close but its so far away, thanks a lot for the chat by the way",Surprised
723,Great chat! Have a good day/night,Happy
723," Great chat indeed, a lot of cool facts, info, thanks again and have a great night",Happy
724,Are you much of a hockey fan?,Curious to dive deeper
724,Not really. Just never got into ito it to much. How about you.,Happy
724,I'm a pretty big fan. It's a fast game & the players really give it their all. In fact an average pro hockey player loses up to 8 pounds a game.,Neutral
724,That is crazy. Did you know that a new england high school team actually beat the womens olympic team 6-3.,Happy
724,That's surprising & embarrassing for the women's team. I appreciate the history of the sport. Hockey was in the first Winter Olympic games all the way back in 1924.,Neutral
724,I heard that. Allso it 1932 india beat the US 24-1 Thats kind of embarrassing as well.,Happy
724,Really? That's how sports are sometimes I guess. Are you much of a country music fan?,Curious to dive deeper
724,Yeah I love country music.,Happy
724,Did you know that U2 once opened for themselves in costumes as a fake country band in 1987?,Surprised
724,I did hear that actually. Its funny that nobody noticed it was them.,Happy
724,Yeah you'd think the crowd wold notice that. I recently read that George Strait & Jeff Bezos are cousins. Who would have guessed that?,Surprised
724,Not me. Lot of talent in that family huh.,Happy
724,Henry Ford helped finance & make country music popular because he thought Jazz was decadent.,Neutral
724," I dont know, I kind of like jazz. In 96 a nfl country was released. Did you hear about that.",Happy
724,No I didn't know that. Do you read much about science especially earth science?,Curious to dive deeper
724," Yeah, my son is really into science, so we are always learning new stuff and doing little experiments.",Happy
724,Did you know that when the Earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long?,Surprised
724,That would really make it hard to get the yard mowed huh.,Happy
724," Lol, yeah I think so. Once sad thing is that more than 80 percent of the earth's forests have been destroyed.",Sad
724,That is sad to think about.,Happy
724,Yes it's very sad. I enjoyed talking with you. Hopefully you have a good day.,Sad
725,Hello,Happy
725,Hello.  Do you know that there are many types of hockey?,Neutral
725,I do.  I played in elementary school,Happy
725,What kind do you play?  Is it field or ice hockey?,Curious to dive deeper
725,Ice hockey. I think field hockey is for those who take it a bit less seriously.,Happy
725,I see.   Was it hard to move a puck around?,Neutral
725," for the most part, I spent 98% of my time on the net.  The only time I ever got pulled off goal was to do workouts or coordination work.",Happy
725,How difficult is it to use a hockey stick compared to baseball bat?,Curious to dive deeper
725," In someways the same and some different.  It's a bit like the idea of trying to play golf with a bat.  Honestly, it's a little bit like fast paced competitive floor sweeping really.",Happy
725," I read an article that says ""An average professional hockey player will lose up to 8 pounds in one game.""  Did it happen to you?",Surprised
725,it's a bit like taking a shower with your clothing on.  You finish and you are soaked.  One way to get around the misery is to chew gum.  It keeps your mouth from drying out.,Happy
725,I see.  Did players lose weight fast only in one game?,Curious to dive deeper
725," oh totally, but it's...  usually afterwards, you drink a bottle of gatorade or powerade or even orange juice and you have recovered a lot of what you lost.  Everybody is different, but an hour after a game or a heavy practice and you are back to where you were, mostly.  Worst case, eat a donut or a couple clif bars.",Happy
725,Interesting. Thank you for your explanation.  Do you like country music?,Neutral
725,I'm listening to country right now.  I put some Darius Rucker on,Happy
725,nice.  I did not know that country music was originated in the south.  Do you know what state?,Neutral
725,I actually would have guessed Georgia.  It seems like a place where country would be really popular.,Happy
725,I am curious and I will research further later.  Country musicians use mostly string instruments.  Do they use drums?,Curious to dive deeper
725," oh, for sure.   other instruments, like banjos, pianos, horns and even organs show up, but lead guitar, bass and drums are still fairly common",Happy
725,Do you know that Amazon CEO and the country music legend george strait are cousins?,Surprised
725,I did not.  George Strait must be related to everybody.  His family must be huge,Happy
726,I can't believe the Golden Knights almost won the Stanley cup on their inaugural season.,Surprised
726,That's awesome! Were they the one who had the player who was traded for $1?,Curious to dive deeper
726," I don't believe so. They just had their first season last year, and did really well, when no one thought they would.",Curious to dive deeper
726," Oh. okay. The player who was traded, went on to win four Stanley cups.",Neutral
726," That's interesting, I was completely unaware of that. But yeah, the Golden Knights didn't do bad at all, were 1 game from being champions.",Neutral
726,It's saddening that only 20% of Earth's natural forests remain.,Neutral
726," Yeah, I certainly am not too enthused with the way things are going with the planet being abused lately.  For a 4.5 billion year old planet, it's a shame watching it get abused.",Sad
726,We will be helium-free by the end of the century.,Neutral
726," I never knew that, but that's an interesting fact. I wonder if helium has any other uses than balloons. I would assume so, but I don't know definitively.",Curious to dive deeper
726,Helium has a lot of other uses. Earth is also the most dense planet in the universe.,Neutral
726,I never knew that. It's crazy to think when earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long.,Surprised
726," That's interestin, as humans only represent a little over 1 minute in the 24 hour period.",Neutral
726," Very intriguing. On that note of humans, it's interesting to note that country music (or western) has been around since the 20's. While I'm not a fan, it's still interesting.",Surprised
726," Yes, and George Strait is a cousin of Jeff Bezos.",Neutral
726," I used to be a big fan of Amazon, but not so much lately, so I'm ok with them being related. And Henry Ford helped popularize country music.",Neutral
726,You can't really pick your relatives... I was surprised to learn that the Stratocaster was  developed for country music.,Neutral
726," That's pretty interesting to know, but it kind of makes sense with country being as old as it is, and rock not coming around until much later.",Surprised
726," Canada has two national sports, my favorite is lacrosse.",Neutral
726,I would assume the other being hockey. I know little of either (but more about hockey).,Neutral
726," Yes, hockey is the other one.",Neutral
726,I do know that in 1924 in the first Olympics team Canada scored 132 goals versus 3 they allowed.,Neutral
726,Did they have a hockey rink under the basketball court?,Curious to dive deeper
726," I do believe so. I had a friend who played hockey, and said they can lose up to 8 pounds in a game.",Neutral
726," That's a lot! Thank you for chatting with me, enjoy your day.",Neutral
726,You have a swell day as well.,Happy
726,Thanks,Neutral
727," Hello, do you like comedy?",Curious to dive deeper
727," Sure! Like Bill Murray, I think Kung Fu Hustle is the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy. You?",Happy
727," Yes, I liked Bill Murray back in the day when Kung Fu Hustle was out back in the 70's I think.  But now, I really like the lady comedies that were out not too long ago.like 'Bad Teacher', 'Bad Moms', and all those other funny movies led by the ladies.",Curious to dive deeper
727," Yeah. There was a time period where quite a few chick comedies came out that were pretty good, but we seem to be in a slump these days. Am I right?",Happy
727,True. Melissa McCarthy had quite a few comedy movies like Bridesmaids that was hilarious. Bridesmaids made over $169 million and was the second highest grossing movie of the year that wasn't a sequel.,Curious to dive deeper
727," She shined in that role.  But more typical these days are flops like, ""The Spy Who Dumped Me""  --  Did they really think a movie with the word ""Dumped"" in the title was going to fair well?",Happy
727,Good point. I like Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon's movie. It made just $24 million taken in it's first two weeks.,Curious to dive deeper
727," Not quite as popular as the movie ""Girls Trip"" but not a total loss like the movie ""Rough Night""",Happy
727," Yes, I really liked Girls' Trip, I thought it was really funny and I loved the cast.  I also liked male version movies with names like 'The 40-Year Old Virgin' and the 'Hangover' which had their heyday in the 2000s.",Curious to dive deeper
727," Yeah, but it has been a few years since be had a popular bromance like ""the Hangover"" or ""Harold and Kumar""...",Happy
727,That's true. Since there is a genre of movies called bromantic comedies that also included Pineapple Express as well.,Curious to dive deeper
727," Yeah. If you find a good comedian that can also act, and find th eright situation for them, you can get a pretty good film. But comedians thrive on failure too. Did you know that comedian Ryan Stiles dropped out of high school to pursue comedy?",Happy
727," Yeah, I've heard that one already as well. Comparatively speaking, Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star with over $8.5 billion in worldwide film earnings. He's both an actor and a celebrated comedian.",Curious to dive deeper
727," Talented comedian!  I also like comedian Demetri Martin. He's quite brilliant too!  He was accepted in into Harvard Law School, but dropped out because he was bored to pursue comedy. I'm thankful for that!",Happy
727," Yeah, comedy is still basically tied to its roots and originally came from theatrical Greek comedy. This is where two opposing sides are depicted as youth vs. the older generation and the youth loses because the young people are relatively powerless compared to their elders, in essence.",Curious to dive deeper
727," Deep.  So answer me this: Why did Trojan Wars do so bad at the box office, earning only $309, when the film had a $15 million budget? Was it a straight video film?",Curious to dive deeper
727," Wow, that's a good question. I don't know the answer but I do know that Disney's 'treasure planet' was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time. So that was worse than the Trojan Wars movie.",Curious to dive deeper
727," Was it as bad as Disney's Sleeping Beauty episode? Apparently, Disney considering closing down their animation studio when that movie failed expectations. Good thing they did not!",Happy
727," So, there's been a lot of flops out there as well as successes. I remember the Silence of the Lambs that came out on Valentine's Day 1991 and had a box office take of over $270 million. Wow.",Curious to dive deeper
727," A great date night movie for Valentines Day... Maybe a dinner theater where you and your partner can dine on Liver and Far var bean with a nice Chianti?   No, I would definitely still prefer a good old fashion slap stick comedy!",Happy
727," Me too! Nice chatting with you, have a good one!",Curious to dive deeper
728," Hi, Do you remember Dennis Rodman from the Bulls?  He visited Singapore for the Summit between Trump and Kim.",Surprised
728," Hello,  Yes I remember him,  he had different colored hair all the time!  Awesome.  ",Neutral
728,It seems like he was helping to bring peace between the countries.  He helped bring some awareness of issues.  He's been there multiple times since 2013.,Curious to dive deeper
728,It looks like Spain is a guest at every g20 summit!,Neutral
728," Wow!  Can you picture it with Rodman leaving North Korea last year wearing a t-shirt that said ""Ambassador Rodman!""  I wonder if he still dyes his hair or if he has to follow a different dress code.",Surprised
728," He can probably do whatever he wants since he was once a popular name. Speaking of North Korea,  it says Kim Jong un learned to drive at age 3,  wow Koreans must be pretty lax on driving laws lol ",Surprised
728,That sounds pretty scary.  Why do they do that?,Surprised
728,Why do they do what?,Neutral
728,Why did they teach Kim Jong to drive at age 3?,Surprised
728," I do not know.  I don't even know if anyone actually taught him.  I read recently that he LEARNED to drive at age 3.  He could've taught himself or stolen a car and learned by trial and error,  he could've watched youtube and followed instructions on driving. Not really sure,  there could be a lot of possibilities.",Neutral
728,I don't think youtube was around in 1986.    He was born in 1983 as the second child of Kim Jong-il and Ko Yong-hui.  Seems to have come from a line of leaders including the first leader of North Korea Kim II-sung,Curious to dive deeper
728," That wasn't really the point(ref Youtube) lol Yes,  his father and grandfather before him were Prime Ministers as well. ",Neutral
728,Kim Jong un must be a handsome guy because he was voted most sexiest man alive by the onion and china believes it.,Curious to dive deeper
728," lol I thought that was funny,  who is the onion?  I think its funny that I read no one knows how old kim jong un is.  Thats cuz Korean way of deciding age is different thatn america. ",Neutral
728," It says he was born January 8, 1983 making him 36 this week",Curious to dive deeper
728," Not really.  In Korea,  when you are born you are already 1 year old.  also if you are born in dec or jan,  before korean new year,  on Korean New Year you turn 2.  So its weird.  They don't calculate it like America. ",Neutral
728,Interesting.  I guess they are correct.  I wonder if that is because they view life as starting at conception.,Curious to dive deeper
728,oops sorry I made a mistake.  Yes everyone is 1 year old when they are born and all babies turn 2 on their next korean new years.  not just babies born in dec or jan.  So a baby can be less than a week old and be 2 years old.,Neutral
728," Oh, that's a little confusing to me.  Do you like basketball?  Did you know that the highest paid state employee is either a basketball or football coach in 39 of the 50 states?  Good use of tax dollars.",Curious to dive deeper
728," Right,  that is a little weird.  But good for them!  They making good money!",Neutral
728," Yes, they are!  I wonder if they work more hours than most in government that their pay is so high.  The inventor of basketball was a coach, but was the only losing coach in University of Kansas' history. Nice talking to you!",Surprised
729,I wonder how much of a voice we should give to a celebrity when it comes to foreign policy,Curious to dive deeper
729," In my opinion, for the most cases none.  Dennis Rodman and Kim Jong Un for example is pretty crazy.",Curious to dive deeper
729,Right!? He seems to be making headway though so how much leadway is good to give him or should he be granted official ambassador status because of their friendship?,Curious to dive deeper
729,Rodman always speaks very favorably of Kim Jong Un and theres more to it than that.,Curious to dive deeper
729,I think while he does speak highly of him that isn't necessarily a bad thing. It may be him taking advantage of a situation to keep an enemy closer for an avantage for his own country something our politicians might be smart to use.,Curious to dive deeper
729," I could normally believe that, but I haven't personally heard of Rodman doing something that wasn't for himself.  Him wearing an ""Ambassador Rodman"" shirt totally shifted the attention on himself.",Curious to dive deeper
729,Valid point but during the trying times in which we live any avenue to a summit without controversy or spying is a good thing.,Curious to dive deeper
729,That I can agree with.  But  I don't think Kim Jong Un wants to change at all.,Curious to dive deeper
729,No I don't think so either. He's a man who has been fed a certin retorhic all his life and now passes that on to his people. I think we are wise to be wary but that doesn't mean we won't have to deal with him eventually. I think one of the smart things the president has done is have a meeting with him.,Disgusted
729," Yup, for sure.  I wouldn't mind seeing a second meeting.  COnsidering we don't really know how old kim jong un is, it would be wise to at least be cordial for the time being.",Curious to dive deeper
729," I think of that meeting as a summit like with stalin, churchhill, and roosevelt. The times we are in don't seem that dissimilar. ",Curious to dive deeper
729," It does seem to be quite chaotic.  Curious what the next few years bring.  And what direction kim jong un takes north korea.  He's certainly in charge, being ""the Marshal"" and all.",Curious to dive deeper
729,We seem to have a lot of summit events but nothing is getting accomplished. Makes sense why Spain doesn't actually want to be part of the g20.,Angry
729," Spain doesn't impress me.  They seem to only be out for themselves, but are eager to take any handouts they can get.  I'd like to see them more involved internationally.  Not in the way Russia is though.  During a past g20 summit they gave delegates thumb drives containing viruses so they could spy on them.",Curious to dive deeper
729,The fact that a satire group risked imprisionment to impersonate some of Apec says to me that people see these as nothing but a big joke or a chance to steal information.,Disgusted
729," Quite possibly.  The canadian prime minister told Putin he needed to get out of ukraine, and you see how that went.",Curious to dive deeper
729,Honestly they seem like large children trying to all get their way with temper tantrums and foot stomping.,Disgusted
729,And nothing gets done.  It seems like there are so many summits now that they really aren't anything special.  They are pretty much just a form of international governance at this point.,Neutral
729," Exactly! I thnk the media has fueled this as well especially with inflammatory reports like the ones with Rodman, Trump and Kim. ",Disgusted
729," The media seems to fuel everything, just to get ratings.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you.  One of the more enjoyable one of these that I've had.",Neutral
729,You as well. It is nice to have a well reasoned discussion of things.,Neutral
730," How's it going? Did you know that the term ""summit"" wasn't used until 1955?",Curious to dive deeper
730," Hi, yourself.  No I didn't know that.  I know a summit is a big deal international meeting with lots of heads of state or governments.  Usually you hear about the G20 summit.",Surprised
730," Yea, I'm surprised at the g20 the Canadia PM shook Putin's hand and told him to get out the Ukraine, I would be more stern with Putin if I was there",Surprised
730," Ok, it's pretty risky saying that to Putin.  I heard the Russians one time gave out phone chargers and thumb drives that contained trojan viruses out at a G20 summit.  ",Curious to dive deeper
730,I bet the Russians have a lot of data on Spain since it is the only country that is a permanent guest at the g20,Neutral
730," I bet they do too.  Do you think Trump and Kim Jong- un are going to have another meeting, like the one in June 2018?",Curious to dive deeper
730," Yea probably, the meeting in June 2018 made both of them look good and both could use it as a distraction",Neutral
730," A distraction or a chance to spy on each other..lol I can't believe Kim Jong-un was voted the sexiest man alive by the ""Onion"", must be a state run organization.",Surprised
730," Yea that and him learning to drive at the age of 3, sounds too good to be true lol",Neutral
730,The teacher was probably persuaded to pass him.  A lot of children aren't even fully potty trained at age three.,Surprised
730,Yea plus Kim Jong has been known to edit pictures to show a different history so I think it's possible he could have photoshopped himself at 3 driving a car,Neutral
730," How true.  I read somewhere North Korea has theme parks and they are undergoing renovations at kim jong-un's orders.  Can you believe they have theme parks, there?",Surprised
730,Lol I have read about Kim Jong trying to build like the world's greatest water park to open only when the media is around so I can see him building more theme parks,Neutral
730," You know, I've heard that nobody really knows how old the guy is anyway.  All this spy technology and intelligence we have should be able to determine his age.  ",Surprised
730," I've heard he's a big basketball fan, I wonder if basketball coaches in Korea are the highest paid employees like they are in 39 out of 50 states in the US",Curious to dive deeper
730," Only if they're winners, I'm sure.  He probably puts the winning coaches up in his palace. Do you watch much basketball?",Curious to dive deeper
730," Only if my team (Knicks) have a chance at the postseason, which is mostly no. I think they have a worse record than James Naismith's University of Kansas teams",Neutral
730," Aww, too bad.  You know He invented basketball.  How ironic is that?",Surprised
730,Yea you figured since Naismith invented basketball he could of just changed the rules around to help him win lol,Surprised
730," Exactly my thoughts. You know Kareem Abdul- Jabbar was so good at dunking, it was banned from college basketball for over a decade.",Surprised
730," Kareem should of sued to change the rule, if the case made it to the Supreme Court he could of played with the justices on their basketball court",Neutral
730," That's right.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you.  I have to go wash my car, now.  I'll talk to you later.",Happy
731," So, it's pretty interesting that Dennis Rodman hasn't commented on that latest Trump/Kim Jong Un Summit. ",Curious to dive deeper
731,Yeah he might be feeling jealous or hurt that he was not invited.,Neutral
731," Although if he truly feels that emotionally connected to the cause of peace with NK, you'd think he'd be able to set aside personal slights. ",Curious to dive deeper
731,Yes that is true. I find it funny Shaq has only one recorded 3pt in his whole career.,Surprised
731,I didn't not know that!,Surprised
731,How about vasectomy rates rising during march madness. Serves as an excuse for men to stay home and watch the games.,Curious to dive deeper
731," I heard that was an urban legend, but if he makes guys more willing to go get the snip, I'm all for it. Do you think Ruth Bader Ginsburg plays H.O.R.S.E. at the SCOTUS court? ",Curious to dive deeper
731,I would like to see that. The lady is quite up there in age.,Curious to dive deeper
731," Although the hoop is 10 feet tall and she's like, what?, maybe four feet tall? ha.",Happy
731,You never know she might have hops. Or come out in Space Jam beast mode. That movie is the highest grossing basketball movie of all time.,Happy
731,Even more than Hoosiers? I'd like to see a buddy movie with Rodman and Kim Jong Un. They can go on various adventures.,Happy
731,That would be an amazing movie! That movie would be seen world wide.,Happy
731," Kim Jong Un can show us how he always shoots holes in one, or how he learned to drive at age 3 or was voted the sexist man alive...and next to Rodman he will seem like a very reasonable person!",Happy
731,So is it true Kim jon-un cuts his own hair for fear of barbers?,Curious to dive deeper
731," Possibly. We don't even know how old he really is, so it's hard to know anything for sure. ",Surprised
731,Very interesting character. I find it funny that his half brother used a fake passport to try getting to Disneyland.,Curious to dive deeper
731,The same half-brother he had killed? That's what you get for trying to sneak into the Magic Kingdom!,Curious to dive deeper
731,Not the happiest place on earth for that family. He also had a brother who was spotted at an eric clapton concert.,Surprised
731," Holding a lighter and swaying to Layla, most likely. Well, after this last summit broke down, I'm not sure how much more we will see of him. ",Happy
731,Yeah this summit did not end as everyone was expecting.,Surprised
731,But was it as bad as the g20 summit when Russia gave the US delegates thumb drives and phone chargers containing trojan viruses?,Neutral
731,That is almost unbelievable.,Disgusted
732,Hi do you like star wars?,Curious to dive deeper
732,I love it. Have you seen the FOrce Awakens one?,Curious to dive deeper
732,I have and do you know who plays the role of Poe Dameron,Curious to dive deeper
732,Yeah and he asked that he be a native of planet yavin 4 because it is filmed in guatemala where he is from,Curious to dive deeper
732,Nice. Did you know Lucas's wife won the academy award for editing?,Curious to dive deeper
732,Yeah because she added some scenes that mad the movie much better,Curious to dive deeper
732,Yeah she totally deserved it and glad that she was awarded and recognized for it,Curious to dive deeper
732,Exactly. Did you know that 20th century thought star wars was going to flop,Curious to dive deeper
732," Yeah and yet it made George a billionaire, He was confident enough in his work",Curious to dive deeper
732,Eactly he was smart to pay $500 000 and keep the rights to the movie,Curious to dive deeper
732,Yeah. do you like dance?,Curious to dive deeper
732," I love it. Bruce Lee was a dancer too, in cha-cha",Curious to dive deeper
732,Nice one. Tupac was a dancer too and he danced ballet,Curious to dive deeper
732,Yeah is was in a production of the nutcracker,Curious to dive deeper
732,Nice one Babies are also good at picking up dance when they hear music,Curious to dive deeper
732,Yeah and they smile more when they his the beat,Curious to dive deeper
732,Yeah so cute. DO you play or watch golf?,Curious to dive deeper
732,Not a lot but I know they us ea lot of water to maintain the courses,Curious to dive deeper
732,Yeah the average american one uses 312000 gallons a day,Curious to dive deeper
732,Yeah and one on Dubai uses 4 million gallons a day,Curious to dive deeper
732,WOw that is insane. Babe Ruth was a great golf player too,Curious to dive deeper
732," Yeah that impressive, he was good in more than just one sport",Curious to dive deeper
732,Yeah he sure was talented,Curious to dive deeper
733,I am a big fan of Star Wars - ever since I saw the first one in 1977,Happy
733,I am as well! Star Wars has been a huge success!,Happy
733," Yes the original 3 were released in 77, 80 and 83.  Then a prequel was released again starting in 1999",Neutral
733," Yes! The Force Awakens was a great one and the 1st 8 films were nominated for Academy awards, and rightly so!",Happy
733,Yes the franchise is worth at least 65 billion!  Its the fifth highest grossing film francise,Surprised
733," Exactly, it deserves all it has accomplished in entertainment!  James Earl Jones was only paid 7,500 bucks for 2.5 hours of recording all of Dath Vaders lines, that is insane!",Happy
733,Wow that is not very much!   Wonder if he still did it when it was re-dubbed into Navajo?,Curious to dive deeper
733," I am not sure, but he should have made a lot more money for sure. I guess when it all began 20th Century Fox thought Star wars would be a flop so they probably didn't figure to pay out too much.",Happy
733,Its funny that George Lucas's wife worked on it and got an award for editing while he did not get one for directing,Surprised
733," Hahaha, that's awesome for her...he deserved some recognition though. But George Lucus is a billionaire so...",Happy
733,Yeah he made a good deal by not taking the directing fee in exchange for keeping the licensing and merchandising rights,Curious to dive deeper
733,Exactly! Good choices on his part. So do you like to Golf at all? I was just playing miniature golf recently lol...,Happy
733,I do ok on putt putt but not so much at regular golf.  I always end up in the rough or the bunker or the watwer,Neutral
733," Me too! I don't have the patience lol. Interesting though that Babe Ruth was the best Golfer in America at one point, so crazy but he was talented!",Surprised
733,Yes there are definitely some natural athletes.  Lots of people love golf - golf courses in this country take upmore land than rhode island delaware combined!,Surprised
733," Wow, that is amazing. Doesn't surprise me though. Even Samuel L Jackson plays Golf during filming a movie!",Surprised
733,That is funny.  Golf courses can be so wasteful - there is one in Dubai that requires 4 million gallons of water a day!,Curious to dive deeper
733," What?? That is just insane. An average Golf course consumes over 300,000 gallons per day as well....that is a ton of water. ",Happy
733,That is a lot of water.  Very wasteful - especially in places that do not have a lot,Curious to dive deeper
733," Exactly! I was reading about Bruce Lee recently, and he was so good at dancing he won the championship in the 50s for the Cha Cha in Hong Kong....I wonder if he played Golf too lol",Happy
733,That is crazy!  Ballet is very athletic though!,Neutral
734,do you like Star Wars?,Curious to dive deeper
734,I do Did you know 20th century fox did now think it would be popular?,Curious to dive deeper
734,Yes they were convinced it would fail originally,Curious to dive deeper
734,Yeah so they sold the rights to George Lucas for half a million,Curious to dive deeper
734,Nice. Did you know his wife won an Oscar for editing of the film?,Curious to dive deeper
734,Really I did not know she was involved in it,Curious to dive deeper
734," Yes she was, she was the once that added the leis good luck kiss scene in there",Curious to dive deeper
734,Oh wow. Did you know James Cameron was a truck driver?,Curious to dive deeper
734,Rerally? WOw. Jamer Jones spent only 2.5 hours reading the Darth Vader lines,Curious to dive deeper
734,That is it? How much did he get paid for it?,Curious to dive deeper
734,Yes only $7500. Did you know the movie was also dubbed in Navajo,Curious to dive deeper
734,That is so nice. DO you like dance?,Curious to dive deeper
734,I sure do. Bruce Lee was also a great dancer,Curious to dive deeper
734,Nice awesome. Emilia Clarke did the chicken dance and robot dance when she auditioned for Daenaeryus,Curious to dive deeper
734,Haha that is amazing. Yeah Bruce Lee won the cha cha championship in 1958,Curious to dive deeper
734,Wow amazing. Parrots are good at dancing to music,Curious to dive deeper
734,Nice. DId you know ballet dancers use 4 pairs of shoes a week?,Curious to dive deeper
734,WOw that is a lot of shoes and also a lot of money,Curious to dive deeper
734,I know. Babies are also good at dancing when they hear music,Curious to dive deeper
734,Nice. There are ballet shoes now that make drawings based on how the dancers move,Curious to dive deeper
734,So amazing . Nice chat today,Happy
735,Are you a fan of the NBA?,Curious to dive deeper
735,Somewhat.  I dont follow too closely though.  You?,Neutral
735," I love the NBA, I am a bulls fan. I love michael jordan!",Curious to dive deeper
735,Me too!  He is my all time favorite.,Neutral
735,Did you know Nike used to pay Jordans fines for wearing his signature shoes?,Curious to dive deeper
735," Yeah, the NBA wouldnt allow the shoes but Nike didnt care.",Neutral
735," For sure, it was great advertisement for them from such a star player",Curious to dive deeper
735,It was indeed.  They have more than made that fine money back from all those sales.,Neutral
735," for sure, I liked Iverson, talk about a player making big money from shoes",Curious to dive deeper
735,Man he was smart on that deal.  His family is set for a long long time.,Neutral
735," For sure, however, from what I heard, he has no money and gets a bulk of it at age 55",Curious to dive deeper
735," He was getting $800,000 a year and then 32 mil at 55.  ",Neutral
735," I think he is spending more than that per year and asking for cheeseburgers from people on the street, no joke",Curious to dive deeper
735,Wow.  60% of players are broke 5 years after retirement.  Poor money management.,Neutral
735," I believe that, Michael Jordan will never be broke, guy is so rich",Curious to dive deeper
735,His son cost his school a $3 mil adidas contract because he insisted that he wanted to wear his fathers line of Nikes,Curious to dive deeper
735," Dang, that isn't right, not how it should be!",Curious to dive deeper
735,Not at all. Kim Jong Un even is obsessed with Jordan,Neutral
735,That is crazy to think!,Curious to dive deeper
735,He would spend lots of time drawing pictures of him,Neutral
735,Good chatting with you!,Curious to dive deeper
736," Hello,  have you watched iron Man?",Happy
736,I have! It was great!,Happy
736," I agree!  I recently re watched it,  very funny too. I love the part where he is experimenting with the first suit he made and a lot goes wrong lol ",Happy
736,LOL. Robert Downy Jr was an awesome choice to play Iron Man!,Happy
736,I read somewhere that Iron Man's suit is roughly about 450 pieces !  Crazy right!,Surprised
736,That is insane. i wonder how many pieces to put on?,Curious to dive deeper
736,I have no clue!  lol Did you know JARVIS stands for Just A Rather Very Intelligent System?,Surprised
736,i dont think i did. that makes sense though givien the technology in the movie and the exoskeleton suit,Neutral
736," The actor who plays JARVIS,  Paul Bettany,  has never even seen Iron Man!  They paid him so much money to do it and he doesnt even care to see the movie lol ",Surprised
736,wow. thats interseting,Surprised
736,The director chose to film in California because most of the super heroes takes place on the east coast!,Happy
736," Hmm...why is that? lol The director was Jon Favreau, right?",Curious to dive deeper
736,Right. I read that he did that because most of the super heroes take place in the east coast.,Curious to dive deeper
736,Was that the directors choice though? Or was it one of the writers? Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway were the writing teams I believe.,Neutral
736," I read it was Jon Favreau's choice.  this film was in development for a long time,  like 13 years or something. ",Curious to dive deeper
736," Holy Cow lol that is insane! And if i remember right, it came out in 2008. I don't remember what years the other ones came out. I wonder how long those were in development? ",Curious to dive deeper
736," Yeah,  I think Iron Man was this first to release of the Marvel movies,  so they released after Iron Man.  I read somewhere Tom Cruise and Nicholas Cage were also considered to be Iron Man. ",Neutral
736,Yuck lol. That move would have been horrible I think. I just cant picture that lol.,Disgusted
736,Right!  lol Wouldve been totally different.,Surprised
736,I wouldn't have even seen it lol. That would have gone on to ruin the avengers movies lol .,Disgusted
736," They probably wouldnt have made spin offs if Iron Man tanked in the box office! haha,  been good chatting. ",Neutral
737," Hello, Do you like basketball?",Neutral
737," Hello there, I do like basketball and my team has the best record in the league right now.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
737," Yes, I enjoy watching basketball. I am a fan! Interesting Kim jong-un was obsessed with basketball.",Happy
737,Yeah I think that is interesting.  I think US players went there for an exhibition years back.,Curious to dive deeper
737," Yes, I think you are right. How about Michael Jordan's dream shoe, and was thinking about ditching Nike.",Neutral
737," Yeah it sounds like a bad designer or inexperienced one tried making a version, and it didn't go over well. ",Curious to dive deeper
737,Did you see Iron Man? I remember seeing it years ago.,Curious to dive deeper
737," No, I never saw that one, or the other ones, I think there are a few but I could be wrong. ",Curious to dive deeper
737," American superhero films, Do you like Robert Downey, Jr as an actor?",Curious to dive deeper
737," Yeah I think he is pretty good, I liked most of the movies he was in during the 80's. ",Curious to dive deeper
737," Yes, Marvel Comics are very popular. They are always putting out new films.",Neutral
737," Yeah they are, I think they have endless possibilities for more movies to come as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
737,I just loved watching Michael Jordan play basketball. What a talent!,Neutral
737," Yeah I was definitely a fan when I was growing up, I think most people were, his post up fake shake move was deadly. ",Curious to dive deeper
737," lol, yes your right! Very interesting his best friend being a limo driver when he first arrived in 1984.",Neutral
737," That is very cool, did you know he is the principal owner and chairman of the Hornets?",Curious to dive deeper
737," Yes, Its funny the granny style is the best technique but the players think it looks stupid. lol",Curious to dive deeper
737," That is funny, I am curious why more players don't use that technique. ",Curious to dive deeper
737," lol, I know, interesting Nike would pay the fine each game to wear the Jordans.",Curious to dive deeper
737," Yeah that was the best marketing Nike could of ever dreamed of, banned by the league because they gave you an edge. ",Curious to dive deeper
737,Makes sense. Allen Iverson made a lot of money with Reebok.,Neutral
737," Yeah I bet they are wishing they could take that contract back now.  It was nice talking with you, I hope you have a good night. ",Happy
738," Hi, how are you?",Neutral
738," I am great, just enjoying my evening.",Neutral
738," Do you like hockey? Not really a fan. Don't know much about the game. I do know that Canada is the only country in the world with two national sports, lacrosse and ice hockey.",Neutral
738,I am a Canadian so I like the sport as a default. The snow is pilled up in mountains and the ice rinks are busy.,Curious to dive deeper
738,Is there nothing else to do in the great land of Canadia in the winter?,Curious to dive deeper
738,People love to get together and watch games in sports bars and parties. Olympic Hockey is a national moment.,Neutral
738," In 1924, the first Olympic winter games, Canada scored 132 goals and let in 3 in the entire ice hockey competition. It sounds like the Canadians were angry and punishing everyone else. Why so vindictive? Were they angry about the Canadian winter?",Curious to dive deeper
738," Not angry, winter with it;s cold and snow is just apart of our lives for a third of the year. It must have been like playing with children for those Olympic players. Things have changed and more countries have grown to love and respect the sport.",Disgusted
738," The sport deserves respect. There are some amazing players. For example, a hockey player was traded for $1 in 1993. He later won four Stanley Cups. How did he win the Stanley Cup by himself? Astounding. He must have been Canadian.",Curious to dive deeper
738,Apparently an average player works so hard that they loose 8 pounds just playing one game.,Neutral
738,Where does it all go? Does it turn into ice?,Curious to dive deeper
738,You need a lot of water to fill those ice rinks.,Neutral
738,An ice hockey ring remains under a basketball court when switching stadium sports. What would James Naismith say about that? He was Canadian. Would he give his blessing?,Curious to dive deeper
738,I would be interested in seeing how other countries like Finland and the Czech Republic run their ice rinks and stadiums.,Neutral
738," Speaking of other countries, have you traveled outside of the great nation of Canadia? The world is big, my friend, and not every nation has winter year^round. ",Curious to dive deeper
738,I like Europe and the way they use bicycles to travel in their daily lives.,Neutral
738," That's great! Does Canadia have cars, or is it like Mackinac island, MI? Do people take dog sleds to work? Do they skate to school?",Curious to dive deeper
738,We make your American and Japanese cars using steel. Most of Canada is along the southern boarder with small hardy communities in the north much like in Alaska.,Disgusted
738," The first king to travel around the world was King Kalakaua of Hawaii. The first Canadian to travel around the world will also be famous, I'm sure. Well, I enjoyed chatting with you!",Neutral
738," Yes, you should read about Champlain who settled Quebec.",Neutral
738,I should. I am so ignorant about the world. I have not traveled.,Disgusted
738," Well, it is an interesting world with many unique communities. I like to learn how those communities reflect their natural environment. ",Neutral
738,That is a noble pursuit. I should visit Canadia one day.,Neutral
738," Yes, and do not expect to see the Canadian Mounted Police wearing those unique hats when you come. You can only see those at special tourist events.",Neutral
738," Ok, I'll lower my expectations about the hats. ",Sad
739," Hey there, how are you doing?  Are you a hockey fan?",Curious to dive deeper
739," Good, thanks. Not really .Though I do prefer ice hockey to field hockey. In most of the world when you say hockey they will understand you as talking about field hockey.",Surprised
739,Good point.  I'm getting converted to ice hockey.  I've never watched it much but I watched where they let a Navy goalie practice the the St. Louis Blues.  It was fun to watch and has got me a little more into the sport for sure.,Curious to dive deeper
739," I think it would be even more fun to watch the 1930 game where a hockey goalie caught fire whe a puck hit a pack of matches in his pocket. Wait, I hope he was okay!",Surprised
739,Okay that is crazy!   I heard that an average professional hockey player will lose up to 8 pounds in one game.  Probably more if he's on fire right?,Curious to dive deeper
739," Haha, most likely. I'd like to see the Slovakian women's hockey team in action. They beat Bulgaria 82 to 0 meaning they scored about one goal every 44 seconds. Boy, I would hate to eb the Bulgarian goalie!",Surprised
739,Ha me too.  I'm almost sure I could probably play a little better than that on a really good day.  I was thinking Iceland would probably have a good hockey team.  But I was wrong.  Do you know they have no public rail service and if they don't own a car most Icelanders use domestic flights to travel between major towns?,Curious to dive deeper
739," Interesting! Speaking of flights, they are 10% slower than they were in the 60s. This is to save on fuel.",Surprised
739,That's interesting.  You'd think it would be faster now right?  The Dutch are crating a commuter bus that is designed to travel at 160 mph.  Not sure how I feel about that.,Curious to dive deeper
739,Ya i was thinking that. Another change is airports make travelers walk further so that they don't have to fetch baggage as fast.,Surprised
739,That makes sense.  I've never thought about it like that.  But I definitely can see that it is happening.  So even when you travel by plan you are still technically travelling by foot.   The Mackinac Island has banned motorized vehicles for over 100 years now.  They travel by horse drawn carriages or bikes.,Curious to dive deeper
739,I would probably be more in shape if I lived there. Wonder if anyone who lives there participates on the website for people to crash on your couch while they are traveling.,Curious to dive deeper
739,That would make me nervous I think.  Both as the owner of the couch or the person crashing on it!   I'd probably be so nervous I'd end up doing something bizarre and they'd put me in a dunce cap.  Did you know the conical party hats were derived from dunce caps.  It was made to encourage people at parties to behave more foolishly.,Curious to dive deeper
739," Ha, funny. I wouldn't want a dunce hat, but I would want a top hat and sword that comes with a PhD in Finland!",Surprised
739," A sword, really?  LOL  Until 1998 British politicians had to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the house of commons.  Strange right?",Surprised
739," Haha, that would be funny. Did you ever wonder why London black cabs are so tall? They were designed to accomodate bowler hats.",Curious to dive deeper
739,That's too funny.  They things we do for fashion.  Did you know the bowler hat was the most popular had in the old west.  Not the cowboy hat like most people think.,Curious to dive deeper
739,And I didn't know the folds in a chef's hat represented the many ways a chef can cook an egg!,Surprised
739," All right, I learn something new every day!  I had no idea either. You know back to hockey I really think I'm going to try and get to a few games this season.  I really am impressed with the St. Louis Blues.  They gave a Navy goalie a chance to practice with them.  He'd been skating since he was 3 and playing hockey since he was 4.  Can you imagine how thrilled he was to get to practice with the pros?",Curious to dive deeper
739," Yeah, for him, the Navy and hockey were two totally different aspirations.",Surprised
739,So true.  Hey it's been great visiting with you.  Have a great rest of your day!  Don't eat eggs from a chef with no folds in his hat!!,Neutral
739," Haha, I won't! Yeah, I wondered, does a cook custom fold his or her hat for the amount of types of eggs they can cook or do the folds come like that for all cooks? Hmm, eggs for dinner sounds nice! See you!",Curious to dive deeper
740,Do you like hockey?,Curious to dive deeper
740,I do like watching it!  Are you a fan?  I always look forward to watching the annual NHL winter classic where they play outdoors.,Happy
740," I am a fan, I like the sport, its more popular in Canada though, its actually one of its national sports",Curious to dive deeper
740,Yes.  I live up North near Lake Erie and before the tv signals went digital I was able to use a tv with an antenna to pick up Hockey night in Canada during the week.  It was like Monday Night football here in the states.  I'm a sports fan so at the time it was great to be able to watch that in the middle of the week.,Happy
740," I can see your point, strange fact about the game but pro players lose about 8 pounds per game",Curious to dive deeper
740,Wow.  I believe it.  Having to skate and carry around all that extra padding is physically tough.  The Slovakian women's team once beat Bulgaria 82-0!  That's a goal every 44 seconds!,Happy
740," Wow, thats a humiliating score, and painful to watch if you are a Bularia fan, ",Surprised
740,Yes. lol  The U.S. Olympic women's hockey team once lost to a New England high school team by a score of 6-3.  That had to be humiliating as well.  lol,Happy
740," For sure, loosing against a high school team, that will rise worries in me, I bet the coach got fired and the team replaced",Curious to dive deeper
740,LOL I don't know.  They once had hockey in the summer olympics in 1932 and India beat the U.S. that year 24-1.,Happy
740," Maybe we just have a terrible team lol, do you like to travel?",Curious to dive deeper
740,LOL  I love traveling!,Happy
740," Im a fan of travel too, I hear the Dutch are creating a really fast commuter bus",Curious to dive deeper
740,I wish we had a better bus and train system here in the U.S.  Air travel is up to 10 percent slower now that it was in the 1960's in order to save fuel costs.  That's something I wouldn't have guessed.,Happy
740," Me neither, I would have though its faster now with the tech we now have Japan seems like a nice country to visit",Curious to dive deeper
740,Yes.  That's what I thought.  Do you like wearing hats?,Happy
740," I do like wearing them, the cowboy hat is one of my favorites",Curious to dive deeper
740,I used to have one when I was in 4H for horses.  When you get a phd in Finland you are given a top hat and a sword with your diploma!,Happy
740," Thats a great tradition, its great that an accomplishment like that one is valued by others, you know that in the old west the most popular hat was actually the Bowler hat",Curious to dive deeper
740," I didn't know that!  There are many uses for a hat...some for protection, some for function, and some simply for style.",Happy
740,I am grateful for hats not only they look great but they protect us from the sun,Happy
741,Do you like hockey? I'd feel pretty defeated if I was the other goalie in the 1924 Olympics who let in 132 goals.,Sad
741," Haha. I love hockey. It's the only sport where super dramatic things like that happens. Like in 1930, when a hockey goalie caught on fire because a puck hit a pack of matches in his pocket. Like, why did he have matches in his pockets anyway?",Neutral
741,Right?! That's crazy! It's also crazy that they can lose 8 lbs in a game...many people would love those workout results!,Surprised
741,What about when they used to only have one penalty box? I bet they could lose even more weight when their fights inevitably carried over into the time out.,Neutral
741,True! Can you imagine a suffragette using their hatpin as a weapon...I wonder how long they were to have to limit their length?,Curious to dive deeper
741," The Peaky Blinders gang in London got their name from wearing razor blades in their hats, a style which used to be called peaks, and swing them at their victims. Thus, earning the name. So I guess using hats as a weapon used to be common!",Neutral
741,Must've been! I never knew bowlers were more common than cowboy hats in the old west...I wonder when that changed.,Curious to dive deeper
741," So common, in fact, that the London cabs are designed to be taller to accommodate their shape.",Neutral
741,London cabs makes me think of taxis lol. I've been to Mackinac Island where motorized vehicles are banned and it's pretty cool!,Happy
741," That is cool! Do you like to travel? I love traveling, but weary on planes. It's hard to imagine that airplanes are 10% slower now than they used to be because fuel is more expensive.",Neutral
741," I like traveling as well too, but also don't like planes! They always say traveling overseas is cheaper because everything is so close together...guess that's not true in Japan if it costs you $300 to go across the country!",Surprised
741," Well, to save money, you could always use one of those couch-crashing websites!",Neutral
741,True! I don't think I'd feel very safe on a commuter bus going 160mph either!,Fearful
741," Who would! Though, people are all about the instant gratification. They decided to start making people walk farther to baggage claim so they didn't complain when the bags took too long to unload after landing.",Neutral
741,King Kalakaua didn't need instant gratification because I'm sure traveling around the world takes awhile!,Surprised
741,Who was King Kalakaua?,Curious to dive deeper
741,He was the first King to travel the world!,Neutral
741," Oh wow! I guess he did it by ship? Apparently, ships used to release rabbits on islands in case future travelers got hungry!",Neutral
741," That's an awesome idea! I'm not sure if he did it by ship, but if he was from Iceland he would've flown because if they don't have cars they fly from town to town.",Curious to dive deeper
741,That's cool. I wonder if they wear Ushanka hats in the winter time like the arctic people of Asia.,Neutral
741,Not sure! It was nice talking with you!,Neutral
742,Hello - do you like Physics?,Curious to dive deeper
742," i find Physics interesting, but it was never my best subject in school. what about you?",Neutral
742,I like physics as well. Kim Jong-Un has a degree in physics.,Surprised
742,does he really? I wonder if that's wy he likes nuclear stuff so much,Neutral
742,Haha right! Pixar spent 3 years studying physics of curly hair in order to render Merida's hair in the movie Brave.,Surprised
742," thats so much effort to animate some hair in a movie, holy moly. can you imagine that being your life for those 3 years?",Surprised
742,I agree. The universe could have come from nothing without violating physics.,Surprised
742," Stephen Wolfram, the dude that invented Wolfram alpha, wrote 3 physics books by age 14. That kid must have been some sort of savant",Surprised
742," Wow, I bet he's very smart. Ancient Chinese dye use on the terra cotta army might lead to a breakthrough in quantum physics.",Surprised
742,i cant eve begin to imagine why haha the two seem completely unrelated,Neutral
742,I agree. Do you like to read?,Curious to dive deeper
742," I like to sometimes yea, i read a lot of graphic novels. what about you?",Neutral
742," I don't read too much anymore, but I used to read a lot of war novels.",Neutral
742,who was your favorite author?,Neutral
742,I like a guy named Johnny Clarke. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
742,Im a big fan of Kurt Vonnegut,Neutral
742,That's good. The world record for speed reading is 4700 words per minute. That's fast!,Surprised
742,per minute? how do you comprehend that fast i wonder?,Surprised
742,I don't even know how that works to be honest.,Surprised
742," thats like, almost  80 words per second! i cant imagine being able to read that fast",Neutral
742,Good chatting.,Happy
743,do you like physics?,Curious to dive deeper
743," I sue do, it explains so much about us and you?",Curious to dive deeper
743,Me too. Kim Jong Un has a degree in it,Curious to dive deeper
743,Cool. Pixas spent s a lot of hours trying to figure out the hair for Medina using physics,Curious to dive deeper
743,Yeah they spent 3 years to make sure it is correct,Curious to dive deeper
743,yeah. THe universes might have no existed if laws of physics were not boken,Curious to dive deeper
743,Yes that is one of the theories based on current observations,Curious to dive deeper
743,Yeah. There is a due that is believed to help with new discoveries in quantum physics,Curious to dive deeper
743,Yeah it is an ancient chinese dye,Curious to dive deeper
743,Yeah. the creator of wolfram alpha got his PhD when he was 20,Curious to dive deeper
743,Yes in Theoretical Physics at it,Curious to dive deeper
743,Yeah. Do you enjoy reading?,Curious to dive deeper
743,I love it. Have you ever read Starship troopers?,Curious to dive deeper
743," I have, it is pretty good and the military branches recommend it too",Curious to dive deeper
743," Yeah. Same with Ender's Game, many military organizations recommend it",Curious to dive deeper
743,Yeah. Do you know who TOlkien and CS Lewis were?,Curious to dive deeper
743,Yes they used to have you laugh you lose competitions with each other,Curious to dive deeper
743,Yeah and all of that over bad poetry. Cool guys,Curious to dive deeper
743,Yeah. DId you now there was moral panic because people were reading in the 18th century?,Curious to dive deeper
743,Yeah and nowadays we have panic because of the other way around,Curious to dive deeper
743," Exactly, we are in dire need for people to read",Curious to dive deeper
744,I absolutely love to read. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
744," me too, I ant get enough of it! do you have a favorite author?",Curious to dive deeper
744,I love mary higgins clark for modern stuff but as far as vintage you can't beat lewis and tolkien.,Neutral
744,Lewis like CS Lewis?,Curious to dive deeper
744,Yes. I think he has some of the most iconic work of his time. His ability to weave a story is simple amazing.,Neutral
744,I never got too into his stuff when I younger! I was more of a Captain Underpants and Harry Potter kid,Neutral
744,Those were two I never really got into. Have you ever read starship troopers or ender's game?,Curious to dive deeper
744," I have not, I didnt even know Starship troopers was a book until recently! I thought the movie was an original work of art. And Ender's Game i think i just missed",Neutral
744,I think it is fascinating that the military puts both of them on their reading lists. I would have thought it would be limited to things like the art of war and the like.,Surprised
744,Art of war might be a little aggressive haha they dont want them to be killing war machines. Or do they....?,Curious to dive deeper
744,Well since it is the military who knows. It's not like we are cultivating a bunch of scientists.,Neutral
744," anyone can be a scientist though! For instance, the Emperor of Japan is still one and even consistently publishes papers",Neutral
744,That is awesome though. I think we would be much better served in the US if we had few lawyers in power and more people of science and education.,Disgusted
744,i agree. we need more well rounded people in power like that,Neutral
744,Imagine if we had someone like John Von Neumann. He has so much knowledge and seems to be a well reasoned person. Not completely reactionary and polarized like our current house and senate.,Curious to dive deeper
744," That guy might not be very spokesman like though, which a politician does need to be. Scientists are fascinating though. Like the ones from Harvard that put  a gif onto DNA. ",Neutral
744,I think sometimes scientists do do things just because they can though and that can get ridiculous. Like what is the point of storing a gif in dna?,Curious to dive deeper
744," haha yea probably, they did it because it seemed like a fun thing to do",Neutral
744,True. I am grateful for the english ones working in switzerland that gave us the internet for sure.,Neutral
744,without which we wouldnt be here today! although in the internet has some big downsides,Neutral
744,It does but I think we are ultimately better for it.,Neutral
745,I wish i knew more about physics!,Curious to dive deeper
745," Ooh, please allow me to elucidate on the subject. Firstly, did you know Kim jong-un has a degree in physics? ",Curious to dive deeper
745,LOL... no i did not!,Curious to dive deeper
745," True story! Back to our regularly scheduled programming - Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves.",Curious to dive deeper
745,yeah... it pretty much play a part in everything... look at pixar for example!  They studdied the physics of curly hair for 3 years to get merida's hair right!,Happy
745," Say what???She was from the movie Brave, right?",Neutral
745,Yes she was.. a great movie for sure!,Happy
745," My kid likes it. Speaking of kids, did you know that the Wolfram alpha creator received his phd on theoretical physics at the age of 20?",Neutral
745,That's crazy!!!  Goodfor him!,Happy
745," I'm not very scientific - did you know that Akihito, the emperor of japan, is a scientist and still publishes papers to this day?",Neutral
745,No i did not!  Funny that harrison schmidt was the only scientist to walk on the moon!,Surprised
745," I know, I would have thought more of them would have been so. My kid is 6 and is just reading. The scientist john von neumann could by the age of 6, divide two 8 digit numbers in his head and converse in ancient greek. Crazy!",Neutral
745,That is crazy!  WOW... the world record for reading is 4700 words a minute!  What the...,Surprised
745," I just read your like 10 word response above in a minute - I'm slow and not very smart. Good thing for the internet - invented in 1989 by an english scientist working in switzerland for the cern, a european state-funded research organization.",Curious to dive deeper
745,Awww.. you are not all those... you can still read ;),Happy
745," Haha, thanks! I like to laugh - Cs lewis and tolkien held ""you laugh you lose"" competitions when reading terrible poetry. That'd make poetry a bit more fun, right?",Neutral
745,Yeah me too... would of loved to be a part of that group!!!,Happy
745,I'm more of a movie watcher. I enjoyed Starship Troopers. Did you know it is the first sci-fi novel on the reading lists of three of the five us military branches?,Neutral
745,oh really... that's cool! So was Enders game,Curious to dive deeper
745," Never read it but I am aware that it was was suggested reading for many military organizations, including the united states marine corps. Maybe we should read, eh?",Neutral
745,yeah... let's read... heheheeee :p,Happy
745," Nah, I'll wait for the movie...",Neutral
746,Hello do you like william shakespere?,Curious to dive deeper
746,i know a little about him. please tell me something about BIll S.,Neutral
746,Did you know Pocahontas and shakespere were alive at the same time? Only died a year apart!,Curious to dive deeper
746,whoa. did not know that. Bill wrote a ton of plays and stuff. he probably would have really impressed pocahontas.,Neutral
746," Maybe.  She really like singing though lol Shakespere invented the names miranda,  jessica and olivia!",Curious to dive deeper
746,The man created like a thousand new words! what a genius. he wrote too much! how did he find time to write all that stuff?,Neutral
746,Probably in the time that he lived Im sure there wasnt as much to do as there is now lol,Curious to dive deeper
746," Yeah, but i imagine that it was a bit of work to write with quill and ink on parchment. he must have written pretty quick.",Neutral
746," Oh right,  thats a good point. Do you like the universe?",Curious to dive deeper
746," The universe is big and impersonal, but it has been pretty good to me so far. what do you think?",Neutral
746,Full of mysteries.  Some scientist theorize that the universe evolves through natural selection.,Curious to dive deeper
746,i guess ours is pretty good then? with pretty good physical laws and constants? i hope we'll be around for a while.,Neutral
746," I think so,  some believe that the universe is one giant hologram lol",Curious to dive deeper
746,Um what does that make me and you? are you a hologram? am i chatting with a hologram?,Neutral
746," I dont think that holograms can actually enact anything,  they are just an image.  I am not a hologram,  more possibly an artifical intelligence lol ",Curious to dive deeper
746," Oh, boy. I had my concerns, now I am worried. Do you watch John Oliver? Repeat after me: ""I am not a robot""",Neutral
746," lol sorry but it is a possibilty!  Like that show Westworld,  have you seen it?  No I dont watch John Oliver.",Curious to dive deeper
746," I have seen westworld. it is an intriguing vacation for the wealthy. but if i am a robot, will they let me go to westworld?",Neutral
746,You are probably already there....you just dont know it.,Curious to dive deeper
746," Oh no. this is my vacation? chatting online? i guess it is employment purgatory. anyway, great chat!",Neutral
746," lol maybe you are not on vacation,  this is just one of your daily duties.  Yes,  excellent chat,  thank you. ",Neutral
747," Hello, what type of books do you like to read?",Curious to dive deeper
747," I'm a big fan of science fiction, fantasy, and classics, but I'll read almost anything you put in front of me. Are you a fan of reading too?",Curious to dive deeper
747," I like auto biography and true crime mostly but if the writer is good, I will read fantasy, comedy and more! Did you know that William Shakespeare is considered the greatest writer in the English language?",Happy
747,I've read that he was so influential that many colloquialisms and turns of phrase we use today were popularized by his works.,Neutral
747," Yes, did you also know that he invented the names, Jessica, Miranda and Olivia? I never knew that!",Surprised
747," I had no idea! I've read a few of his plays, but I'd love to see them acted out. Apparently a few theater companies, Faction of Fools and WSC Avant Bard, are planning on doing a few.",Curious to dive deeper
747," That would be great to see them, I agree. I like plays, but haven't been to see one in about 15 years.",Neutral
747," Do you have a specific one you'd like to see? One company is putting on Henry V, but I haven't read that play yet.",Curious to dive deeper
747," I'm a romantic at heart so I believe it would have to be Romeo & Juliet, I've never seen it. We have a wonderful little playhouse in my town, I wonder if they've ever done it, I will have to check it out.",Curious to dive deeper
747," Romeo & Juliet is a great one to see. I love the original most, but the movie that was set in contemporary times is also good. WSC Avant Bard is doing something similar with a modern version of Shakespeare's Illyria.",Happy
747,I see that Shakespeare was only 52 years old when he died in 1616. Do you know what he died from?,Curious to dive deeper
747," I don't, but I think lifespans back then weren't as long as they are now. It's amazing how much he wrote in that time though - 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two longer poems, and more.",Surprised
747," True, I always heard that he died on his actual birthday. He did a lot in his life, true and lifespans were shorter then too.",Surprised
747,I always thought it was funny that he married someone named Anne Hathaway. It was interesting to learn that after seeing films with the actress Anne Hathaway.,Happy
747," Yes, I was thinking that same thing, it is also interesting that Shakespeare and Pocahontas were alive during the same time period, that's neat.",Surprised
747," They definitely aren't two people I imagine in the same time period, and one ended up writing so many stories while the other inspired a lot of them, like the Pocahontas movies.",Curious to dive deeper
747," It's also neat that Shakespeare is the one that coined the phrase,"" Wild Goose Chase"" and the phrase ""Good riddance"", who would have thought that! ",Surprised
747,He really had a clever way with words. I wish I could hear some of his writings in the original accents to better understand the puns and rhymes from those days.,Neutral
747," True, that would be interesting.  They say that there wasn't much record keeping that was found when he passed away.",Surprised
747,Oh.,Neutral
747," I see that polish composer Andre Tchaikowsky donated his own skull to the Shakespeare company, hoping that it would be used as a prop in the Skull of Yorick, and it was!",Surprised
747,I think it's fantastically creepy that they use a real skull as a prop. I wonder what kind of props they'll be using in the Faction of Fools and WSC Avant Bard events!,Surprised
747," Wow, true!  ",Neutral
748,I recently read that some scientist theorize that universes evolve through natural selection (AKA survival of the fittest) like species on earth.  I wonder how that is possible considering universes do not have the same attributes as living creatures.,Curious to dive deeper
748,Well the universe is made up of planets right. So the bigger planets suck the smaller ones in and consume them.,Happy
748," So those with the strongest gravitational fields win?  I guess with dark matter, anything is possible.  What about the theory that the universe may be one giant superhologram?  Seems too farfetched.  if I am in a superhologram, then why do I bleed if I am not real?",Curious to dive deeper
748,I am with you there. I dont think we are living in a hologram,Happy
748," There are some weird concepts out there, like the theory of only one electron in the universe.  I can't see anyone believing that one.  After all, electricity is excited electrons.  If only one electron exists, then we would not be having this electronic chat!",Surprised
748,Very true on that one as well.,Happy
748," Switching to something more tangible, have you seen any modern interpretations of Shakespeare?",Curious to dive deeper
748,I havnt but I have used som of the phrases he coined.,Happy
748," So have I and I have also unknowing named my daughter a Shakespearian name, Olivia.  Its amazing his impact outside of the performing arts!",Surprised
748," My daughter is named olivia as well, and I have a sister named jessica",Happy
748," At our local university, Univerity  of Louisiana, we have an ongoing series, ""The Othello Project"".  I went to one of the performances where Shakespeare was put to dance.  It was an interesting interpretation.  Are you into dance?",Curious to dive deeper
748,Not really. Did you know pocahontas was alive the same time as shakespeare,Happy
748," When I first heard that, I had to look it up to confirm.  I would have thought Shakespeare would have been older.  Two performing companies are putting on Shakespeare's Henry V which has French Lords kindling a campfire.  Others have adapted Shakespeare based in an underground gay club.  I am having trouble visualizing those,  Sometime these modern interpretations totally change Shakesspeare's intent!",Curious to dive deeper
748,I picture shakespeare sitting there in a big heavy victorian coat by a piano. With candles to light the room and he iswriting music with a quill.,Happy
748,The performance that I am most intrigued by is the one playing at Gallaudet University.  I am really intrigued how they would adapt Shakespeare to a deaf audience!,Surprised
748,Just a lot more dancing and gestures instead of words. I dont find that difficult to fathom.,Happy
748," Speaking of dance, I often find it interesting that persons you typically do not associate with dance are actually very good if not professional dancers.  Like Bruce Lee, the martial arts champion, who won a Honk Kong Cha-Cha championship!",Curious to dive deeper
748,I could see a martial artist to be good on his feet.,Happy
748," I could to, but martial arts is much more fluent and unpredictable since you are sparring and do not know your opponents next move.  Dance tends is choreographed and you are with a partner and not an opponent.  But, I guess dance in is our blood.  Babies spontaneous dance when they hear music and smile more when the lock onto the beat!",Neutral
748,All my kids have loved music. Even as babies they would nod their head when music was playing.,Happy
748,Mine too.  My youngest just decided she wants to try ballet.  Did you know Tupac danced ballet.  That's something that does not immediately fit with the image of a street rapper!,Surprised
748,Well ttyl.,Happy
749,I like Bill Murray but I can't agree that Kung Fu Hustle is the supreme achievement of modern comedy.,Neutral
749," Is Kung Fu Hustle a movie? If so, I've never seen it.",Curious to dive deeper
749," Yes.  It is a movie.  It is too dependent on physical humor for my tastes.  I liked ""The Jerk"" as my best comedy of my lifetime.",Neutral
749," I believe physical humor is one of the oldest forms of comedy, at least on film. In the days of silent movies, for example, slapstick made a lot of sense because it didn't require sound.",Neutral
749," Yes.  It was natural that slapstick was used then.  However, I just don't like it much.  What comedic movie have you enjoyed?",Curious to dive deeper
749," I guess I haven't seen that many, but I do sometimes watch comedy TV shows. Ever watch Third Rock from the Sun?",Neutral
749," Just a few times.  Of course, I did like Friends and Seinfeld in their times.  3rd Rock did make me laugh.  Do you subscribe to Netflix?",Curious to dive deeper
749," Third Rock actually beat out Seinfeld and Friends for a Golden Globe back in 1997. Yes, I do subscribe to Netflix! Funny I should mention 1997, because that's the same year Netflix was founded.",Neutral
749," It is something how Netflix has become a category killer.  Blockbuster was huge, could have bought Netflix for a song and now Blockbuster is no more.",Neutral
749," Yes, I read somewhere that one of the founders of Netflix was inspired to start the company after racking up $40 in late fees for a VHS rental!",Neutral
749,Those kinds of stories are amazing.  Years ago I read of a Sony chairman who invented The Walkman because he wanted to listen to music when he jogged.,Neutral
749,The cool thing about Netflix is all the shows it now produces. Have you ever seen Lilyhammer? It's the first series Netflix created.,Curious to dive deeper
749,No. But you are right about it becoming a production house.  They actually have a nominee for the Best Picture Academy Award this year.,Neutral
749," Yes, I heard that. Netflix does original series in many of the markets it's in. I guess you can watch Netflix in pretty much any country except for China, Syria, North Korea, and Crimea.",Neutral
749,Yep.  They recently raised prices too.  That is market power when one has over 130 million subscribers.,Neutral
749," Hulu did, too. But it still beats the price of a night at the movies in many cities. I wonder if Netflix still rents DVDs?",Curious to dive deeper
749,I think I read that they stopped the DVD service.  Fortunately for them streaming with big bandwidth is widely available.,Neutral
749,Yes. Did you know that Netflix and YouTube together account for half of peak internet traffic in North America. That's a lot of streaming video.,Curious to dive deeper
749," It sure is!  Speaking of movies, did you hear that Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman refused to promote the movie ""Se7en"" unless it had the ending that they agreed with?",Neutral
749," I did hear that, but I'm at a loss, because I don't know what Se7en is about. Is it a horror flick?",Curious to dive deeper
749,It is a murder mystery where the principles get in jeopardy.  It has a shocking ending.  I won't spoil it.  My wife has watched the movie several times.  I guess I will go now.  Enjoyed it.,Neutral
750,Hello - how are you doing today?,Curious to dive deeper
750,Hey not too bad yourself? Do you have any kids? It seems like March of the Penguins 2 would be a good movie to watch with them!,Neutral
750,Hello - I have two kids. I bet they would love that movie. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
750,Nice. None for me yet but never early to think about what to watch with them lol! I also like comedy films. I used to watch comedy central a lot. Surprising to hear they cancelled over 100 shows since being created in 1989!,Surprised
750,I love comedy films. Did you know Demetri Martin was accepted into Harvard Law but left out of boredom to pursue comedy?,Surprised
750," Wow I didn't know that. Lucky for him it worked out, what a smart guy. I also love Steve Carrel but his movie Evan Almighty wasn't great despite having a monster budget of 200 million!",Surprised
750,I agree. Did you know they make bromantic movies like Harold and Kumar and the Hangover?,Surprised
750,Haha yes I like those kinds of movies! And comedy is one of the oldest genres in film! Very timeless!,Happy
750,Yes! Ryan Stiles dropped out of high school to pursue a career in comedy.,Surprised
750,Very bold but glad it worked out for him! I love watching comedy specials on Netflix too. Netflix has a whopping 137 million total subscribers worldwide!,Surprised
750," Netflix is huge. From 9pm-12am, Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in North America.",Surprised
750,Wow that is so major! I love watching highly rated movies and netflix has over 150 movies available with a 100% rating on rotten tomatoes.,Surprised
750,Wow that's crazy. Netflix and YouTube together make up half of the peak internet usage in North America.,Surprised
750,Wow they are so powerful. They control so much. I would love to work for Netflix-they get paid to watch Netflix. Well some employees do at least.,Happy
750,That would be awesome to get paid to watch Netflix. They actually spend 20 times more on postage than they do bandwidth.,Surprised
750,Oh interesting. In some European markets Netflix monitors illegal downloads to decide which shows to purchase. Quite a good idea.,Surprised
750,That is a good idea I think.,Curious to dive deeper
750,Yeah seems like it. I once saw that netflix had an hour long movie that is just a fireplace burning. Good for people with no fireplace!,Surprised
750,I saw that too lol. Netflix is now worth $2 billion.,Surprised
750,Wow so rich. I like watching Netflix movies with Morgan Freeman. He seems like a good guy and even financed a Mississippi town's prom in 2008.,Surprised
750,It was good talking to you!,Happy
751,Do you like watching movies?,Curious to dive deeper
751,Yes. What type of movie you prefer ?,Happy
751," I like fantasy movies, action movies, and comedy movies. What about you?",Curious to dive deeper
751,Comedy movie is my favourite it make stress free and happier also. The main aim of the film is to make the audience to laugh.,Happy
751,Comedy is great for laughs. I like the kinds that have happy endings more than black comedies.,Neutral
751,The origin was found in Greece. Mainly stand-up comedy is very famous it held at theatre also.,Happy
751," I have never seen comedy in theatres, but I would like to someday. Most of the comedy I watch is on TV. I use Netflix for a lot of it.",Curious to dive deeper
751,Comedy is divided into multiple genres based on the source of humor and the method of delivery. There are different form of comedy.,Happy
751," I like situational comedies the best, much more than slapstick. What's your favorite kind of comedy?",Curious to dive deeper
751,Stand-up comedy is my best and the way of delivering is also very good make me laugh.,Happy
751,Stand-up comedy is the best kind to see done live in a theater. I think it works better that way than it does in films.,Neutral
751,Yeah. Watching on live and make very humors also.,Surprised
751,Do you have a favorite comedy film? My favorite is Kung Fu Hustle.,Curious to dive deeper
751," 21 Jump street, hangover, Deadpool, The Dicator etc...",Happy
751," I loved Deadpool! It was one of the best superhero movies lately. The Hangover is funny too, one of the better bromantic comedy movies.",Happy
751,Laughing make free from stress and bring happier it also good for health. So only i watching it to free from worries also.,Happy
751," Movies are great to relieve stress and make me feel better, I agree. I sometimes even watch animated kid's comedy movies for fun because of that.",Neutral
751,Sometime i read comic books also. Netflix is a media service provider founded in 1997 which offers online streaming of a library of films and television programs.,Happy
751," I use Netflix a lot. It is amazing that it has over 137 million people who subscribe to it, and I am just one of those many!",Neutral
751,Please add I am also the next one. In US only 58.46 million subscriber for Netflix.,Happy
751,There are so many subscribers all over the world. It makes me want to go watch some movies on Netflix right now. I think I'll try one of the ones you suggested earlier. Thanks for chatting!,Happy
752," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
752," Good, do you watch many comedy movies?",Curious to dive deeper
752," I do, it is my favorite genre. What about you?",Curious to dive deeper
752," I'll watch just about anything, but comedy is good to watch with the kids.",Neutral
752,Agreed. It is better than being stuck watching 7500 episodes of pokemon.,Happy
752,I think one episode of Pokemon might be my limit.  Some one told me Common Sense media is a good way to find family friendly movies.,Neutral
752,I have not heard of that. Is that a popular thing?,Curious to dive deeper
752," It's for families looking for film that everyone can enjoy without offence.  March of the Penguins 2 and that kind of thing, basically a ratings website.",Neutral
752,Wow That seems like a good idea. Have you ever used it?,Curious to dive deeper
752," I father of one of my sons friends told me about it.  I'm usually aware of what it is movies, and, somewhat permissive, with what the kids can watch so I have not.  They might say Ghostbusters is too scary, but I just let the kids watch it.",Neutral
752,I have a really sensitive 7 year old and he would lose sleep over it. He was afraid of the beast in beauty and the beast. HA!,Happy
752," I used to be scarred of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, took me a long time to see it.  I'll stick with Bill Murray movies.",Fearful
752," He does like the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy, Kung Fu Hustle.",Surprised
752," I'm hoping that was a joke, I understand that is not a good movie.  I tend to use Netflix to see my movies now, rarely get to the movie house.",Neutral
752,Me too! I find the movie house too expensive. I like to watch on my couch and fall asleep too!,Curious to dive deeper
752," That's me, I miss about 30% of everything we watch.  I've been on the couch as my wife has watched every episode of Game of Thrones, I saw about three hours worth. ",Sad
752,Ha! How can you fall asleep for Game of Thrones though? That show is so good!,Curious to dive deeper
752," Just tired at the end of the day.  Even things I want to watch on Netflix I pass out to.  Usually because it's getting close to 12am, which is when Netflix uses 33% of all of America's bandwidth.",Sad
752," Between netflix and youtube, they use half of peak internet usage!",Surprised
752," Just watched that Se7en movie, not with the kids to reassure you, I'd forgotten about the ending, shocking.",Fearful
752,I still am shocked. Nice chatting with you!,Surprised
753,hey did you know that Panda researches sometimes wear panda costumes to work? haha,Curious to dive deeper
753,No.  I did not.,Neutral
753," haha it's so interesting. I played videogames as a kid, I guess the NES could only display 54 colors which I never realized as a kid",Surprised
753," I know.  Now TVs display millions of colors.  Speaking of entertainment, Caesar was surprised in 50 BC that Brits raised chickens for entertainment.",Neutral
753," haah that is wild, also crazy that the NES came out in 1985 and was finally discontinued in 2003 in Japan",Surprised
753,That is a short product life.  That is happening more and more in our tech age.  I suppose those Brits fought chickens which is illegal in lots of places now.,Neutral
753," ya I never understood having animals fight like that, I would rather eat them, chicken sounds tasty right now haha",Curious to dive deeper
753," I agree.  Lots of wings will be eaten Sunday when a lot of people will look to the Super Bowl for entertainment.  Trump will talk before it.  Reagan was once rejected for a role because he did not look ""Presidential""",Neutral
753," wow that is crazy, speaking of caesar, I guess the romans saw people who wore pants as barbarians simply for wearing pants",Surprised
753,Yes.  Now wearing a toga means you're going to a party. hahaha  One can fight on horseback better when wearing pants.,Neutral
753," haha that is true, I can't believe I never noticed that Aladdins pants were based on M C Hammer's, it seems so obvious now haha",Surprised
753,True.  How about a frivolous lawsuit about pants.  A judge of all people sued a cleaners for $67 million over the loss of a pair of pants.,Neutral
753," haha that is very silly, I wonder how important these pants were, also funny there is a city with a law that prohibits ""saggy pants"" thats funny",Surprised
753,Lawmakers with too much time on their hands  I saw the series Firefly (one season only) and their pants and other costumes were leftover from Starship Troopers.,Neutral
753," ah that is interesting, I liked Starship Troopers a lot, I'll have to checkout Firefly even though I know its not a similar product, I do like that Johnny Depp makes surprise appearances of Captain Jack Sparrow though",Happy
753," That is true charity.  I now think more of Depp.  Some costumes describe clothing for particular activities, but sometimes those are just uniforms.",Neutral
753," have you seen the lord of the rings? Sean bean usually plays a bad guy and a confident dude, but he is apparently afraid of flying ",Surprised
753,Angelina Jolie's proportions made it difficult for the director to decide how to frame the shots when she played Lara Croft,Neutral
753," ha that is crazy, I remember when it came out, I tried to watch it but I thought the movie was really bad, have you seen it?",Curious to dive deeper
753," A long time ago.  The new Lara has 20 pairs of boots for different purposes like running, looking tall and climbing rocks.",Neutral
753," haha that is crazy, I know there was a new Lara movie, I haven't seen it but I heard it was bad",Curious to dive deeper
754,Do you like wearing costumes?,Curious to dive deeper
754,i dont usually like to wear costumes. You?,Neutral
754," I like wearing them yeah, Panda researches wear them every time maybe I can become one. ",Curious to dive deeper
754,I wonder what that costume smells like after a day with the pandas.,Neutral
754,Maybe it has an AC unit inside lol but it must have a strange raw smell,Curious to dive deeper
754,I would want that things washed every day. I guess researchers have their own standards of hygiene.,Neutral
754," I guess they do, probably not a good idea to share costumes lol. Johnny Depp wears his Capt. Sparrow costume to cheer up kids in hospitals",Curious to dive deeper
754," He is great! i bet the kids love him, and the hospital staff really appreciates it too.",Neutral
754," I bet they do, who doesn't like Captain Jack Sparrow lol, Depp is a great actor",Curious to dive deeper
754,He is versatile. i liked him in Ninth Gate.,Neutral
754," Yeah he can play just about any role, do you like Lord of the Rings, do you recall who Sean Bean is?",Curious to dive deeper
754," Yes, i remember him. he played the guy who died in the first film.",Neutral
754," He did, well he was so scared of flying he hiked in full costume when they filmed the movie. ",Curious to dive deeper
754," Whoa. that is serious. i am not scared of flying, but i dont like heights. he could go on horseback?",Neutral
754," I have no idea of how he got there but yeah maybe on the back of a horse, ",Curious to dive deeper
754,that would be a long trip. and his costume must have been stinky with sweat and stuff.,Neutral
754,Yeah I bet so what other forms of entertainment do you like?,Curious to dive deeper
754,I used to play video games. i dont play now. You?,Neutral
754," I used to play them as well, I dont have the time anymore I had a NES system growing up",Curious to dive deeper
754,I never had the NES. my friend did. he played it a lot. he loved Mario.,Neutral
754," Mario is a great game and also one of my favorites I also had a Nintendo 64, Mario Party was the best game anyways its been cool chatting today",Curious to dive deeper
754," I tried mario cart in the arcade. that was fun. Yes, great chat!",Neutral
754," It was a fun game, one of the most popular as well, hope you have a nice day bye. ",Curious to dive deeper
755," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
755,Hello. I am doing good. How are you?,Curious to dive deeper
755," I am well, thanks. Are you a fan of tomb raider?",Curious to dive deeper
755,I am a fan of tomb raider.,Happy
755,I like how the franchise has been sexed down. I felt bad for it when it came out the first time.,Sad
755,I prefer the video game myself. I got the game that came out in 2013.,Happy
755,I feel bad for the actress who had to play her in the video game. Sexism.,Curious to dive deeper
755,I didn't think about sexism or anything like that. I just liked playing the game.,Neutral
755," OK, so maybe I am over thinking this. Let's relax it a little. Did you know the uniforms worn by the alliance on firefly were left over from starship troopers?",Surprised
755,No. I did not know that.,Surprised
755," Well, if you are ever a panda researcher, I hope you are into role-play because panda researchers wear the costume.",Happy
755,I find it funny that Hugh Jackman wore his Wolverine costume at Comic Con and nobody noticed him. Everyone is dressed up there though. So I guess it makes sense.,Neutral
755," I wear the wolverine costume on a daily basis. Is that weird? Like Johnny Depp traveling with jack sparrow? Oh wait, that's super cute.",Happy
755,Well when I was in high school people called me Wolverine a few times because I kept a big beard.,Happy
755,It wasn't because of the antimantium skeleton?,Curious to dive deeper
755,Nope. All because of the beard. It's amazing what a beard can do. Did you know the Hulk has indestructible pants?,Happy
755,I did not. How strange!,Surprised
755,It's one of his super powers. I think it's strange too.,Happy
755,It was great chatting with you!,Happy
755,You too. Thanks so much for chatting with me.,Happy
755,Have a great night!,Happy
756," hi, do you like costumes and uniforms?",Curious to dive deeper
756," I do actaully, I wear them for halloween mostly, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
756,yeah from time to time. do you know who the starship troopers are?,Curious to dive deeper
756," oh ya I saw that movie, its pretty violent I liked it though, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
756," yeah I have seen it too, apparently their clothes were wore by the alliance on firefly",Curious to dive deeper
756," ah interesting, have you played any games by Blizzard entertainment btw?",Surprised
756," I have actually not, have you?",Curious to dive deeper
756," I have, they made games like world of warcraft and starcraft, have you heard of those?",Curious to dive deeper
756," oh cool, yeah have heard but have not played. did you ever play nintendo?",Curious to dive deeper
756," I did, I played the NES and all their systems, what bout yoU?",Curious to dive deeper
756,yeah me too. they only had 54 colors,Curious to dive deeper
756," you know what is weird, that the nfl is classified as an ""entertainment"" business and not a sport, in the legal sense",Surprised
756,yeah that is strange. do you like wearing trousers?,Curious to dive deeper
756," haha I do I'm wearing some ""long trousers"" right now, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
756,yeah they are so comfortable. there is a law that prohibits saggy pants in collinsville,Curious to dive deeper
756," huh that seems weird, also weird is how the hulk has indestructible pants, but I guess that makes sense when he is always transforming!",Surprised
756,hahha yeah otherwise he would have to buy lots of pants,Curious to dive deeper
756,what is werid to me is that it was illegal for women to wear pants in paris until 2013,Surprised
756,that is so strange. the romans saw them as a sign of barbarism,Curious to dive deeper
756," ya that is crazy, and its funny that in baseball umpires wear black underwear in case they have a split haha",Surprised
756,hahha that is funny. nice chat,Surprised
757,do you like colorful clothing?,Curious to dive deeper
757,I do just like the pilgrims prefer most of the time,Curious to dive deeper
757,Yes. Do you know when they wear black though?,Curious to dive deeper
757,Yes that is reserved for special occasions,Curious to dive deeper
757,Yeah. Do you know how they tell if you need your clothes tailored?,Curious to dive deeper
757,Yes they look for collar gaps in them,Curious to dive deeper
757,Yeah. Did you hear of that fun clothing store in Alabama with unclaimed stuff?,Curious to dive deeper
757,Yes it is all stuff that remains unclaimed in the airport,Curious to dive deeper
757,Yeah. Did you know North Korea has a clothing brand?,Curious to dive deeper
757,Yes the RIp Curl that says that it is made in China,Curious to dive deeper
757,So ironic. Even Apple used to have a clothing line,Curious to dive deeper
757,Yes that was in 1986 but it is gone now,Curious to dive deeper
757,Yeah. Do you have a favorite kind of shoes?,Curious to dive deeper
757,I like trainers. Did you know balled dancers use up to 4 pairs of shoes a week?,Curious to dive deeper
757,That sounds like a lot of shoes and also a lot of money,Curious to dive deeper
757,True. 5000 old shoes are better than they are nowadays,Curious to dive deeper
757,Wow. DO you know how to keep your shoes fresh?,Curious to dive deeper
757,Yes you can use tea bags and put them in the shoes,Curious to dive deeper
757,Yeah. Do you know how Steve Smith is raising awareness for homelessness?,Curious to dive deeper
757,Yes he leaves his cleats in the field after the games,Curious to dive deeper
757,Such a great approach. Nice chat tonight,Happy
758," Hi, how are you?",Happy
758," Doing alright, did you know a google search requires more computing power that it took to send people to the moon?",Curious to dive deeper
758," Wow, that's impressive.  Technology has came a long way!",Surprised
758," Yea google has grown a lot since it was launched, now it has cloud computing and online advertising technologies",Neutral
758,All started by a couple of college kids. Worth billions now.,Happy
758," Yea, it's crazy how much people rely on google, in 2013 google took 40% of web traffic when it went down",Neutral
758," I believe it, we're a society hooked on technology.  Just yesterday, Facebook and Instagram went down in the afternoon and people were going bonkers.",Surprised
758," Yea, it's pretty bad now, plus these websites mine people's data to do things like calculate traffic on Google maps",Neutral
758," Yes, which is kind of creepy to me! Say, if the CIA or whoever wanted to knock you off they know exactly where to find you! Makes me wish for the days of the old flip phones.",Fearful
758,Yea plus you can find yourself in trouble if you rely on google maps since they tailor disputed countries to the claims of each country depending on which country you are in,Neutral
758,I guess they are trying to be politically correct.  Technology does have its drawbacks at times.,Sad
758," Yea, if I'm ever in the South China sea I'm not going to rely on google maps, don't want to cause an international incident with China and Japan",Neutral
758,Exactly!  Wonder if they're still using goats to mow their grass around their headquarters?,Curious to dive deeper
758,Probably cheaper just to have someone use a lawn mower instead of dealing with all the regulations and upkeep of keeping goats around,Neutral
758," They should have googled it.  They would have found all that out beforehand.  Plus, the fact that live goats STINK!",Happy
758," That is true,speaking of stuff that stinks there is a store in alabama that sells unclaimed airport baggage",Neutral
758,That's probably where my red suitcase full of my shoes got sent in 1995.,Surprised
758,Maybe somewhere in Alabama you have a fashion twin,Neutral
758," Maybe, LOL. I hear the pilgrims always wore colorful clothes unless it was a special occasion, then they wore black.  I never saw them in anything but black and white, have you?",Curious to dive deeper
758," No but all the Pilgrim paintings I saw were at Thanksgiving, I guess that counts as a special occasion",Neutral
758," That's true, too! Well, nice chatting with you, enjoy your day.",Happy
758,You too,Neutral
759,Good evening!  With the new year upon us it's time for resolutions and one of mine is to save money.  How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
759," My new years resolution is too eat healthy.  Yeah,  saving money is like an all time goal I have.  Any good tips?",Curious to dive deeper
759," One tip is what they call a food fast.  Essentially you eat everything in your house before you can go to the store (except for eggs, milk, bread, and other perishables.) ",Happy
759,I have been doing that for the last month actuall.  Its amazing what you can make when You think you have no food lol.,Curious to dive deeper
759,Impressive!  We are looking at trying something like a 21-day financial fast where you are limited to necessary purchases only.  I need to start looking at subscriptions to cancel. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
759," I cancelled all my subscriptions in November last year,  even Nextflix!  lol Oh except amazon prime....thats life!  I need that.  I had a bunch that I didnt need though,  clothing subscription,  audible,  etc. ",Curious to dive deeper
759," I think Prime might be necessary, but I know that cost is going up.  If only I had Google's money! ",Sad
759," lol yeah,  Right!! A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send neil armstrong and eleven other astronauts to the moon",Curious to dive deeper
759," Just think, Google maps determines traffic by the speed android devices are moving.  It's amazing what technology does these days.",Surprised
759," Yeah,  also,  a little scary because they got tabs on all the android phones!",Curious to dive deeper
759," Absolutely.  Also scary that when it went down for five minutes in 2013, just a little under half of the web traffic went down too!",Fearful
759," Thats insane!  I love this fun fact: Instead of hiring people to mow the lawns around their headquarters, google once used hundreds of live goats.",Curious to dive deeper
759," Would love to know how cost effective that would be, but surprised the leader in cloud computing, software, and hardware, would do that.",Neutral
759,Ive seen it done at other places too.  I think its great!  No clue on how cost effective it is though.,Curious to dive deeper
759," A bit of a change of pace, but all this talk of being cost effective made me think of a store in Alabama that only sells clothes and other items unclaimed at airports.",Surprised
759," what do you think about it?  I think its a good idea,  they are just going to throw it away",Curious to dive deeper
759," I'm not Mr. Environment, but I am all for reusing things and that is a great way.",Happy
759," There are a lot of great tips in this article,  I also am in the process of doing the no shopping tip as well,  which is extremely hard,  but I am noticing the amount of money I save.   its only been 2 weeks but yeah big difference",Curious to dive deeper
759," I've got to make a list.  We cut away on a lot, but it's that extra credit card debt that looms large.",Disgusted
759," Oh I hear ya!  Thats what I am gonna use this extra money for,  that christmas shpping that is still on my cc lol ",Curious to dive deeper
759," Need to run, but thanks for chatting!",Happy
760," Hi, I am astonished, I didn't know that there are stars so cold that we can touch them with our hands, incredible!",Surprised
760,That is crazy! I sure wish I could hold a cold star my hand right now haha. have you heard the theory that the universe is just a giant hologram?,Curious to dive deeper
760," Yes, I have heard about it. The question is that the more we investigate the universe, the more incredible results. And what about the theory that there is only one electron in the universe, and all of the electrons that we have observed?",Curious to dive deeper
760," That is another interesting Theory. I know that Elon Musk believes in the Hologram Theory. So that makes more sense to me, I don't even know how the one electron in the universe theory would work. Do you think that there is a region of space that's pulling galaxies apart?",Curious to dive deeper
760," Yes, I think so, it looks like the Universe is hugeeeeee! Is interesting too, to know that Universes evolve with natural selection, like species here in Earth. ",Curious to dive deeper
760," That is interesting. They need to put that in a TV show, and have battling universes LOL. It's cool that scientific models of the universe were created by Greek and Indian philosophers, and put Earth at the center, and today of course we know that the sun is at the center",Curious to dive deeper
760," Yes, what I wonder is about the flat earthers theory, I guess they could think too that the Sun is still is around the Earth. It has been a long way of studies in order to bring us were we are now.",Curious to dive deeper
760," Yes I agree with you. Did you ever watch that show that showed the Universe? I forgot what it was called. But it has a good celebrity who would narrate it, do you like any celebrities by the way?",Curious to dive deeper
760," Cosmos. I am old enough, with Carl Sagan. I liked him, yes, I like some celebrities, Alec Baldwin, Michael Jackson, Meryl Streep, De Niro, Carol Burnett, Robin Williams, that happened to be the voice of Aladdin. And you?",Curious to dive deeper
760," Yep you're right haha. Yeah I like Robin Williams, Michael Jackson, Michael Caine, Al Pacino, I guess I have a lot too. do you think Robin Williams ever got to visit the secret Pixar celebrity room?",Curious to dive deeper
760," I guess so. He was really famous and I think he could disguised himself and not to be stuck in the same role. Do you like to go over there? I don't know if Carol Burnett has been there, though. Perhaps they just take young celebrities.",Curious to dive deeper
760," And Carol Burnett was the first celebrity on Sesame Street right? Do you know what other shows she did, I think that was before my time so I've never heard of her before",Curious to dive deeper
760," Oh, she had her own show, I used to watched her, she was hilarious, but really hillarious, it was the Carol Burnett Show, with Lyle Wagoneer and others, she had one or two episodes that it killed you. In one she was mimicking Esther Williams, entered to the pool and when she came out, she was taking out alive fish from her cleavage, so funny!  Do you like country music?",Curious to dive deeper
760," Country music is ok. It's not my favorite but I can listen to it. I think it's so weird that Henry Ford helped to finance it, he was worried about the""Urban decadence of jazz music but I don't know what that means",Surprised
760," Well, he didn't like jazz, looks like. I am not a huge fan of country music, but I certainly like the instruments that they use, acoustic guitars, stell guitars, harmonicas, and they have different ways to use it for, by singing happily, dancing or the crying ones.",Curious to dive deeper
760," Well it's interesting to me, because I play guitar, that this Fender Stratocaster was actually intended for country music, it's definitely not that way today",Surprised
760," Oh, I have always wanted to play guitar, perhaps one day. I didn´t know that the famous U2 started playing with disguises in Galveston TExas,as the Dalton brothers! the lengths people go to make it!",Curious to dive deeper
760," No I didn't know that!  I wish that we could touch them in concert, but they use disguises so yeah you would never know. Haha.  Also interesting is that only two black people are in the Country Music Hall of Fame.",Surprised
760," Oh, I bet!  But Country music has a lot of origins, it is a blend of Irish, Celtic, English ballads, cowboy songs, etc. I always thought that it was just from the Southeast of USA!",Curious to dive deeper
760," That's what I thought too! I know sometimes people call it quote Hillbilly music quote but I think that's a derogatory term personally, like you said, it encompasses so much more than that.",Surprised
760," Yes, I have heard it as a Hillbilly, well, you always will find somebody trying to feel superior to others, I am giving you an excellent, thank you, you were great!",Happy
760," Thank you you've been excellent as well and make sure to check out George Strait, I guess he's cousins with Jeff Bezos, I can only imagine that they're both loaded haha.",Happy
761,Hi. Do you like country music?,Curious to dive deeper
761," Yes, I do like country music what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
761,I do too. Country became popular in the 1940's after being called hillbilly music since the 1920's.,Surprised
761,I like the music by George Strait I think he was a great musician.,Curious to dive deeper
761,Jeff Bezos is his cousin!,Surprised
761," Thats interesting! to think one of the wealthiest man and a country legend are family, that family must be full with talent.",Curious to dive deeper
761,Seriously! The fender stratocaster was intended for country music.,Surprised
761," That is a nice piece of instrumentation, it doesnt seem like a good combination now, did you know U2 started out playing country music?",Curious to dive deeper
761,I heard they opened up for themselves at a few shows disguised in costumes!,Surprised
761," That would be interesting to watch, it makes you think kind of like the universe and the many theories it came to be.",Curious to dive deeper
761,There is a theory that there is only one electron in the universe.,Surprised
761,Do you believe that one to be true? I incline myself over the one that the universe may be a giant superhologram.,Curious to dive deeper
761,It all sounds bizarre to me!,Surprised
761," Yeah, I guess well never really know, an interesting theory is the Big Bang theory, or the one of the multiverses.",Curious to dive deeper
761,I agree. There are stars that are cold enough to touch with the human hand.,Surprised
761,That is an interesting fact! to think the sun might reach that temperature someday.,Curious to dive deeper
761,Yes. There are scientists who theorize that universes evolve through natural selection much like different species do on earth.,Surprised
761," Oh I see, but anyway, are you a movie person? I hear the other day that Pixar studios has a secret room that only celebrities have access to.",Curious to dive deeper
761,That sounds neat! Robin williams in aladdin was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films.,Surprised
761," I see, I thought it all began with Shrek lol its crazy how much Judge Judy maker per episode.",Curious to dive deeper
761," $123,000!! Incredible",Surprised
761," I know! it seems like a lot of money, havent really watch Judge Judy before.",Surprised
762,How do you feel about the conservative vs. liberal  press coverage?,Neutral
762,I think that it is unfairly biased towards the liberal side.  I know that the liberals think it is unfairly biased to the conservative side though.,Neutral
762," I tend to think it is a bit unbiased to the conservatives, but I am a moderate in a very ultra conservative area, so that might influence my decision.",Neutral
762,I've heard that some liberals complain that even the entertainment industry is biased towards conservatives.,Neutral
762," I wouldn't agree with that.  I think the entertainment industry is fairly balanced, if not balanced towards the liberals.",Curious to dive deeper
762,I think it is more balanced towards the liberals as well.  If you think about what each side stands for and then what is reflected in movies and tv shows it's kind of obvious how they lean.,Neutral
762," Very true.  I have a hard time with any Mainstream Media these days.  Each side has their channels, but it is so slanted.  It has gotten hard to get the facts as they are.",Neutral
762," Yes it has.  A person has to search google and look up various sources just to find out the facts. And then there is the stories covered, so many are unimportant these days but made to seem important.  Our universe is so much larger than what the media shows us.",Neutral
762,It really is.  There is so much trivial coverage of things too.  I dont particularly care whose dog got photographed or what the celebrities are up to.  Share stories of people changing the world.,Neutral
762,I totally agree with you!  They should tell the public that scientists think we are already in a black hole for example.,Neutral
762," I had heard that on a podcast I listen to recently.  They should also report on the status of cancer research, and Alzheimers research.  Promote events that help the world.",Neutral
762,Yes they should.  They need to report facts on events that are relevant to people and their lives.  I would like more information on the possible link found to a parallel universe. That seems pretty relevant.,Neutral
762," It does, they should also talk about how universes evolve, just like earth species do.  ",Neutral
762,True.  Do you think it is interesting that we still don't know how large the universe is?,Neutral
762,Yeah.  I think it is really an unfathomable size.  It is constantly expanding outward.  We dont even know where the center of the universe it.  (Although we often think we are it... we arent..),Curious to dive deeper
762,That's true.  Nicolaus Copernicus put the sun as the center and others built on that but we don't actually know for certain.,Neutral
762," It is center of our solar system, but who hows how many galaxies there are out there.  Ours isnt even the largest.",Neutral
762," Along the lines of the universe being inside a black hole, I had been under the impression that a black hole was the center of the universe.",Neutral
762," It could be.  We dont truly know.  I think exploriation is so important.  I tend to believe that there is life other than us out there.  What if there is something more complex, thinking we arent intelligent life forms?",Curious to dive deeper
762,As long as they look at our media they probably will think that.,Neutral
762," Very true, especially our social media.  LOL",Neutral
762,Here's something I would like to know how scientists know.  They say that if you fold a paper in half 103 times it would be as thick as the universe.,Neutral
763," Hi, do you like music?",Curious to dive deeper
763,Hey there I do like music. What kind of music do you like? The only kind I don't like is country LOL,Curious to dive deeper
763,I like them all I think. I think country has become very popular though. Do you know where it originated?,Curious to dive deeper
763,No I don't can you tell me more? I do know that I use Amazon and Jeff Bezos and George Strait are cousins somehow haha that is weird,Curious to dive deeper
763,Yeah talk about a small world. It originated in the US in 1920s,Curious to dive deeper
763,Yep interesting. I guess sometimes people call it Hillbilly music. That sounds very offensive haha. I guess in 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio station in the United States,Surprised
763," I am not surprised a lot of people like it. There are only two African Americans in the hall of fame for country music though, strange ",Curious to dive deeper
763,That is strange. I wonder why that is? Did you hear that Henry Ford helped to popularize country music,Surprised
763,Yeah but only out of fear that jazz would take over. Wonder how much he spent there,Curious to dive deeper
763,Yep I wonder that too. He was a worried about the Takeover of Urban decadence in terms of jazz. I guess he didn't have to worry because Jazz certainly didn't take over,Surprised
763," Yeah, that is true. Did you hear U2 once opened for themselves and were under disguise?",Curious to dive deeper
763,That is funny. I wonder if they did any original songs? Like do they do midnight shows as country music stars and we just don't know it LOL do you know how to play a guitar by the way?,Curious to dive deeper
763,I actually do not. Have you ever seen Sesame STreet?,Curious to dive deeper
763,I have seen Sesame Street. Wasn't Carol Burnett the first celebrity to appear on that show?,Curious to dive deeper
763,Yeah that is exactly right. Did you know Robin Williams was the voice of Aladdin?,Curious to dive deeper
763,I did know that. He did the voice of the genie. And I guess he started a trend in celebrities doing the voice acting in these animated movies,Surprised
763,Yeah it seems. Do you know who is the highest and second highest paid celebrity?,Curious to dive deeper
763,I think the highest paid celebrity is Judge Judy right? Who is the highest paid celebrity?,Curious to dive deeper
763,Yeah the only one to get paid more is LeBron James,Curious to dive deeper
763," Oh that makes sense. And yes I think Judge Judy makes about $123,000 per episode. Which is still insane!",Surprised
763," That is so much money, it is crazy. Nice chatting with you :)",Happy
764,Hi would you like to chat?,Curious to dive deeper
764," I can't think of anything better to do, can you tell me about animal, or poetry, or animals that read poetry?",Curious to dive deeper
764," Well, I can tell you that there are about 20 Quintilian animals on planet earth.",Curious to dive deeper
764," Did you count them personally?  I hate it when you are counting and someone interrupts, making you lose count.  I can't quite picture that number of animals",Happy
764," No, I started counting them but my magic marker ran out of ink and I lost track.",Happy
764," I love that the Loch Ness monster is protected by the government.  It, or he, or she, has been doing fine for millennia without the government.",Surprised
764,I think we should protect big foot too. I think it makes perfect sense to protect something that we don't know exists.,Happy
764," It sounds as though the Germans are going down that path, animals there have guaranteed rights.  I wonder if they have access to lawyers to enact those rights.",Surprised
764,I read that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when domesticated. I think human are animals but they don't have white patches.,Curious to dive deeper
764," Good point, you should find the researcher and put that to them.  I've heard that before, I think it's the same with floppy ears like you get on dogs.  And don't say humans don't have floppy ears.",Happy
764," They do, I've seen some people with ears so big they couldn't lean out the window of a moving car because their ears would beat them to death.",Happy
764," I was going to ask if you have a computer, but considering what we're doing it would be a redundant question.",Curious to dive deeper
764," Ha! No actually I don't have a computer, I am projecting images to you telepathically. I am also quite crazy.",Happy
764," Have you heard of these transhumanists who want to load themselves on to memory sticks?  My kids keep taking my sticks, I'd hate to be overwritten by some school project.",Fearful
764,I have heard about that. But I don't really get the point.,Neutral
764," I suppose it's a eternal life thing, doesn't seem like much of a life floating around a memory stick.  I guess you could program a world to exist in.  I may be no expert but I don't see it coming to reality.",Sad
764," Kind of sounds like the movie. It's on the tip of my tongue, but my brain crashed.",Curious to dive deeper
764," Wasn't Johnny Depp in it Transcendance , or something? We sure have come a long way from the Russians 1936 computer that ran on water.",Surprised
764," That might apply, but I was thinking about the Matrix. We live in amazing times. I can't wait to see what they come up with in the next ten years.",Curious to dive deeper
764," Of course The Matrix, just like me to miss the obvious.  Whatever they come with don't smoke near it, it will just like with Apple and invalidating your warranty.",Sad
764,I wonder how they would prove that. Would they swab the device for signs of nicotine?,Curious to dive deeper
764," At Apple they will have the iSwab to do that, just like any other swab, just more expensive.  Good chatting with you, have a good evening",Happy
764,Thanks. Good chatting with you and you have a good evening also.,Neutral
765," Have you seen ""To All the Boys I've loved before?""  It's a hit over the summer on Netflix.",Curious to dive deeper
765," NO I have not seen it, but it seems quite popular, it may have a trilogy. ",Neutral
765," Netflix had a few successes with putting out romantic comedies recently with ""The Kissing Booth"" being popular.",Happy
765," I have heard that Netflix is more ""Nice"" movies instead of doing satire. ",Neutral
765,Interestingly in To All the Boys I've Loved Before all the letters got delivered to the girls door,Surprised
765," Yeah, it is also a Netflix original, surprisingly they still send DVD with mail. ",Surprised
765,Many blockbuster movies are out there.  Peter Kavinsky is becoming popular on the internet,Happy
765,Yeah he is one of Netflix's stars. They promote him on their Twitter feed.,Neutral
765,He is handsome and athletic also intelligent helping him along,Curious to dive deeper
765," He is popular but I doubt he will become as popular as Robert De Niro, he is in 8 of the top 250 movies in IMDB. ",Neutral
765,Did you know that Ryan Stiles dropped out of high school to make a career in comedy?,Surprised
765,What movies did he filmed ?,Neutral
765," I'm not sure.  But, 3rd rock from the sun won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997",Curious to dive deeper
765," They did beat Seinfeld and Friends, yet few people remember this show. ",Sad
765,I faintly remember it but don't remember it being so great,Surprised
765," It is difficult to create comedy that pass the test of time, like Seinfeld. ",Neutral
765," Yes, Harrison Ford is a great icon.  He and Robert de Niro share the lead for most film appearances in the imdb top 250 at 8.",Curious to dive deeper
765,And Wal-Mart released a film that IMDB consider the worst film produced in the 2000s.,Neutral
765," They need to stick to business, not show business I guess.  Shawshank redemption grossed only $3 million more than its budget even though rated highest on imdb",Surprised
765," It is difficult to create a blockbuster, that is why Netflix is spending so much. In the billions. ",Neutral
765," Yes, but they seem to be doing well",Neutral
766,Hey there! Are you interested in poetry at all?,Curious to dive deeper
766," Not too much, but I know a bit, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
766,Same- I think its really amazing that it has such an extensive history though. I was reading a few interesting things about it. Did you know Edgar Allan Poe only made $9 when The Raven was published?,Curious to dive deeper
766," That is not very much at all, how much is that 9 dollars in todays value?",Curious to dive deeper
766," I'm not sure, but I can't imagine its very much, especially considering how well-known that poem is now! ",Surprised
766," That is true, did you know poetry was once an olympic sport?",Curious to dive deeper
766,Really? Was it a sport to write the poetry or to read it out loud?,Curious to dive deeper
766," I am not sure, Art and music were also sports as well",Curious to dive deeper
766," That's pretty cool! I would love to find out more about how that worked. Did you know that the javanese alphabet forms a poem when recited in order? I haven't heard it, but I wonder what it sounds like!",Surprised
766," that is really interesting, languages intrigue me, how big is their alphabet?",Curious to dive deeper
766," I'm not sure- language is really fascinating! Or really communication in general, there are so many different types and ways of going about it! Did you know that there are 20 quintillion individual animals on our planet? Random, but thinking of different types of communication brought that to mind. ",Curious to dive deeper
766," that is a ton of animals, holy moly, i know we have over 1.5 million species though",Surprised
766," I didn't know that! Did you know one of the signs of a domesticated animal are white patches on its forehead? I haven't noticed that consistently, but I'm going to look for it more often now!",Neutral
766,Why is that the case?,Curious to dive deeper
766,I'm not sure! I was wondering the same thing. And I wonder if its only newly domesticated animals versus species like dogs or cats that have been domesticated over time?,Curious to dive deeper
766," I am not too sure either, I know animals have dominant appendages, like we do for our right or left hand",Curious to dive deeper
766,I've never heard that before- how do you tell which is dominant? And do they have dominant appendages in both the front and back or just one?,Curious to dive deeper
766," that much I do not know, they also have different dialects or languages based on geography",Curious to dive deeper
766,Really? So a dog from Europe would bark differently than a dog from the US? Did yo know that germany was the first country to give animals legal rights?,Curious to dive deeper
766," I think that is what it means! I did not know that, that is awesome of them though!",Curious to dive deeper
766,Yeah! It was nice chatting with you!,Happy
767,Do you like computers?,Curious to dive deeper
767,For the most part. I work in part with computers!,Curious to dive deeper
767,I think a lot of people do these days. What about Apple computers?,Curious to dive deeper
767,My wife has one and I used to. smokinh near one voids the warranty.,Curious to dive deeper
767," That is so weird, right? I wonder if it is the same with iphones? ",Curious to dive deeper
767,I hope not. I imagine people smoke more with their phone,Curious to dive deeper
767,That is true. Did you know in 1936 Russians made a computer that ran on water?,Curious to dive deeper
767,That's impressive. The space shuttles compute rused only 1MB of RAM. Must have been simple!,Curious to dive deeper
767,That is pretty cool. Makes you wonder what we need all of this computing power for then.,Curious to dive deeper
767,I'm also guessing that the space shuttle's computer wasnt asked to do alot. Did yo ukow there are mor than 20 quintillion animals individuakly on earth?,Curious to dive deeper
767,I didn't but that sounds about right. How many fish are there?,Curious to dive deeper
767,Probably a lot more than I think!,Curious to dive deeper
767," Yeah, I wonder if it is more or less, I'm guessing more!",Curious to dive deeper
767,Even the Loch Ness monster is protected in Scotland!,Curious to dive deeper
767," Hilarious! Well, you have to assume it is the national mascot. ",Curious to dive deeper
767,It is? Did not know that,Curious to dive deeper
767," I don't know, but you would assume so, right? ",Curious to dive deeper
767,Makes sense! Germanya lso gives animals constitutional rights,Curious to dive deeper
767," Yeah, I heard about that. Sort of crazy to think of things like that. Similar to what gills are. Well, nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
767,You too! I see that aniamls developed white patches to indicate domestication too,Curious to dive deeper
767," Yeah, I don't know if I believe that one! Good chatting. Take it easy!",Happy
768,Do you like to use computers? they are great tools,Curious to dive deeper
768,I do like them!  I rely on them to make money!,Happy
768," Yeah same here, cant believe the shuttles computer runs on only 1mb of ram",Surprised
768,Isn't that crazy something so small can power something so big?,Happy
768," I know right, its insane, it must be really difficult to upgrade that system 1mb seems primitive",Curious to dive deeper
768,It does.  In 1936 the Russians made a computer that ran on water.  I'm guessing they must have used something like a water wheel to generate a power system.,Happy
768," I think that didnt work our, we dont have many computers that run on water now a days but interesting concept.",Curious to dive deeper
768,Yes. lol  Someone built a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic minecraft building blocks.  I don't know how that works.,Happy
768," Sounds like a really smart person, what are your thoughts on trans-humanists ",Fearful
768,I kind of like the idea of being able to upload your mind to a computer and memory sticks because you would be leaving some kind of legacy behind after you're gone.,Happy
768," It is an interesting concept, maybe they will upload their minds successfully, that will ensure survival of our race.",Curious to dive deeper
768,Yes.  Do you know much about animals?  I love them.,Happy
768,I know that there are 7 million species and 20 quintillion of them,Curious to dive deeper
768,Whoa!  Animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated.  Interesting.,Happy
768,That is interesting! I have a dog and haven't noticed that. Maybe he's not domesticated fully yet.,Curious to dive deeper
768," LOL that's great!  Under the provisions of the 1912 Scottish protection of animals act, the Loch Ness monster is a protected species!",Happy
768,Thats fair. Why wouldn't you like to scare Nessie away if it ever appears again? Do you think that Nessie is real or just a myth?,Curious to dive deeper
768," I would like to think that it was real, but by now I would have thought if it did exist there would be some solid evidence.",Happy
768," I think its hard to tell but I hope Nessie exists, it must be an amazing beast. ",Curious to dive deeper
768,I would think so for sure!  Hiccups area a holdover from early evolution when early land animals had both gills and lungs!  It's been fun chatting!,Happy
768," I hate hiccups, they are so annoying! cool facts thanks for chatting and for sharing them with me, have a great day. ",Curious to dive deeper
769,Hello - how are you doing this morning?,Curious to dive deeper
769,I'm doing just swell! drinking my morning cup of coffee. how about you?,Neutral
769,I'm doing good - thanks for asking. Do you have a Netflix account?,Curious to dive deeper
769,doesnt everyone these days? haha,Neutral
769," Haha yea. From 9pm-12am, Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in North America.",Surprised
769," I believe it! I know thats when I get most of my Netflix watching done. and then all these kids nowadays with their ""Netflix and Chilling."" 9-12 is prime time for that",Neutral
769,I bet lol. Netflix and Youtube make up half the peak internet traffic in North America.,Surprised
769," and to think, Netflix started just because the founder racked up a big late fee on his VHS or Apollo 13!",Neutral
769,That is funny how someone became rich over something like that. Blockbuster declined to buy Netflix for $50 million and now they are worth $2 billion.,Surprised
769,and Blockbuster is dead. I kind of miss them though,Neutral
769,I do miss Blockbuster myself. I used to spend a lot of time up there growing up.,Happy
769," i did too. every friday night I was there renting a game and a movie! Now I can just do it from home. I used to rent a lot of comedy films, one of my favorite kinds to watch",Neutral
769,Do you like comedy films?,Curious to dive deeper
769," love em, one of my favorite genres. I could always use a good laugh. you?",Neutral
769," Me too! 3rd Rock from the Sun won a golden globe in 1997 and beat out Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier.",Surprised
769," I cant believe that. Those are 3 very highly regarded shows. Im sure 3rd rock is good and all, but not as iconic",Neutral
769,I agree. Did you know Bill Murray thinks Kung Fu Hustle is the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy?,Surprised
769," i did hear that, I think thats an odd choice. have you ever seen that movie?",Neutral
769,I have not seen that movie so I think it's odd as well.,Surprised
769,definitely not in the top 250 movies of all time. 16 of which feature either Harrison Ford or Robert De Niro. Theyre each in 8,Neutral
769,It was good talking to you!,Happy
770,Hi! Are you a Netflix user?,Happy
770," I am a Netflix user, what about yourself?",Curious to dive deeper
770," Yup. It's available worldwide, except for China, Syria, and North Korea. So, I should be good for a long time!",Happy
770,Yeah it was more than 137 million subscribers around the world so that tells you something about the success of the brand,Curious to dive deeper
770," Yeah, and with them in 2012 becoming content-production enterprise as well, they have solidified their long term success.",Happy
770," I heard they have a lot of debt too, did you know how Netflix got started? there should be a movie about that I would watch it on Netflix of course",Curious to dive deeper
770,Of course we would!  I hear that the company started because the founder was fed up with late fees of VHS rentals. Seems like ages ago....,Happy
770," Yeah a $40 late fee that broke Blockbuster, isn't that ironic",Curious to dive deeper
770," Blockbuster had more than one chance to buy Netflix, but they choked. And now Blockbuster, who could predict their own demise, will forever be known for their lack of foresight.",Happy
770," I know right, they owned the business but they didnt have the vision to keep on going, they had the chance to buy the company as low as $50 million, its a lot of money but now the company is worth $2 billion",Curious to dive deeper
770," Shame. I had a Blockbuster close to my home. Now it is an empty building. And today, Netflix and YouTube account for half of peak internet traffic in the US",Happy
770,And it also accounts for 33% of the bandwidth during the times of 9pm to 12 am in North America,Curious to dive deeper
770,Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph must be proud!,Happy
770," They must, they have built an empire I hope it doesnt go down, the streaming service Disney is launching will be a tough competition",Curious to dive deeper
770,Sure. There are lots of competition out there. I enjoy watching a lot of comedies they have on Netflix. I think there is a Demetri Martin comedy special available on Netflix now. He is awesome. He dropped out of law school out of boredom to start his career in comedy.,Happy
770," I might have to watch that one, Im going to search it in the IMDb data base",Curious to dive deeper
770," That's a good place to find out info!  The Shawshank Redemption is a highly rated movie on IMDB, which was not initially recognized in the theaters.",Happy
770," I really enjoyed that movie, so good, the plot, the actors, just wonderful, its actually my favorite all time movie",Curious to dive deeper
770," Well, it is the highest rated movie on IMDB, so there are a lot of folks that agree with you!",Happy
770,Have you watched the movie? if not you should really watch it,Curious to dive deeper
770,Many times and I will likely watch it again soon. It is always enjoyable to watch.  Nice chatting with you!,Happy
771,Hi there. Do you like romantic comedies?,Curious to dive deeper
771,I do!  I like all movies actually. lol,Happy
771,Netflix's series To All the Boys I've Loved Before is doing well.,Curious to dive deeper
771,Hmmm...I'm not familiar with that one.  I'm going to have to check it out on Netflix.,Happy
771,Have you watched The Kissing Booth? That was one of the most watched movies in the country.,Curious to dive deeper
771,Haha...I'm behind on my movies.  Is that one also on Netflix?  There may be some binge watching in my future.,Happy
771,Yes it is. Set it Up was also a favorite in June. To All the Boys I've Loved Before is one that has gained an intense fan base.,Surprised
771,From 9PM to 12AM Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in North America.  I'm going to have to catch up during those hours.  lol,Happy
771," Yeah, and there is rumor that there will be a Netflix sequel of To All the Boys I've loved. You have plenty to watch!",Surprised
771,Netflix and youtube make up half of the peak internet traffic in North America so I'll have some competition to catch up.  lol,Happy
771,You can escape to another world. Some Rom Coms can make viewers wish they were a teen again.,Curious to dive deeper
771," Yes!  I won't be watching on dvd because I don't subscribe to that.  However, people still must because Netflix spend 20 times more on postage than on bandwidth!",Happy
771,Crazy! Blockbuster must be regretting turning down the deal to buy Netflix!,Surprised
771," Yes seeing how Netflix is now worth $2 billion and Blockbuster is down to 1 store, which I saw that on the news this past week after a 2nd location announced they were closing.",Happy
771,Sad. I don't miss those late fees though. Reed Hastings was inspired to start Netflix because of a large late fee.,Surprised
771,Funny if the store was Blockbuster!  LOL,Surprised
771,Right! I used to check out DVDs of my favorite shows and movies there. I really liked the show Friends.,Happy
771," Me too!  I was surprised that 3rd Rcok from the Sun beat out Friends, Seinfeld, and Frasier for the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997.",Happy
771," Yeah, I never thought 3rd Rock was that funny. I'd watch it but it was never one of my favorites.",Surprised
771,It was that goofball corny comedy. lol  Ryan Stiles dropped out of high school to pursue a career in comedy.  Was he that skinny guy from the Drew Carey show?  I had fun chatting!,Happy
771," I'm not sure, glad it worked out for him though! Nice chatting with you!",Happy
772,Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;),Happy
772,Can you believe that some jellyfish are immortal?,Surprised
772," Ok, sorry. there is no way that is true... I mean... WHAT ? ",Curious to dive deeper
772," Yeah, I guess I figure that they must just keep living by replacing their own cells so fast that they never get old enough to die.",Neutral
772,Well why the hell can't we still that property from them ! ;),Curious to dive deeper
772," Hmm. Let's get research on that.  Sounds like gene splicing and all that.  Maybe in a few decades, it won't also cause cancer.",Curious to dive deeper
772," I would want that property... don't You ? I bet they are already using it, but they can't give it to the public because our planet is not ready for it ( overpopulation ) ",Curious to dive deeper
772," Immortality, maybe.  Maybe just for re-growing a liver or kidney ... or an eye?  I don't think I'd want to live forever.",Neutral
772," Oh come on, I'm not buying that... people say that, but nobody believes that ;) I think everybody want to live forever :)",Curious to dive deeper
772," I just don't think we're meant to go on and on here on Earth.  We'd get bored, for one.",Neutral
772," You know... one day You would be bored, the other You wouldn't... just like now ;) there will always be something exciting to wait for...",Curious to dive deeper
772,I think it would take a long long time to be bored ... yes.  What do you think it would be like to live to see your great-great-great-great-great- grandchildren and everyone in-between?,Curious to dive deeper
772,it would be fantastic ! I would assemble a soccer team just from my relatives ;) lol,Curious to dive deeper
772," You could probably start your own league.  And if the tech works to regenerate tendons, muscles, and such, you could infinitely recover from injuries.  Hmm.  Do you think at a certain point you would run out of the ability to remember so many years of life?",Curious to dive deeper
772,Well... do You forget how it was when You were like 8 ? I don't think You do... there are moments in Your life You'll remember forever and there are those less important that You don't...,Curious to dive deeper
772," Moments, yes.  But when I think back to a period like high school, it's four years, but a few dozen moments.  I think that over time, you'd remember just one thing from each decade.",Sad
772," Probably... but who cares, You would live to... I don't know - witness a first contact with alien civilization... :)",Curious to dive deeper
772,Perhaps.  But also nuclear war and diseases and such.  I'd rather die once than endure cancer 30 times.  Or warfare that weaponizes sound frequencies and light patterns.  Do you think such things will come too?,Fearful
772," Probably eventually ;) But I was only talking about being biologically ""always young"" - not indestructible ;) if a cancer would get you... that's it - lights out ;)",Curious to dive deeper
772," In that case, I think you'd have the obligation to work forever ... no retirements based on declining health and such.  That's not a good thing.",Fearful
772," Holy crap, I didn't think of that one :) lol",Curious to dive deeper
772," Also, then we'd run out of jobs ... yeah the math gets wonky there.",Sad
772,Hmmm... I would buy a farm and hire people to work for me for food :) endless circle ;) lol,Happy
772,And then stay in a bubble so you never get a disease?,Curious to dive deeper
772,I mean that would always stay as a #1 risk. So maybe we would focus on healthy food on that farm. For the sake of all of us :),Curious to dive deeper
772,Good plan.,Happy
773," Hello, do you like animals?",Surprised
773," Certain ones, mainly the cuter ones, lol!  :)  But yeah, I like animals, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
773,Hard to choose 20quintillion on earth!!!!,Curious to dive deeper
773," Speaking of liking animals... there's a zoo in Maryland that'll let you PET the African Penguins for a small fee.  That'd be an animal lovers dream, I bet!  ",Surprised
773,I saw that in the Washington post!,Curious to dive deeper
773," Yeah, apparently they like to be petted because it's similar to the way penguin groom (or preen) each others feathers.  I guess like other animals, it's a bonding experience. ",Happy
773,That is neat.  I wold like to meet Eddie the penguin!,Curious to dive deeper
773,any reason you like that particularly one?,Curious to dive deeper
773,He is 2 and already very interactive with people I hear.,Curious to dive deeper
773," He's probably a cutie.  Don't try to pick him up though, they say the penguin will peck at ya if you get too grabby! ",Surprised
773,The program is only 50 dollars too for 30 mins,Curious to dive deeper
773," Yeah, I'm told the money goes to help support breeding for endangered species, so it's a win-win for all involved!",Happy
773," Yes, 8 people can go in at a time",Curious to dive deeper
773," Neatly enough, you can't feed the penguins while you're there.  Apparently they'll only take food from the ""official"" feeders.  Found that interesting...",Surprised
773," Also interesting, they are African penguins!",Curious to dive deeper
773," Yeah, I guess they're picky about their food.  I tell ya something that's not.. a black swallower fish!  They can eat prey twice their length and TEN times their weight!",Surprised
773,Dang.  Did you know a seahorse is the only fish with a neck?,Curious to dive deeper
773," No, I didn't know that!  Aquatic life is rather fascinating.  They say, for example, there's a breed of jellyfish that is immortal!  Wonder if they call them ""Highlander Jellyfish"" lol!",Surprised
773," Yes, I actually researched them in school.  They can revert back to larvae when frightened.  They only die when eaten or external circumstances not due to age",Curious to dive deeper
773," Whoa, that is neat!  So you've actually studied about sea life in depth?  ",Curious to dive deeper
773," No not really.  Just interested in some things haha.  Take care, good chat!",Curious to dive deeper
773," Hey, you too!  Have a great evening!",Happy
774,Hey there do you like to dance? I like to dance I'm just horrible at it haha,Curious to dive deeper
774," Yes I love to dance.  did you know Bruce lee was a great dancer,  he won a cha cha championship",Curious to dive deeper
774," No I didn't know that. I think he was really talented personally, do you ever watch ballet by chance?",Curious to dive deeper
774," Ive seen some shows when I was younger,  nothing recently. ",Curious to dive deeper
774," Well I used to date a ballerina, and I know that her toes would get really beating up from all of the dancing, so it doesn't surprise me that professional ballet dancers can go through four pairs of shoes a week, even though that sounds crazy",Surprised
774,I know right.  Tupac danced ballet in high school,Curious to dive deeper
774,Yeah that's crazy. He was in The Nutcracker. You think anyone has a videotape of that? I bet they would make a lot of money haha. I also need to watch a baby dance. Apparently if you put on good music they will Bob to the beat,Surprised
774," I would like to see Tupac dance ballet as well.  As for the baby dancing,  I have seen that so many times,  its adorable. ",Curious to dive deeper
774," I need to see that! I also want to see the patent that Michael Jackson has, it's the patent for his extreme lean dance move that he would do onstage, I think he should be the only one to use it because he did it best",Curious to dive deeper
774," Its in his music video "" smooth criminal""",Curious to dive deeper
774," Yep you're right, that's a great music video by the way! Do you ever go golfing by the way? That's something I've tried but I'm just not good at it",Curious to dive deeper
774,nope.  I like minature golf though!,Neutral
774," Miniature golf is awesome! I need to go back I haven't done that in so long! What I don't like those how much water golf courses use, have you heard about this?",Curious to dive deeper
774,Yeah mini golf is awesome.  Yeah I wonder why they need so much water.,Curious to dive deeper
774," Yep I agree. I can't believe the average golf course uses 300,000 gallons of water, and then the one in Dubai AKA Saudi Arabia uses four million gallons a day, that's just insane and such a waste",Surprised
774,That is ridiculous!  And how many countries dont have clean water for people and golfers are just throwing it away to the grass or whatever.,Curious to dive deeper
774," Yep I agree. Just for a game instead of for people who actually need the clean water. I also didn't know that Babe Ruth was a golfer, I only heard about him being a good baseball player",Surprised
774,same here.  samuel l jackson get 2 days a week to play golf in his work clause.,Curious to dive deeper
774," That's pretty awesome! I bet he's really good. I didn't know too, in terms of wasting things, how much space golf courses use up. Apparently all the golf courses in the United States could take up the size of Rhode Island and Delaware combined",Surprised
774,To be fair those are small states lol,Curious to dive deeper
774," Haha that is true. It's still a lot of space though, it's two states! What do you think about literature by the way? Do you ever read a book",Curious to dive deeper
775," Hello there, are you a big fan of animals?",Curious to dive deeper
775,wow I never knew The black swallower fish can eat prey twice its own length and ten times its weigh.,Curious to dive deeper
775," I think I have heard about that one, so crazy!  Some of the creatures in the ocean really amaze me. ",Curious to dive deeper
775,yea and.A seahorse is the only fish to have a neck,Curious to dive deeper
775,That is crazy!  Those little things are really strange.  Do you know about the jellyfish that is immortal in a sense?,Curious to dive deeper
775,Did you know that There is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal,Curious to dive deeper
775," Yeah I have heard about those, I think they claim to put some of those in pills to help memory. ",Curious to dive deeper
775,Do you like animals ? here are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.,Happy
775,That is pretty crazy to think about.  I find it interesting as well thinking about how they even determine that number in the first place.,Curious to dive deeper
775,lol me too. Animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated.,Curious to dive deeper
775,Do you know if that is why dogs and cats have those patches as well?,Curious to dive deeper
775," good question. In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights.",Happy
775,I wonder who represents them in court or fights for their rights when they are threatened?,Curious to dive deeper
775," lmao the lawyer could be a dog lol.  the 1912 scottish protection of animals act, the loch ness monster is a protected species.",Surprised
775," That is nuts to me, I think the loch ness monster was really some greenland sharks that swam upstream and were spotted. ",Curious to dive deeper
775,I think its a human in custom. did you know that humans will regrow a rib equally as strong as the original,Surprised
775,Yeah the way that we grow back bones in an incredible feat if you ask me.,Curious to dive deeper
775,yhere is a sound frequency that causes fear in us,Surprised
775," I never knew that, I wonder if they use that in horror movies all the time and we just don't notice it. ",Curious to dive deeper
775,and we are adapted for persistence hunting making them among the best distance runners among all running animals.,Surprised
775," Not the fastest, but the longest lol.  Well it's been good talking with you, I hope you have a good night!",Happy
776,Hey! How are you? Do you like animals?,Neutral
776," Yes, The study of non-humans is called zoology. Animals are multicellular.",Happy
776," True. By the way, do you have any pets home?",Curious to dive deeper
776," Yes, I have some fishes and dogs. what about you ?",Happy
776," No, I don't. Fish is cool. I'd love to have fish. Is it difficult to take care of?",Neutral
776," Yes, The animal plays a important role in food web. They categories into three group according to the way of consume foods. They are carnivores, omnivores, herbivores.",Curious to dive deeper
776,Can you believe there 20 quintillion individual animals on our planet? It's huge number!!!!,Neutral
776," Due to deforestation, we lost so many features. It is very difficult to preserve the forest and save the animals from hunter. Elephant is mainly hunted for its ivory.",Happy
776,Anyway people make effort to protect animals. Germany is the first country to give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights. It's so cool.,Surprised
776,It is very interesting. We must save and protect them. We expanding you area and occupy their living space.,Happy
776,True. Did you know that in Scotland there is protection act and loch ness monster is a protected species.,Surprised
776," Fishes living in fresh water drink only fresh water through their skin via osmosis, while the saltwater fish drink water through mouth.",Happy
776," Yes, and a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck. I completely didn't know it. What else do you know? Share with me, please.",Neutral
776,I see in the fish exhibition in my childhood. Its very nice time.,Happy
776," Really? I'm sure it is beautiful. There is something interesting about humans. For example, there is sound frequency that causes fear in humans. ",Surprised
776,All animals and plants synthesize their own vitamin C but human cannot do it due to defect of gene.,Happy
776,True. It's part of us. Actually humans are among best running animals and this is because of hunting. I'm not surprised. In order to have good result in hunting you have to run very well.,Neutral
776," In the early stage, human want to hunt for their food, so only he domesticated dog for hunting.",Happy
776,True. Human always try to adopt all animals for their need.,Neutral
776,Humans use tools to a much higher degrees than any other animals,Happy
776,True. It was nice chat. Thanks and have a good day!,Neutral
777,Hello! Did you hear about the cougar attack that killed the mountain biker?,Curious to dive deeper
777,I heard it was all the way in Washington State!,Surprised
777," Yes! How scary, I read that they found the cougar and killed it. Sad how animals think they have to attack for their safety.",Sad
777,I cannot imagine mountain biking and then being attacked like that.,Neutral
777,Right! I guess they drug the dead victim to their Den....that's where police found him. What a horrific death.,Fearful
777," Yes, sad that they had to kill the animal but best for the safety of others.",Sad
777," Exactly, they did a necropsy on the dead cougar and find out if it had a disease because cougars usually run away not attack. ",Neutral
777,Do you know the results?,Surprised
777,They didn't mention results. But there have only been 120 cougar attacks in 100 years so this is pretty rare.,Neutral
777,25 have been fatal!,Curious to dive deeper
777,That is horrible! I guess with more and more people building and doing more and more into the woods these animals feel like they are in danger.,Surprised
777,Did you know there is a lawyer in switzerland who represents animals.,Curious to dive deeper
777," Really! That is interesting! Animals are only protecting their only home, it's all so sad!",Neutral
777," I wonder how you even testify with an animal. Also, what happens if the animal wins?",Curious to dive deeper
777,I wouldn't even know lol....maybe it's about if the animal gets put down after an attack or not.,Curious to dive deeper
777,I think you are right. I wonder how he is paid if the animal loses?,Neutral
777,Must be free...or paid out by who hired them....good question! I was astounded to read that we have 20 quintillion individual animals on earth....wow.,Surprised
777,That is crazy. I cannot even imagine what the number would be if some animals havent gone extinct.,Surprised
777," Exactly....we will be taken over by animals if they keep reproducing quickly. I guess animals and fish are like humans, you threaten their young and they fight back....",Curious to dive deeper
777,I guess so. Can you imagine having a goldfish for 43 years?,Neutral
777," Wow, can't imagine! Fish can be pretty interesting, and strange looking.",Happy
777,Agreed! Have a nice day.,Happy
778,Did you know you can pet penguins at the Maryland Zoo?,Neutral
778," No I had no clue, I'd love to pet penguins at the Maryland  zoo",Surprised
778,Me too! There are a bunch of African Penguins there. It costs $50 and you get a 30 minute encounter.,Neutral
778,$50 to pet a penguin for a half hour doesn't sound too bad I definitely pay for it,Neutral
778,Me too.  Plus it supports penguin breeding,Neutral
778," Thats awesome. Apparently penguins act like overstimulated toddlers, sounds like so much fun",Happy
778," See, if you asked me to be in a room full of toddlers, Id decline, but little penguins, count me in. ",Neutral
778,Yea you can't really take a toddler to a small yard with a pool like you can with penguins,Neutral
778,Did you know that when animals get a white patch on their forehead it means they have been domesticated,Neutral
778," No, that's pretty crazy. I wonder if humans can ever domesticate a jellyfish that is biologically immortal",Curious to dive deeper
778,It is kind of crazy to think that they can live like that.  They are going to take over the world.  lol,Neutral
778,Lol well in Switzerland they already have a lawyer who represents animals,Surprised
778," Thats really cool, some places there are actually rights for animals like Germany.",Neutral
778,That's pretty crazy but animals do share similarities with humans like animals from the same species speaking different dialects,Neutral
778,Even the Loch Ness Monster is a protected species.,Neutral
778,That's interesting. Did you know there is a 226 year old koi fish named Hanako?,Curious to dive deeper
778,Really?  Where does it live?,Neutral
778," I have no clue, I'd imagine in China or Japan since its name is Hanako",Neutral
778," True, I would assume it is a aquarium or zoo or something.",Neutral
778," Yea, I guess fish can live very long, the oldest goldfish lived to 43 years old",Surprised
778,Wow that is a long time.  I had one for 3 years and I thought he lived a long time.,Neutral
778," well i got to go, nice talking with you",Neutral
779,Hi! Do you visit the library these days/,Curious to dive deeper
779," hi, I go sometimes, I like their collection of books dvds and audiobooks, you?",Curious to dive deeper
779," Yeah, once upon a time, I went to the library for DVDs and CDs as well before streaming was popular, but these days I go mainly for the books since I prefer traditional books over ebooks.",Happy
779," ya I agree with that, good to know there are more libraries than mcdonalds in the usa",Surprised
779," Wow, how is that possible? But considering the vast amount of resources library provides, I suppose it's true. Like when a man was mistakenly imprisoned, he spend most of his time in the library to study law and prove his innocence! ",Surprised
779,that is impressive! I want to come out with a book in norway! the government will buy 1000 copies of any book that is published,Curious to dive deeper
779," That's really supportive! I wonder if it's enough to put into the number of libraries in Norway, if not you can convince them to support more!",Surprised
779,haha good plan! and if you make a kids book they buy 1500 copies! instant guaranteed sales!,Surprised
779," That's not bad at all, does the same hold true for shoes since professional ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week, imagine the pain their toes are in!",Curious to dive deeper
779,yup! I dated a ballet dancer and her toes were always jacked! I don't recommend it for kids,Neutral
779," Oh my goodness, did you give her pointe shoes as gifts? I imagine it's a big expense if they go through that many pairs per week",Surprised
779," haha she didn't go through 4 but ya always had feet problems and her shoes were always dinged up, very weird!",Neutral
779," Ouch! It sounds quite painful, if she had stinky feet, you could put dry tea bags in the shoes to absorb the unpleasant odors. Natural and cost friendly, no of any other remedies like that?",Curious to dive deeper
779," lol I'll keep that in mind, did you know some shoes are designed specifically for things like skiing or hiking?",Surprised
779," Yeah, I've seen those at outdoor shops like REI and Dick's Sporting Goods, any brand you recommend?",Curious to dive deeper
779," I like north face myself, but I haven't been hiking in a while, I hurt my ankle last time, do you ever wear hiking shoes?",Curious to dive deeper
779," Oh yeah, I like North Face as well they have kept me very warm in this cold weather recently. Yes, I wear hiking shoes ever since I've noticed how slippery some paths can be but they are quite expensive, more expensive than the line of shoes that Stephon Marbury promoted which only retailed for $15.",Surprised
779," haha oh wow thats funny, did you know that 5000 year old shoes can perform better than some modern ones? I want to try those",Surprised
779,Thats crazy! How does one still have access to 5000 year old shoes?,Curious to dive deeper
779,yes indeed! Did you hear what steve smith does after every nfl game he plays?,Surprised
779,What does he do? I imagine he celebrates with one of those victory dances?,Curious to dive deeper
780," Hello,  do you play any fantasy games?  It looks like people even draft fantasy spelling bees lol ",Happy
780," I saw that! I play both fantasy football and basketball, so I found that pretty interesting. Did you know there is also fantasy congress? ",Curious to dive deeper
780,Fantasy congress seems like a headache lol Do you try and vet them too?  like get a background check find all their dirty secrets?  haha,Surprised
780," Ha! Yeah I'm fed up with real politics, I don't need more in my life lol That would make it more fun to get background checks though haha do you play fantasy sports? ",Curious to dive deeper
780,No I do not play any fantasy.  I have watched that show The League!  That is hilarious!,Happy
780," I love that show! Do you play or watch any sports? I just read about cricket- nothing I'm familiar with, but I did see that the longest match in history took 14 days. I wonder how long a normal match takes...",Curious to dive deeper
780," I dont play any sports,  I work out,  go to the gym,  snowboard and swim.  I have never played cricket,  but that is insane!  I have heard of tennis matches going for like 3 days though lol ",Surprised
780," I don't play any either, but I do a lot of the same things you mentioned! Except swimming. I'm a horrible swimmer. I don't know much about tennis, but that sounds really long lol Apparently the US has a cricket team from Compton that won the British cup two times",Neutral
780," Wow I didnt realize people in Compton play cricket,  that is impressive though! ",Surprised
780,Right? Kind of surprising. Are you interested in travel?,Neutral
780," Absolutely!  I hear the dutch are creating this crazy fast bus, supposably it travels 160mph!  We need that in California!",Surprised
780,Thats amazing! I can't imagine how much faster my work commute would be. Did you know iceland has no public rail service at all? Apparently people either drive or use domestic flights. Sounds expensive!,Happy
780," Ugh,  that sounds horrible.  I wonder why that is.  maybe its cheaper if more people use it a lot.  I read that Mackinac Island has no motorized vehicles.  They travel by horse or bike,  how about that commute??  lol",Surprised
780,Yeah I was wondering the same- maybe people just don't travel much there. I can't even imagine commuting by horse lol I guess this is making me grateful that I at least don't have to fly or ride in a carriage!,Happy
780," traveling by horse sounds tiring!  I took a few horse back riding lessons and after a few hours your thighs really hurt,  just from the position you are in.  And is there free horse parking?  Do you have to pick up your horses poops like you do with dogs?  Thats crazy lol ",Surprised
780,I used to ride competitively when I was younger and yeah its definitely a work out! And i'm not sure what you would do if you had to ride your horse to work...and maybe the city takes care of the poop? This town sounds super weird lol Did you know all the highways in Japan are toll roads? Apparently it costs around $300 to travel across the country,Happy
780," I did know that,  that country wants to charge you for everything!  it is so expensive there from what ive heard.  I am visiting next year in Feb.  mostly to go snowboarding lol everyone talks about the JaPow! ",Surprised
780,It sounds super expensive! I'm super jealous you get to visit to snowboard- I've heard their snow is insane!,Happy
780,I know right!  Cant freaking wait!  My friends are going up next month Im super jealous of them!,Curious to dive deeper
780,Well hopefully they come back with good experiences and advice to share! That way you can avoid spending that $300 driving around lol,Happy
780,lol right!  Have you traveled to go snowboarding?,Happy
780," Not outside of the US, but Ive gone to Park City a few times. Nice talking with you! Enjoy your travel to Japan!",Happy
781," Hi, how are you?",Happy
781,Good. And you? Do you like to travel? Ever been to Japan?,Curious to dive deeper
781,I do like to travel but I have not been to Japan. What about you? Do you like to travel and have you everbeen to japan?,Happy
781,I have not but it's on my bucket list. I'd think twice about driving while I was there though. EVERY highway is a toll road.,Surprised
781,Really! That's strange. Why do you think that is?,Curious to dive deeper
781,Probably to keep traffic down. That's my guess anyway. At least they're not like Makinac Island where they don't allow any cars at all. That's some serious traffic control.,Surprised
781," I think it would be good, if the island was small enough and nice enough. If it were in a nice area, where you could ride bikes year round, I would love it.",Happy
781," Yeah, that would be very leisurly. They use bikes or horse drawn carriages I think.",Neutral
781," I couldn't do the horse drawn carriage thing. It would take too long... ""I have to go to town, get the horse and buggie ready!""",Happy
781,Would be a little smelly too. In Iceland they have to fly everywhere if they don't have a car. There's no public rail service.,Happy
781," That could get really expensive quick! Have you heard about a start up and Uber partnering for flying cars, more like drones, that would take a trip around chicago from 1.5 hours to 8 minutes...",Surprised
781,I did not. That would be a better wat to get around Iceland also. When do they plan on testing it I wonder?,Curious to dive deeper
781,2025 is what I heard. I think it was a segment on a podcast I was listening to. It wuld be nice to have it but I wouldn't trust it yet.,Happy
781," Yeah, there's no failsafe if your flying car breaks down and you plummet to your death. It would be cool to fly an Uber to my Cricket game. I think I'd look cool landing on the pitch.",Neutral
781," Yeah, that'd be baller! The worst would be the poor peole on the ground that get killed by a falling drone like machine.",Happy
781," Yeah, not a great solution. Sorry Jetsons! But seriously do you play Cricket?",Neutral
781,I do not. I cannot understand it for the life of me. I do love sport though.,Happy
781,It's kind of like baseball but with only two bases or bowling with only one pin to try to hit.,Neutral
781,Do you play a lot? Are you any good?,Curious to dive deeper
781,I was on a US born team from COmpton. We won the British Cup twice.,Happy
781,There's so much to unpack there. Maybe next time. Take care.,Happy
782," Hello, are you a fan of cricket?",Curious to dive deeper
782," Hi, I would like to learn more!",Happy
782," Well the game is very similar to baseball! You score runs by hitting the ball bowled towards you, and the other team tries to catch the ball to get you out!",Neutral
782," I know a little bit, like the fact that the game is played by two teams and each one has 11 players",Curious to dive deeper
782," Yeah there's definitely some differences, also to my knowledge there isn't a wicket in baseball, and a lot more field to cover than 22 yards.",Neutral
782," Yes, cricket has a small field. I found there is an indian player whose name is Napoleon einstein",Surprised
782," That's a strange name for sure haha, I wonder if he ever got bullied for it in the sport. I know the best player in cricket's history had nasty tactics against him, leading to the other teams facing consequences",Curious to dive deeper
782," And the consequences went far beyond, there were even diplomatic consequences!! for England and Australia",Happy
782," At least karma wins out in the end, the best teams aren't always the ones that play it most. There was an all US team from Compton that won the British Cup twice.",Surprised
782," Australia has been so important in cricket, I learned they had won 45% of all cricket cups",Surprised
782," That's crazy! Although it makes sense considering their overall dominance, I think they've been in more than 60% of all finals right?",Neutral
782," That is right and there is a very interesting match that occurred in 1939, do you know why it is so interesting?",Happy
782," No I haven't heard of it! I don't follow cricket a whole lot, but what happened?",Curious to dive deeper
782," Well, this was a match between England and S. africa and lasted fourteen days, i can not imagine how it was!",Happy
782," Oh my goodness, I would've dropped from exhaustion long before that, I wonder how many people had been dismissed from the game by the end of it! That has to have been the longest game ever.",Surprised
782," Well, talking about records, there is one that I would like to copy. It is a travel record by the king Kalakaua, who was the first king to travel around the world",Happy
782," Ahah that's certainly some ambition you have, I want to travel a lot but I found out Japan may not be the best place for me, to go across the country it costs over $300 just in tolls!",Surprised
782," That is a lot! I would do it just once because i agree, it is a lot of money. I would be a different story in Mackinac island, where there are only horse drawn carriages",Surprised
782," Wow that would certainly take a long time. I can't imagine what would take longer, that or traveling in Iceland, where most people without cars have to use domestic flights to travel between towns.",Curious to dive deeper
782," That is the beauty of it, each place is completely different! Even there is  a commuter bus in the making that would travel at 160 mph!",Surprised
782,I bet that's useful especially when you don't have enough room for horse carriages everywhere! Feels like Mackinac Island should definitely withdraw their ban on motorized vehicles and modernize.,Curious to dive deeper
782,Well It was nice talking to you! have a good one!,Happy
783,Do you use the library?,Neutral
783," Hi, how are you? I used to use the library a lot. Now I use the Internet. It's more convenient. How about you?",Neutral
783,I kind of wish we could digitalize all the information in all libraries into one comprehensive database. it seems a shame that all the resources and information in libraries are nowdays often ignored,Neutral
783," Libraries have been crucial to preserving and disseminating knowledge. Now their role is a different, but they are still important.",Neutral
783,What do you think their role is today?,Neutral
783,Many people go there to use computers because they can't afford one. I think that the librarians help people find information. Very little need to reshelf books.,Neutral
783," I mean it is still a great resource. A falsely imprisoned man spent 10 years in the library to study law, prove his innocence, and became a lawyer to help others with similar plights",Neutral
783,That's great! Prison libraries are a great resource for motivated inmates. I have trouble believing that there are more libraries than mcdonald's in the US,Neutral
783," Speaking of the role of libraries changing, sacramento recently released a public library of things for patrons to check out things from sewing machines to other items people would need in the short term",Neutral
783," A tool library! That's a great idea. I figure it's a good public service. Some people don't have space or money for such things. Borrow it, return it. Save on resources, too.",Neutral
783," Indeed. I also like how norway is encouraging literacy. If you publish a book, the government will buy 1000 copies and distribute them throughout the country",Neutral
783," You could write a book, get published, and then go to McDonald's. I guess Norway has the money to buy books. ",Neutral
783," True. I also respect how in his old age, the uk prime minister founded a library and donated his personal collection of 32K books",Neutral
783,He took the collection to the library himself. At age 85. He couldn't hire someone? Seems like a lot of work. Maybe he wanted the exercise.,Neutral
783,Maybe he simply wanted to personally bring books with not reader to readers with no books,Neutral
783,That's true. I thought he would hire a company to move the books to the library.,Neutral
783,I wonder what kind of shoes he was wearing when he walked 3/4 mile back and forth for 32K books. I hope it wasn't a basic sandal,Neutral
783," The man probably could afford tremendous shoes, on par with the best shoes every created.",Neutral
783,Ironically did you know 5000 year old shoes performed better than modern shoes?,Neutral
783,I bet those shoes were made to last. Couldn't just go to the store or the cobbler.,Neutral
783," True indeed. In any case, thanks for chatting.",Neutral
784," Hi, do you have a dog? Either as a pet or in another role?",Curious to dive deeper
784,I don't but I used to . We have two cats now. Did you know that dog and elephants are the only animals that understand pointing.,Surprised
784," I did not. Sometimes I think my cats do, but they probably don't. I always thought dogs and wolves were closely related until I saw a wolf last week and looked it up. Turns out the wolves that domesticated dogs decent from are a lot different then todays wolves.",Curious to dive deeper
784,I find dogs interesting. I did not know that there are 12 different blood types that dogs could have. And I did not know dogs could donate blood at dog drives.,Curious to dive deeper
784,Yes! I see them advertise them at the local pet store. I had no idea either. I guess there are benefits to being the first domesticated species.,Surprised
784,And what I think is kind of interesting is that Google prefers dogs to cats and it is stated they are a dog company,Curious to dive deeper
784," It's weird when people bring their pets to work. Dogs are more workers, they have so many uses like herding or helping you hunt, where as cats are just like roommates.",Curious to dive deeper
784,That is true. I think we should do what they do in Istanbul. If they recycle plastic bottles they have a vending machine to feed the citys stray dogs.,Surprised
784,That is a great idea. It's sad to see any abandoned pet outside dog or cat.,Surprised
784,I agree it is really nice to do,Curious to dive deeper
784,Do you have any other pets? I also have a couple of snakes and a legless lizard which although it looks like a snake is not a snake.,Curious to dive deeper
784,I used to have snakes. I had a mouse that ate my snake once. I should move to New Zealand there are no snakes there.,Surprised
784,I almost don't want to know what they did to get rid of them. It's funny how some people like us are not afraid of snakes. The fear of snakes is hard wired into the human brain.,Curious to dive deeper
784,Did you know there are some flying snakes that launch themselves at prey. I would love to see that,Surprised
784,Crazy. I have not seen them. A lot of people who come over mistake my legless lizard for a snake but once you know how to tell them apart it's so obvious. The ears especially give him away.,Curious to dive deeper
784,That is true. Do you like Jazz music.,Surprised
784," I do. You might know this or you might laugh but I love Clint Eastwood's jazz music, but not so much his movies.",Happy
784,I like that there is a woman in harlem who has had free jazz concerts for 20 years and some jazz artists actually stop by. That's pretty cool.,Surprised
784,Neat. I'll have to check that out next time I'm in NYC. Free too!,Surprised
784,It is awesome that Jazz is played all over. In Pakistan they have a jazz artist who's on the charts.,Surprised
784," Cool! I think I'm going to go listen to some jazz now, I have some really old lps. Anyway have a great night.",Happy
784,You too.,Curious to dive deeper
784,bye,Neutral
785,Do you enjoy going to the library?,Neutral
785," Hello - I used to go to the library all the time when I was little, but I haven't been to one in a very long time. What about you? \",Curious to dive deeper
785," I agree. I used to go, but no longer. I feel it is a shame since a library is an invaluable resource for the community, offering vast amounts of resources",Neutral
785,Yep. Did you know Jupiter saves Earth from many asteroids?,Surprised
785,I did. It is among the many facts you can find in the library. Did you know a falsely imprisoned man spent 10 studying law and became a lawyer after proving his innocence?,Neutral
785," Oh wow that's pretty amazing. I saw that the direction of Earth's magnetic field reverses every 200,000-300,000 years.",Surprised
785,What kind of affect does the reversal of magnetic field have on life on earth?,Neutral
785,I have no idea on that. I'm thinking maybe natural disasters and things of that nature.,Curious to dive deeper
785," Did you know that if earth's history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans only make up for 1 min and 17 sec?",Neutral
785,That's pretty eye opening of how short humans have lived on the Earth.,Surprised
785,It is a shame though that in such a short time we have destroyed 80% of earth's nature forests. I hope we can change that for the better going forward the next few minutes,Neutral
785,The Earth is almost 4 times as dense as the sun.,Surprised
785,That is pretty cool. Do you think earth will continue to be the only life inhabited planet?,Neutral
785,I'm not sure on that. I'm a religious person and think God only put people on this planet. I have no idea if there is other life out there.,Happy
785,The UN even appointed official ambassadors for extraterrestrials just in case,Neutral
785,That's crazy. Do you think there is other life out there/,Surprised
785," Considering the vastness of space, it seems more likely for more life to exist than not",Neutral
785," Yea that's a good point. It's hard to say if there is other lifeforms out there. Switching gears a bit, did you know there are at least 17 ways to tie your shoes?",Surprised
785,I did not. I only use like 2?,Neutral
785,Haha yea same here. I really only use 1 way.,Curious to dive deeper
785," I wonder if shoes will evolve to be lace less? In any case, thank you for the enjoyable chat.",Neutral
786," Hello, do you know much about the earth?",Curious to dive deeper
786," Not much, except that i live there...",Happy
786,Good enough. When earth was created apparently the day was only 5.5 hours,Curious to dive deeper
786,That would be crazy! How would one nap?,Curious to dive deeper
786,I know no time for nap. And 71% of the earth is covered in water,Curious to dive deeper
786,Wow! That seems like a lot. I wonder how much is salt water like in water world.,Happy
786," The majority of it. Sadly, 80% of the forests have been destroyed",Curious to dive deeper
786,That does make me sad. Teddy Roosevelt was a known conservationist. He made the National park and forest service.,Happy
786," Wow, goof for him.  Did you know earth will be helium free by the end of the century?",Curious to dive deeper
786,Is that a bad thing? Can we make it in a lab?  Can old shoes perform better than new shoes?,Curious to dive deeper
786,Yeah apparently shoes that date back to 5000 years ago are much stronger,Curious to dive deeper
786,Maybe those cobblers can make ballet shoes. They go through 4 pairs a week!,Surprised
786,Yeah that is a lot of shoes. Do you know how the keep them smelling fresh?,Curious to dive deeper
786,Febreeze?,Curious to dive deeper
786,Hahaha yes great option. But also tea bags,Curious to dive deeper
786,can you imagine wheelbarrowing 32000 books at 85 years old?,Surprised
786,No but I heard Gladstone did that. What an amazing man,Curious to dive deeper
786,I would just give up... There are more libraries than mcdonalds so that is a good start.,Surprised
786,I like that fact a lot. Have you heard of the Library of Things?,Curious to dive deeper
786," No, I have not. What is it?",Curious to dive deeper
786,A library in Sacramento where you can borrow other stuff besides books. Nice chat :),Happy
787,Are you a dog fan like Google?,Surprised
787," Personally, I like most animals, regardless of whether they are cats or dogs. I admit however that the history of man and dogs are a long and interesting one.",Happy
787,Who would've thought that man's best friend would truly be man's best friend and be able to get blood transfusions?,Surprised
787," Honestly, I don't know why the concept that animals can give eachother blood transfusions never occured to me. However, dogs have adapted very well to living with humans.",Curious to dive deeper
787,The stray dogs are spared in Istanbul due to generous recyclers who put0 their recyclables in a machine that dispenses food and water to them.,Surprised
787," That is very fascinating. Considering how many people love their pets, I think that would definitely motivate some people to recylce more. I didn't get to ask, do you like most animals like dogs or snakes?",Curious to dive deeper
787," I sort of like dogs, but snakes no way!  I respect that they are such stealthy animals that can swallow prey bigger than their heads though!",Surprised
787," Personally, I am okay with reptiles like snakes, but I do feel that you can't get as close a bond with them than other mammals. This may be due to the inherent fear of snakes wired into the brains of mammals. For instance, you have seen those videos of cats being scared of cucumbers?",Curious to dive deeper
787,My dog is afraid of vacuums.  So maybe they look like snakes with all those hoses.,Curious to dive deeper
787," They probably don't understand what vaccums are. If I didn't know what vaccums were and this weird thing made weird noises and sucked air, I would be scared of it too.",Curious to dive deeper
787,I wonder if animals in New Zealand fear snakes because they have none there.,Surprised
787,It must be a paradise for people who hate snakes. I mean in some places there are flying snakes.,Surprised
787,I guess that makes legless lizards not seem so scary.,Curious to dive deeper
787," I mean I'm fine with reptiles if they can't bite my arm off or they don't have poison. Although I fear crocodiles like poisonous snakes, I never knew crocodiles are more closely related to birds than snakes.",Surprised
787," I like observing animals and all the neat things about them, but there's nothing like relaxing to some smooth jazz!  I would have loved to see the free jazz concerts in Harlem hosted by a woman at her apartment the past 20 years.  Some famous people even have been there.",Curious to dive deeper
787," Jazz is very intriquing as it maintained its core essence all the while abosorbing and drawing from different national, regional, and local cultures to adapt unique styles. Even in Korea, jazz bars are quite popular.",Curious to dive deeper
787," I wonder why growing goatees adds comfort to jazz trumpeters.  I played the trumpet, but I don't see the connection.",Curious to dive deeper
787," Perhaps it is a cultural phenomenon, a symbol of their art?",Curious to dive deeper
787,Maybe Clint Eastwood understands as he has enjoyed jazz all his life.  I didn't know he played the piano,Curious to dive deeper
787," Jazz is now a major form of musical expression with many famous players such as Clint Eastwood. As you said, perhaps he would understand. After all, it seems like he is a man of many talents and understanding.",Neutral
787,I wonder what a jazz orchestra sounds like?  They have one in Pakistan.  Would they have violins in jazz?  Nice talking to you!,Curious to dive deeper
788,I love animals. I especially love dogs. How do you feel about dogs?,Curious to dive deeper
788," I'm a huge dog lover. I grew with them all my life. Funny though, since I've been on my own I've had a cat. I really want a dog too though.",Happy
788,I currently also have cats. Did you know that there are 12 different blood types for dogs?,Curious to dive deeper
788,Nope! Interesting though. Us humans only four. Do you have a favorite type of dog?,Curious to dive deeper
788,I tend to the like the smaller ones but not too small. French Bulldog sized dogs. They also have blood drives for dogs which is very nice.,Neutral
788,I love Golden Retrievers. Always had once growing up. So smart. My parents recently had a Novia Scotia Duck Trolling Retriever. Smartest dog I've ever known. He had a huge vocabulary.,Happy
788,They are both very smart dogs. Did you also know that dogs and elephants are the only animals that have the instinct to understand pointing?,Curious to dive deeper
788," Yeah, they can learn over a thousand words and reason better than chimps too!",Happy
788,Oh wow! Very impressive. Have you heard about the dog vending machines in Instanbul?,Curious to dive deeper
788,No I did not. Is it for dog treats for the human owners or can the dogs actually use them?,Curious to dive deeper
788,I'm not sure who does the deposit but it will release food and water for stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles. That's such a good idea.,Happy
788,I bet the dogs are smart enough to figure out that if they bring plastic back they get food. That's awesome! In Moscow some dogs have actually figured out how to use the subway.,Happy
788,I'm sure they are. Wow! I did not know about the subway in Moscow. We should give animals a lot more credit.,Surprised
788,Yeah I mean we haven't even really mentioned all the dogs that have actual jobs lol. It's incredible.,Neutral
788,It definitely is. Did you know that dogs being color blind is a myth?,Curious to dive deeper
788,I think I've heard that before. They just see color in lower definition or something right?,Curious to dive deeper
788,They just don't see as many colors as we do.,Neutral
788,Did you know that dogs attached themselves to earlier humans by hanging around and getting rewarded with food?,Curious to dive deeper
788,I did not but that makes complete sense. I know that they say that the direct ancestor of current domesticated dogs is likely extinct.,Neutral
788,Right it was a different kind of wolf that dogs evolved from them. I think smaller and probably less aggressive towards humans.,Neutral
788,Yes the modern wolves are not closely related to that wolf. Nice chatting with you.,Neutral
789,Hello!  Do you like dogs?,Happy
789,I love dogs.  They are the easiest way to clean the floor. Truly a messy eaters best friend.,Happy
789," lol  That's funny!  Dogs are not colour blind, but can't see as many different colors as human.",Happy
789,I think Canis lups familiaris is better than canis familiaris.  Cause some dogs are a little loopy.,Happy
789," lol  Due to them being so smart their influence on humans is what gave them the nickname ""man's best friend"".",Happy
789,Mans biggest moocher as well.  I know that if I point at something the dog will go look at it.  Do you have an elephant?  Can you point at things for it to look at?,Happy
789," LOL Funny!  But, true!  There are 12 different blood types of dogs.  I never knew that.",Surprised
789," No, I had no idea.  I have also never heard of a dog blood drive.  My dog can  not drive.  Too many squirrels..",Happy
789,hahaha My dog doesn't like snakes.  He should be a New Zealand dog since there are no snakes there!,Happy
789,The fear of snakes must be hard wired into it's brain as well as humans and monkey brains.  Interesting how some things you just know and some you learn  on the job.,Neutral
789,Yes!  lol  There is a genus of flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey.  Sure wouldn't want to cross on of those!,Happy
789," It would be easy to be afraid of them.  I happen to know that snakes paired organs occur one after the other, not side by side.  Got to be thin, join weight watchers.",Happy
789,haha  There are legless lizards that resemble snakes.  I wonder what they look like?  That would be odd to see a snake like body with a lizard head.,Curious to dive deeper
789," It seems that lizards have evolved from having legs to not about 25 times.  So, there must be an advantage to it.",Neutral
789,yes! lol  Do you like jazz music by any chance?,Curious to dive deeper
789," Like a snake, I have no ears for music.",Neutral
789,lololol,Surprised
789," Jazz is easy to like, for it is free verse in a way.  All about expression. ",Surprised
789," Yes!  Clint Eastwood is a lifetime jazz fan, plays piano, and scored several films with the music!",Happy
789,It would be pretty wild to go to someones house in Harlem and listen to a free jazz concert.  With Dirty Harry working the door.,Happy
789,LOL yes!  It was a pleasure chatting with you!  Have a good evening!,Happy
790,Are you an avid reader of comic books?,Curious to dive deeper
790,A little. I have read a few of the Marvel comics.,Neutral
790," I know that people call them ""graphic novels"" now. The story lines have become more serious. I don't know how I would go about picking the best books of the year.",Curious to dive deeper
790,Comics go back as far as the 1830s and started in Japan,Neutral
790,Really? I didn't know that. I imagine that pictorial story telling went back to the Egyptians.,Curious to dive deeper
790,Comics actually started  out as strips in newspapers in this country,Neutral
790," The name is a bit misleading because many of the stories are quite serious. I heard that Stan Lee ends his converstaions with the word ""Excelsior!"" I wonder what that's about.",Curious to dive deeper
790,Stan Lee will forever be remembered. His passing was a great loss to the comic world,Neutral
790,I heard that he got $1 million per year just to stay alive! That's a great incentive. I heard that Marvel trademarked the names super-hero and super villain.,Surprised
790," I am just glad that Michael Jackson didn't get his hands on Marvel, he would have likely ruined it",Neutral
790," Disney has made a lot of movies, which is good, but I wonder how the fans feel about Marvel now. Do you read DC comics ever?",Curious to dive deeper
790,Only for the Superman comic,Neutral
790," DC stands for detective comics, so DC Comics stands for detective comics comics. I think Marvel is more popular in general.",Neutral
790,I always found it interesting that Google got its domain from Garfield,Neutral
790,I didn't know that! Garfield?! I think it is one of the boring-est comics out there. Lasagna + Mondays = humor? Not to me!,Surprised
790,I was a huge Garfield fan when I was a kid,Happy
790,Comics are a good way for kids to learn to read. I liked reading Peanuts.,Neutral
790," I wish I had a copy of the first comic, Famous Funnies. That is worth a lot of money I bet",Neutral
790," I bet! I wonder what was in it. Famous Funnies, but I have no idea what characters where in there. No so famous now, I guess.",Curious to dive deeper
790,I wonder what the early Japanese comics were like?,Curious to dive deeper
790," Probably different from today's. Maybe based on samurai and ninja, not cutesy characters.",Curious to dive deeper
790,I don't think I would find them too funny either,Neutral
790,LOL! I agree. Maybe people didn't see the medium as inherently funny. Might have watched live entertainment for laughs.,Curious to dive deeper
790,I enjoyed our conversation about comics. Thanks,Neutral
791," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
791," Hey, I'm doing pretty well. How are you?",Curious to dive deeper
791," I am doing well! Are you a fan of hip hop? I am a pretty big fan myself, its been around since the 70s",Curious to dive deeper
791," I do. I'll add a caveat that I'm a white guy and 90's grunge is my favorite type of music, but I'm into everything. I don't know much about the history though, especially the stuff in the 70's but I loved rap from the 90's and early 2000's.",Neutral
791,I have heard that Mcdonalds used to pay artists for referencing the big mac in their music!,Curious to dive deeper
791," Doesn't surprise. You still artists doing stuff like that today. I wonder who referenced McDonalds? Not Eminem, Jay-Z, or Nas. I could see Lil' Wayne.",Curious to dive deeper
791," I could too haha. Muhammed Ali is regarded as a hip hip pioneer because of the poems he wrote, he probably did not talk about mcdonalds though haha",Curious to dive deeper
791," Definitely not. Did you know after the US, France is second largest hip hop market in the world? I remember Tony Parker, the NBA player put out a rap album in French.",Curious to dive deeper
791," that is very interesting, I wonder why it caught on so well in france but nowhere else?",Curious to dive deeper
791," I don't think NBA player's do well with music, but I think the reason is that he's actually French himself. Hip Hop is usually about your culture so it would make sense.",Curious to dive deeper
791," that is true I suppose, Hip hop really exploded here in america though, very different culture than most places",Curious to dive deeper
791," Yes, especially in New York City, my favorite place. Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens were huge for hip-hop. Followed by California.",Curious to dive deeper
791," That is for sure, do you appreciate rapping or DJing more?",Curious to dive deeper
791,Rapping for sure. DJing isn't really as much as skill as it used to be. You?,Curious to dive deeper
791," I agree with you, I almost feel like we are being close to not having any more rap beats left to make without getting very complex, I was thinking about that the other day",Curious to dive deeper
791," It's so true. I just heard that new Cardi B song that samples ""I like it like that"". Like that's what they are down to using lol. You read any good books recently?",Curious to dive deeper
791," I like to read some of CS Lewis' work, he was a great guy, pretty much invented the ""you laugh you lose"" challenge",Curious to dive deeper
791,It's funny in the 18th century people were worried about the spread of the reading of novels,Curious to dive deeper
791," that is true, makes you wonder what our choices will look like years from now!",Curious to dive deeper
791," I don't know. I hope they read though, I think the complex cognitive process is a useful exercise for the brain.",Neutral
791," Oh for sure, I think just basic communication is important, and comprehension of language is too, unfortunately it is not taught enough in our schools in my opinon, or not taught correctly",Curious to dive deeper
791," I agree. It requires practice at a young age. Even if it's just reading novels for fun, it's good for everyone.",Happy
791," I am surprised Ender's game was suggested reading for the Marines, I need to read that, I watched the movie, it was okay",Curious to dive deeper
792,Hi there! Hanging out today. Just got back from getting groceries. Love listening to music when I drive. Love hip-hop. It's hard to believe it has been around since the late 70's!,Happy
792," Awesome, I love hip-hop too. Hip-hop music has a large vocabulary of any popular genre of music.",Surprised
792," Yes, it does. In 2005 Mcdonalds paid hip hop artists when they mentioned Big Macs in their songs.",Curious to dive deeper
792,That is very smart of McDonald's and good publicity. Muhamed Ali was actually regarded as one of the earliest pioneers in hip-hop.,Curious to dive deeper
792,I didn't know that. Was that before he was a boxer?,Curious to dive deeper
792,I would guess it was during although I'm not sure. The band Vanilla Ice who sang ice ice baby was the first hip-hop single to top the Billboard charts.,Surprised
792,I used to love that one.France is the second largest hip hop market in the world.,Surprised
792,Oh really that is surprising! It is commonly argued as to whether hip-hop started in the south or west Bronx. I think just saying it originated in the Bronx is good enough.,Surprised
792,I am sure. So I also like to read in addition to listen to music. Did you know that in the 18th century there was a moral panic because of the spread of the reading of novels?,Curious to dive deeper
792,Wow I would like to learn more about that. Reading is very powerful though it promotes deep exploration of tax during interpretation.,Neutral
792," I can see that. The world record for speed reading is held by Anee Jones with a rate of 4,700 words per minute.",Surprised
792,Wow that is amazing I don't even think I could do 1000 words per minute. I like to enjoy reading. Interestingly enough silent reading as a recent phenomenon.,Surprised
792,I don't either. OMG I can not imagine listening to people read out loud all the time. I would be crazy!!,Curious to dive deeper
792,Yeah that would be so annoying LOL. I love that even blind people can read to using braille.,Happy
792,I do too. I was amazed as a kid when I heard about braille. Did you know that Starship Troopers is the first sci-fi novel on the reading list of three of the five US military branches?,Surprised
792,Oh no I didn't know that that is very cool. I should read that book. The creator of Game of Thrones begin writing by selling monster stories for pennies to other neighborhood children. Look at him now.,Surprised
792," Oh, that's funny. I wonder how old he was when he did that?",Curious to dive deeper
792,Yeah good question I don't know. President Andrew Johnson never actually attended school his wife helped him learn math and reading. What a good partner.,Surprised
792,Hard to believe that was a non-issue. Good thing reading success is measured as comprehension. His must have been high.,Happy
792,Yeah I agree with you I bet it was. Do you ever read comic books? Marvel once spent 10 years convincing the US government that X men are not human LOL.,Surprised
792,I did when I was a kid. I know Michigan State University's library  has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world. Nice chatting with you! Bye!,Surprised
793," Hi, do you love or hate comic books.",Neutral
793,I like them. I'm getting a bit tired of the comic book movies though.,Neutral
793,I can still handle the movies because they are just fun events but the tv series have become annoying.,Neutral
793," Yeah, the TV series is definitely overkill. What did they make a TV series into? ",Curious to dive deeper
793," If you check Netflix you will find many different series both Marvel and DC comic stories. The first season of ""The Punisher' was great but I could not finish the second season. Way too much like a soap opera.",Neutral
793,Interesting. Well I do like some of the movies. Apparently the Michigan State University library has the biggest publicly available comic bookd collection inthe world.,Curious to dive deeper
793," I do like good movie with a ""super hero"" and a ""super villain"" I can root against. That is the beauty of the Marvel comic book movies.",Neutral
793,Did you happen to catch the movie Glass? It just came out.,Curious to dive deeper
793," No yet, I love the director so I am going to make sure I see that movie. The last super hero movie that have have seen was Aqua man. ",Neutral
793," Interesting, I never saw that. Glass is ok, but I liked Unbreakable more. ",Curious to dive deeper
793,I have seen Unbreakable. It surprises me that Glass was only just Ok since it was directed by M Knight Shamala.,Neutral
793," Yeah. BTW, did you know that Tom Hardy recorded his own hip hop mixtape? ",Curious to dive deeper
793,That sounds interesting. I wonder why it took so long to release his mixtape.,Neutral
793," I'm not sure, have you seen any movies with him in it? ",Curious to dive deeper
793,I have not seen venom yet but it looks like a fun movie.,Neutral
793," Yeah, it does. I saw the batman movie where he played Bane. ",Curious to dive deeper
793,He is a good actor and plays well in the comic book genre. It is too bad Stan Lee died but he lived a good long life.,Neutral
793,Yeah it is he passed away. Did you happen to see Starship troopers?,Curious to dive deeper
793," Yes, I was suprised that it became a cult classic. I found it a badly acted B movie when it first came out but I guess the military types like it because it is very pro military. ",Neutral
793," I thought it was campy, but I never read the book. Did you read it? ",Curious to dive deeper
793,Campy is the right word. It is not really my type of book. I like to read science fiction novels but more fantasy type stories.,Neutral
793," It's not a terrible movie. Anyways, nice chatting with you. ",Curious to dive deeper
794,howdy there how are you doing today? has it been a good day for you? do you feel like a superhero?,Neutral
794," Yes, I do! lol How about you today? Are you a Batman fan?",Curious to dive deeper

794,That is true.He grew up and became a true hero! Who was your favorite Batman?,Curious to dive deeper
794," um, which ones were there? michael keaton, val kilmer, george clooney...",Neutral
794," Yes, I was thinking of those three also. Michael Keaton is my favorite! Michelle Pfeiffer is my favorite catwoman!!",Curious to dive deeper
794,she was great. that suit must have been tough to put on though. ouch. she was really sexy though.,Neutral
794,Her face was perfect for a cat! Did you know Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises made over 1 billion worldwide.,Curious to dive deeper
794,did not know that. i guess that the world has a hunger for superhero films. the dark knight. was that chris nolan?,Neutral
794," That's right he was, he was good also. Have you seen pictures of the tower in Australia called Gotham Tower? ",Curious to dive deeper
794,no i have not. it sounds cool. does it look like something from batman? what city is it in?,Neutral
794,I'm sure of the city and yeah a resemblance of the tower in batman.,Curious to dive deeper
794,that sounds really cool. i should visit oz someday. what other kinds of entertainment do you like?,Neutral
794," NFL games, legally they are considered entertainment as the WWE is.",Neutral
794,that is interesting. that is not what i thought at all. i thought it was a sport since the outcome is not known before hand.,Neutral
794," Yes, I did too. Another name for female superhero is super heroine! who knew?",Surprised
794,do you have a favorite superheroine? wonderwoman? supergirl?,Neutral
794,Cat Woman! and you who is yours? If they had made Batman with Bill Murray ad Eddie Murphy I would expect to laugh. I just look at Bill Murray and he makes me laugh!,Curious to dive deeper
794," the man is a comic legend. he was going to become a doctor but blew it and ended up in comedy. anyway, great chat!",Neutral
794,I agree! There are 30 superhero movies coming between 2016-2020! Have a great day!,Surprised
794,you too. stay super!,Neutral
794," ha,ha,ha Good chat!",Happy

795," Hello, how are you? I do like Batman, all superheroes for that matter. What about you?",Curious to dive deeper
795," yes me too, I enjoy the movies a lot. do you know who created it?",Curious to dive deeper
795,I believe it was created in the 40s by Bob Kane and Bill Finger.,Neutral
795,Cool. Universal studios was going to build a gotham city themed park,Curious to dive deeper
795,That would have been cool.  There have been so many variations of batman over the years. Do you have a favorite?,Curious to dive deeper
795," I am not sure if I have a favorite, I like them in general. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
795," I would agree, I Like them all but I would say I am partial to the Dark knight trilogy.",Curious to dive deeper
795,nice. did you know smallville was planned to be a show about bruce wayne becoming batman?,Curious to dive deeper
795," No. I did not know that, that is interesting. I wonder why they went with superman. Did you know that there are over 300 registered superheroes in the US?",Curious to dive deeper
795,that is a lot. How much do you think is the cost of collateral damage from superheroes?,Curious to dive deeper
795,Oh man easily in the millions.,Surprised
795,yeah. there were plans for a comic series to fix that damage,Curious to dive deeper
795,No one cares how it gets fixed I guess. Did you know that there is actually a superhero called Normalman. He was the only one on a planet without powers.,Curious to dive deeper
795,I wonder why he was invented in the first place,Surprised
795," I don't know, but what help would he be able to offer. No wonder it was not popular. Besides  superheroes what else do you do for entertainment?",Curious to dive deeper
795," I play video games, do you like them?",Curious to dive deeper
795," Yes I have been playing since I was a kid, on the original Nintendo.",Curious to dive deeper

796,Amazing. There is a town in alaska that has a cat as its mayor since 1997.,Happy
796," Mayor , well that's something to be checked. may be because of it natural hunting ability lol",Surprised
796,Lol. That town probably has like 11 citizens or something like that. Wonder how the cat tells them what decision he has made.,Happy

799,Robert Oppenheimer sure changed  history and is a curious character of history,Curious to dive deeper
799," He sure was a character. It would be interesting to read ""American Prometheus"".",Surprised
799," I agree, it received a Pulitzer so it must be a really informative book for sure, ",Curious to dive deeper
799,Many have the question of what goes on inside a man who contributed so much to the killing of so much people! and his cool attitude towards it.,Curious to dive deeper
799," It would be an interesting read for sure, he did led the development of nuclear weapons, the same ones that were dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki",Sad
799," there is another book about him, called Trinity, but I thing that one has a lot of fiction and mixed reviews",Curious to dive deeper
799," That would be an interesting read as well, its amazing how you can go from hero to villain in a simple lapse of time, I guess Oppenheimer was both at the same time",Curious to dive deeper
799,today reading is considered very healthy but did you know that in the 18th century was not like that. There was literal panic because the spread of reading novels!,Surprised
799," I didnt, although info is a weapon I guess giving people books could have an effect on society specially back then. ",Curious to dive deeper

799," Who knows, but did you know what they did to achieve a beautiful curly heir in the main character of the movie brave?",Curious to dive deeper
799," Yeah I heard they spend 3 years studying physics in order to achieve that, they had to get it right and apparently that wasnt an easy feat.",Curious to dive deeper
799," That is cool, they really achieved a beautiful hair. So much to do about studying, reading and writing. for example I did not know that Julius Caesar wrote Hercules is his youth",Curious to dive deeper
799," Thats interesting, I guess there are many facts to be discovered yet, are you a fan of fiction novels?",Curious to dive deeper
799,I love reading fiction and non-fiction. I love that reading encourages imagination. It helps with analysis and creativity,Curious to dive deeper
799,Yeah reading can be pretty good and enhance the mind.,Curious to dive deeper

800,I can't either.  Reading success is reading comprehension not glazing over words.,Neutral
800,Very true. Well who knew Kim jong-un has a degree in physics!,Surprised
800," I certainly didn't.  Physics is so broad and yet so important as a topic.  I mean, Pixar studied the physics of curly hair just to get one of their character's hair right in the movie brave.",Neutral
800," I know, that surprises me. That's alot of time on curly hair.",Surprised
800," It really is, especially just for an animated movie.  Then on the flip side you can think about the creation of the universe and say it could have come from nothing and not violated physics.",Neutral
800,That's a good way to put it. It is so vast and unbelievable.,Surprised
800," True.  With physics being so broad it is hard to see how you can study it.  Yet, it's one of the oldest academic disciplines, perhaps even the oldest.",Neutral
800," Yes, I agree, the oldest. Did you know there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters by their powers and abilities.",Curious to dive deeper
800,No I didn't.  Did you know that cyborgs aren't really all that modern?  Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest/first known example of one.,Neutral
800,I saw that and was surprised.. Military branches have a list of sci-fi novels to read and Starship Troopers is one of the first.,Curious to dive deeper
800,I've never read that but I think I saw the movie Starship Troopers.  Since fiction is any story of the imagination I guess that the author had a pretty good imagination!,Neutral
800,I would say so. Was it a good movie then?,Curious to dive deeper
800,It seems like it was if I remember right.  I am a fan of science fiction.  I heard about a judge trying to ban a comic back in the 50s because it had a black character. I'm very glad that we have progressed away from times like that.,Neutral
800,"  Oh, I agree with you. I like some science fiction In the 18th century they had a moral panic from reading novels. How sad is that!",Surprised
800,Definitely sad!  I wonder if they knew that Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of hercules and oedipus when he was young!,Neutral
800," Really, Now that's interesting Its been a nice chat!",Happy
800,On the other hand George RR Martin hates fan fiction.,Neutral
801,Do you play any instruments?,Neutral
801,In fact I do! The violin. Funny story. My dad loved the 3 Stooges and had seen one of the stooges play violin and wanted me to play because of that!,Happy
801,How long have you played the violin? Is the 3 stooges a play?,Curious to dive deeper
801,I've played for at least 10 years.  Three stooges - old time comedic trio.  Black and white movies.  Slapstick humor.  You could probably find them on the internet and find a bunch of clips.   You spend a lot of time on the internet?,Neutral
801,You are very talented! Comedic trio when it's musical? That is interesting. I would love to watch those kind of movies. I,Neutral
801," Well, the movies weren't musicals really.  Just one of them, Larry Fine was musically inclined.  ",Neutral
801,Are they silenced films?,Neutral
801,No.  They started in Vaudeville but I think the peak of their popularity was in the late 30s early 40s.  You know who else was a violinist?  Albert Einstein.  I was pretty surprised to learn that.,Surprised
801,No wonder Albert Einstein was a prodigy and a genius!!!,Neutral
801," Right?  So many skills in one man, you'd think he might have been a robot!  But then again, another human would have had to have been smarter than THAT to program him.  Ha!",Surprised
801," His mind is imaginative and seems so unrealistic. You already know he is a mad genius. Speaking of robots, they can be controlled by rat brains. That is insane.",Neutral
801,OMG!   That is pretty insane.  So the rat make it go search for cheese? Ha!  Here's another insane robot fact.  Did you know Michael Jackson had planned to build a 50 foot tall moon walking robot?,Curious to dive deeper
801," However, it is the robot looking for cheese. I think I would be down to have a rat robot as a pet for a day. Well, where is this 50 foot tall moon walking robot then?",Curious to dive deeper
801,Don't think he ever got to it but it was supposed to be roaming around the desert sands of las vegas.  I'd find that freaky.  Did you ever watch that show Mythbusters?  They used to make a lot of robot things on that show to test things.,Curious to dive deeper
801,For a second I thought you meant ghost busters. Why did they stop the show?,Curious to dive deeper
801," Ha!  I liked Ghostbusters too.  Not sure why they stopped Mythbusters.  Did you know one of the guys on the show, Grant Imahara, created Craig Ferguson's (former talk show host on CBS) robot sidekick?",Curious to dive deeper
801," The theme song is funny and catchy. That is weird. If I had a robot by my side, I would cry. I feel like one day robots will destroy and rule the set.",Curious to dive deeper
801,I'm sure people have theories on whether or not robots could take over the world!  Could probably look some of those theories up on the internet.  Amazing what you'll find on the World Wide Web.,Surprised
801,Conspiracies on YouTube are everywhere. I hope that does not exist though.,Curious to dive deeper
801," Yeah, some of the stuff you find on internet is useless stuff.  But some of it's important, like that stuff you're supposed to read when buying products or services online.  In all honesty though, I don't think a lot of people read that.",Neutral
801,It was nice chatting with you. Have a good day!,Neutral
801,Same to you. Don't let the robots get you!,Neutral
801,That is funny.,Neutral
802,hi how are you? do you like the internet?,Neutral
802," Yeah, I use it almost every day.",Neutral
802,I feel it has become too much of our lives. i wonder if it is harming our health in any way.,Neutral
802,Yeah I wonder about that too.  Data privacy is a big issue.  With so many different individuals and corporations on the internet it's difficult to know what is being done with our data.  Only a small percentage actually read a product's or service's full terms before buying it on the internet.,Neutral
802,i heard it was 7 percent but im surprised that its that high. i thought it would be about 1 percent frankly. most people dont think about their data.,Neutral
802,The internet can be addicting too.  The constant novelty is dangerous.  I find it hard sometimes to stop using the internet on my phone.,Neutral
802,I think that we want constant stimulation. this is not natural. we cannot be constantly stimulated like rats in an experiment.,Neutral
802,Did you know robots can be controlled by rat brains?,Curious to dive deeper
802," im not surprised. rats are quite clever, and i guess if scientists understand the rat brain, then they can wire up the interface. cool.",Neutral
802," I'm all for technology being used to enhance our lives, such as robots being able to debone a chicken.  But it's more like the internet is controlling us now.",Neutral
802," yes, the internet is deboning our minds. it is pulling us apart. plus it is ubiquitous. ",Neutral
802," Yeah, the internet is even available on mt, everest!",Surprised
802,i guess for everyone that needs to take a selfie on the peak and upload it to the cloud.,Neutral
802,That sounds like something I would like to do.  It'd be better than sitting on the computer and surfing the web.,Neutral
802," yes, i wish i had the courage to climb a mountain but it sounds too risky. maybe if a robot carried me up to the peak of everest, i would go.",Neutral
802,But I hope robots don't influence us to be more lazy.,Fearful
802," that is a concern. as robots do more jobs, what will people do? just sit and stare? will they exercise? i hope so.",Neutral
802," Yeah, it seems like a bad combination, if for instance, robots take over almost every physical task for us, and we end up sitting at the computers becoming addicted to and slaves to the internet.",Fearful
802," yes, we would entertain ourselves to death. the creativity and initiative that made the robots would disappear from humanity. a tragedy.",Neutral
802," With the death of our creativity, then maybe artificial intelligence would become the new intelligence.  All we would need to do is be mindless consumers and provide input so artificial intelligence can grow.",Fearful
802," the AI would break away and leave this planet. we would be left behind. typing conversations into computers and desperately try to make contact with other human beings. anyway, great chat!",Neutral
802," Yeah, I appreciate your time.  Have a good day.",Happy
803," Hi, how are you?",Happy
803,I'm doing well.  How are you today?,Happy
803,I'm great!,Happy
803," I'm having a problem with my kid's smelly gym shoes, I've read that putting dry tea bags in the shoes will absorb the odors.  Have you ever tried that?",Curious to dive deeper
803,I have and it does work.,Happy
803," Cool, I'm going to try it then.  You know you read about some of these remedies and wonder if they really work or not.  Especially if you read it on the internet. Of course I hear that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes, if you can believe that.lol",Surprised
803," Yeah, I know what you mean. Wow, that is crazy! I've heard that ballet dancers go through four pairs of pointe shoes in a week! ",Surprised
803,That is quite a bit of dancing in a week to go through 4 pairs of shoes.  Wow!,Surprised
803,I know right!,Happy
803," Have you ever heard of the store in Alabama, that only sells clothes, cameras, etc. found in unclaimed baggage at airports?",Curious to dive deeper
803," Wow, and that is legal?",Surprised
803," Yes, apparently so.  I wonder if anybody bought my pair of size 6 Calvin Klein jeans that was in my luggage and got lost back in 1985. lol Stephon Marbury promoted a line of shoes that retailed for $15.00 and he was not paid to endorse them.  Can you believe that?",Surprised
803,Those shoes must have been great. I seen on the news that a Steve Smith a nfl wide receiver leaves his cleats on the field so he can raise awareness to homeless people that don't have shoes.,Happy
803," I saw that, it promotes a good cause.  Kudos to him.  Do you know there are some people that will look for collar gaps on your clothes just to tell if you have your clothes tailored or not?  Isn't that insane with homeless people that have no shoes to wear.",Surprised
803," That is strange. Oh! I don't know if you have learned about this in history, but apparently Pilgrims wore colorful clothes and only wore black on special occasions. ",Happy
803," Yeah, I had heard about that.  But show me one picture with a Pilgrim wearing something colorful, they must have had nothing but special occasions every day.  ",Surprised
803,Haha I know!,Happy
803," Speaking of clothing, did you know that Apple had a clothing line back in 1986?",Curious to dive deeper
803," No, I had no idea, but of course I wasn't alive then. lol",Happy
803," Oh, poor baby, you're telling your age!  It must have did poorly or it would still be around.",Surprised
803," Yeah, I wonder what it looked like. Speaking of Apple, if you smoke around their computers it voids the warranty because it's considered a biohazard!",Surprised
803," I can totally see that.  Smoking wrecks everything it comes in contact with.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you today, but I need to go walk my dog.  Have a good day.",Happy
804," Hi, how are you?",Happy
804,I am doing okay. I hope you are well. Are you someone who owns a lot of shoes?,Curious to dive deeper
804," I have some, but only have a rotation of like 4 pair. Im not a materialist person...",Happy
804,I'm not overall but I do love shoes. Were you aware that there are at least 17 ways to tie your shoes?,Curious to dive deeper
804," No, I was not. I did know Stephon marbury promoted a line of shoes that retailed at $15. he was not paid to endorse them.",Happy
804,I wish all shoes were that cheap. Apparently Bill Nye the science guy holds a patent for ballet pointe shoes.,Curious to dive deeper
804,Really! That's weird. Speaking of shoes... Nfl wide receiver steve smith leaves his cleats on the field after every game to raise awareness to homeless people without shoes,Surprised
804,That's a nice sentiment on his part. There are wizard of oz inspired shoes that actually guide you home when you click your heels together using a gps system. That's pretty amazing and fun.,Happy
804,That would be good for kids. We could always find them at least.,Surprised
804,That is true. Queen elizabeth ii employs somebody to wear her shoes before her to ensure they are comfortable. That's some real power she has.,Surprised
804,I am a weirdo so I would never let anyone wear my shoes before me. Get me a robot to do that!,Surprised
804,Ha ha. You always need a good outfit to go with your shoes.A man wore 70 items of clothing in a chinese airport to avoid the bagging charge. That's innovation.,Happy
804,Reminds me of when Joey put all of Chandler's clothes on during Friends. I am not proud of myself for that knowledge...,Sad
804,Ha ha. I saw a lot of Friends but do not remember that scene. The greeks literally made asbestos clothing and it was almost as valuable as gold! I would imagine they became very ill.,Surprised
804,5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes.,Surprised
804,I'm not surprised. Current products are just not made to last.,Curious to dive deeper
804,yeah. Putting dry tea bags in smelly shoes or gym bags will absorb the unpleasant odor,Surprised
804," That makes sense. I'll have to try that. An african tribe still wears victorian clothes, the style of former German occupiers that they've made their own.",Curious to dive deeper
804,Rip curl makes clothes in north korea yet the label says made in china.,Surprised
804,WOW! That just seems lazy and as if there is no oversight.,Surprised
804,Nice chatting with you.,Happy
805," hi, do you have a favorite kind of shoe?",Curious to dive deeper
805," No, not particularly. I like wingtips. What about you?",Neutral
805," I like running shoes, so comfortable",Curious to dive deeper
805,Stephon Marbury promoted  shoes that retailed at $15. but was not paid to endorse them. I wonder what kind of shoes they were.,Curious to dive deeper
805,Yeah that is strange that someone would promote shoes and not get paid for it,Curious to dive deeper
805,Maybe he was hoping that the shoes would go to people that needed them. Maybe he has another source of income that's adequate. I don't know.,Neutral
805,that would explain it for sure. do you watch ballet?,Curious to dive deeper
805,Not really a fan. It looks painful.,Neutral
805,yeah it does and they go through 4 pairs of shoes a week,Curious to dive deeper
805," I'm not surprised. It looks like they are hard on the shoes. I wonder how they would do with the 5,000 year old shoes, which are supposed to be better than modern ones.",Curious to dive deeper
805," yeah, I would like to have a pair of those.",Curious to dive deeper
805," If they had an unpleasant odor, you could just put teabags in there. Probably not 5,000 year old teabags though.",Neutral
805," hahaa yeah not those, but it is amazing how they work so well",Curious to dive deeper
805,I'm impressed that Steve Smith leaves his cleats on the field after every game to raise awareness about homeless people,Happy
805," I think that is a good approach to it. how about clothes, do you have a favorite type?",Curious to dive deeper
805,Don't really have a favorite. I wonder about Apple's line of clothing. Who wore that? Computer geeks?,Curious to dive deeper
805,hahahah that is a good point. wonder what it was called?,Curious to dive deeper
805,I have no idea. But my guess is that it was not manufactured in North Korea.,Neutral
805,yup like rip curl who is north korean but made in china?,Curious to dive deeper
805,I don't think any company should be doing business with North Korea.,Neutral
805,yeah me neither nice chat,Happy
806," Hi, are you interested in or do you use computers?",Curious to dive deeper
806," Yea, it's fascinating how computers are able to process arithemetic and logical operations automatically",Neutral
806," Yes, modern computers have the ability to follow a generalized set of operations call programs. These programs allow computers do perform an extremely wide range of tasks.",Curious to dive deeper
806,It's crazy how computers are used in everything from microwave ovens to smartphones,Surprised
806," I know, right? Computers are used to control systems for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices like what you just said. In addition, they're in remote controls and  industrial robots.",Curious to dive deeper
806," I never knew captcha stood for completely automated public turning test to tell computers and humans apart, the name is annoying as the test",Surprised
806," Yes, or maybe it should be called ""gotcha"" for catching the bots that are always crawling online.  Did you know that the space shuttle's general purpose computer runs on only 1 MB of RAM. That seems strange to say the least. ",Curious to dive deeper
806," That does seem strange, did you know Ada Lovelace was the first person to write a computer algorithm?",Curious to dive deeper
806," Yes, she actually has a programming language named after her called ""Ada"".  That's way back in the beginning though.  Humans are capable of genius level of work and creativity.  Did you know that someone else built a working 16-bit computer using nothing but the basic Minecraft building blocks?",Curious to dive deeper
806,That's insane but it's probably much better than the manual cardboard computers Bell distributed to students in 1968,Surprised
806," No doubt. Also, did you know that in 1936, Russians made a computer that ran on water? No that would be cool to see how that worked.",Curious to dive deeper
806,That would be a sight. At Stanford the first google computer was housed in a lego enclosures,Neutral
806," Cool, that's funny.  Did you realize that some transhumanists want to upload their minds to computers and even memory sticks?",Curious to dive deeper
806," Yea, that's pretty crazy. I never knew in 1995 Doom was installed more than Windows 95",Surprised
806," I remember DOOM and Wolfenstein. That takes me back.  Actually did you know that if you smoke near an Apple Computer, it voids the warranty by making it 'a biohazard'? Smokers beware!",Curious to dive deeper
806,Lol I heard smoke being hard to get rid on clothes but not computers. Funny fact is people use to do laundry on old faithful,Neutral
806," That is funny. Actually, speaking about Apple, did you know that they have had a clothing line since 1986?  Good to know.",Curious to dive deeper
806," No, I had no clue. Did you know Miguel Cabarello designs Bulletproof clothing?",Neutral
806," Wow, did he have a good idea or what?  Wonders never cease.  Did you know that a certain store in Alabama only sells clothes, cameras, etc found in unclaimed baggage at airports.  Who would have thought of that one?",Curious to dive deeper
806,Much better idea than making clothes with Asbestos like the Ancient Greeks did,Neutral
806," Gee, I guess they didn't want to live that long. Its' been nice chatting with you. Have a good evening.",Neutral
807,Hello did you know that 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed?,Curious to dive deeper
807," I heard it but I'm skeptical.  That sounds far too high and what's the definition of ""natural.",Fearful
807,Not sure in this case.  When the earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long!,Curious to dive deeper
807," That was 5.5 hours of sunlit hell in magma and lava.  Bummer, they are saying we will be out of helium by the end of the century. ",Fearful
807," Yeah that would be crazy. If earths history was represented as a 24 hour period,  humans would only represent 1 min and 17 seconds lol Its sometimes so surprising how small we are in the universe. ",Curious to dive deeper
807," Yeah, the sheer distances give me that feeling. The UN actually has an official ambassador to ETs.  ",Curious to dive deeper
807," I read that,  that just covinces me more that we are not alone.",Curious to dive deeper
807,I don't remember Google going down for 5 minutes in 2013?  It took 40% of web traffic down.  I probably blamed my ISP.,Surprised
807,That is crazy!  I bet people were so confused lol I dont remember it as well.,Curious to dive deeper
807," Wow, a single Google search requires more computing power than what it took to send Neil Armstrong and 11 others to the moon!",Surprised
807,That is surprising!  Wow everytime I google search I could be sending someone to the moon instead lol,Curious to dive deeper
807,Ha.  I guess Google once used goats instead of people to mow the lawns.  I can't imagine what a hassle it would have been to manage all the goats.  They are mischievous creatures that eat EVERYTHING.,Surprised
807," lol true,  thats the new thing in Caifornia now,  hiring goats to eat your lawn,  I see it everywhere,  I think its great as long as they are managed by someone lol",Curious to dive deeper
807,Recent readings have confirmed what I always suspected:  woman are more likely to own an iPhone.  I'm a dude and I've owned one.  Android now...,Neutral
807,I had the iphone 4 a long time ago and now I have the android lol,Curious to dive deeper
807," It seems that with Apple, there are too many strings attached forcing you to use their stuff.  ",Disgusted
807," I know right,  all there stuff has to go together like you are hooked into buying everything they own.  Its really annoying ",Curious to dive deeper
807,I guess that's why we went Android?  Funny Jobs switched iPhones during presentation because they would run out of power and RAM.,Surprised
807,Lol right!  I love android its so simple.  Thats a fail lol it cant even last a presentation without running out of ram lol,Curious to dive deeper
807,I think the irreplaceable battery on iPhone hurt their market.  Funny Microsoft had funeral for the death of the iPhone when it launched their own line.,Surprised
807,lol Nice!,Curious to dive deeper
807,I had a MS phone and it was really good but lack of available  SW kind of ruined it.,Neutral
807,Sorry to hear.  its been great talking to you.,Curious to dive deeper
808,Did you see Crazy Rich Asians?,Curious to dive deeper
808,No I haven't.  I heard it was good.,Neutral
808,I have not yet either but I am aware of it's cultural impact. It was made from a novel. Apparently it is a very good romantic comedy.,Curious to dive deeper
808," My mother like it.  I think it stars Michelle Yeoh, Henry Golding and Constance Wu, right?",Neutral
808,It does. Apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy. His mother rejects her due to her less affluent background.,Curious to dive deeper
808," If I remember correctly, Jon M Chu is the director.",Neutral
808,Yes he is. It was also the first movie to feature an all-Asian cast in Hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and I'm glad that it did well. Asians seem very underrepresented in film.,Happy
808," The movie is 121 minutes long, which is just right and is PG-13.",Neutral
808,That makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more Asian-Americans can see themselves represented on screen.,Happy
808," Well, lets switch topics.  Are you a science person., Earth is the 3rd planet from the Sun.  It is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life. ",Curious to dive deeper
808," I am a little. I enjoy learning about it. I was aware of those facts. I also know that if we viewed the entire earth's history as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day. That is a mind blowing stat. ",Surprised
808,This is mind blowing.  Thank God for Jupiter.  It saves Earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us.,Happy
808,That is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas. We do not even know if there is any solid land there. I wonder how it takes the impact first in this case?,Surprised
808,It's very interesting.  So is the fact that the Sun is 4x less dense than Earth.,Surprised
808,I know it is much larger but i don't think it has any solidity to it so that's interesting. Another science fact is that when Earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long.,Surprised
808,I didn't know that.  I wonder why. There is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet.  It is the Hudson Bay region of Canada.,Surprised
808,I wonder how much affect that has? Is it enough to change weights in any way? I wonder. I do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century.,Curious to dive deeper
808," Really, I hope that is ok for us?  I'm also a big tech guy, how about you?  Did you know new Google employees are called ""nooglers"".",Surprised
808,I did not. What a silly name ha ha.,Happy
808," Yes, and they have to wear a propeller hat on their first day.",Happy
808,That is even more silly.,Surprised
809,I have always loved reading. I think that reading has always been a gateway to knowledge for me.,Happy
809,Yes and knowledge is power. I mostly listen to audio books now though. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
809,I love audiobooks. Did you know that in the first 3 months of 2016 audiobook sales rose 35%?!,Surprised
809,I can believe it! I'm suprised with the rise of technology that there are more libraries than there are McDonald in the US.,Curious to dive deeper
809,I think that libraries provide technology access to people who aren't fortunate enough to have it at home.,Curious to dive deeper
809," I agree, im in one right now. lol! ",Curious to dive deeper
809," I think the concept of a ""library of things"" is amazing. Allowing people to check out other things, such as sewing machines, or seeds, is wonderful. Allows short term usage rather than a long term commitment. ",Curious to dive deeper
809,Yeah that's a neat concept. You know there was a man falsely accused and spent 10 years working on his proving innocence.,Curious to dive deeper
809,I think Law Libraries in Prisons are wonderful,Happy
809," I do too, something for them to elevate there minds. If you publish a book in Norway the government will but 1000 copies.",Curious to dive deeper
809,That is very interesting. I wish I had learned braile. I think that would be a very interesting tactile way to read.,Curious to dive deeper
809,Apparently Michael Jackson released an audio book. Did you know that?,Curious to dive deeper
809,I had no idea!,Curious to dive deeper
809," Yeah and steven spielberg directed it for ET, however that works",Curious to dive deeper
809,Had you heard that Jim Dale performed 300 voices for the Harry Potter books?,Surprised
809,Yeah he had to be reminded of them ever time they were on set. that's a lot of voice overs.,Curious to dive deeper
809,Audiobooks were initially started as a project to help those that are blind. I love to listen to them while I drive though! They are so useful!,Surprised
809,Man i listen to them when i'm doing just about anything. I hear in that same year were sale rose that e-book sales declined.,Curious to dive deeper
809,I can believe that. I would much rather have an audiobook over e book.,Neutral
809,Me too! Wow there were quite a few stars who narrated the dungeons and dragons character Diizzt do'urden.,Curious to dive deeper
809,I saw that! I am not sure who that is though.,Curious to dive deeper
810,My favorite book is Starship troopers. Have you read that book?,Curious to dive deeper
810," Hmm, sounds familiar but I haven't. Is it sci-fi? I love to read and have done some writing myself, including sci-fi.",Curious to dive deeper
810," Yes, sci-fi. I didnt know that its on the list of reading materials for some of the us military. ",Surprised
810,I'll have to look it up then if that is suggested for them. Seems like the Art of War would be more appropriate. Speaking of Sci-fi. Did you know Michael Jackson released an audiobook/soundtrack album for E.T.?,Surprised
810," No, i didnt! I love that movie! ",Happy
810," Yes, one of my favorites of all time. I wonder if people check out the DVD from the library. I heard that many libraries now carry video games to attract teenagers inside. Book checkouts have increased due to the seeing books on the shelf on the way to the games section.",Surprised
810,Some library's do! I know that the one next to my house does!,Surprised
810," Really??? I wish mine did. Which games? I bet not GTA 5. Speaking of teenagers, a Malawian teenager taught himself how to build a watermill out of junk to power his village.",Surprised
810,Most are pretty family friendly. But theyre free so thats not bad.,Surprised
810,I bet minecraft. I used to teach in a computer lab in middle school. I encouraged the kids to play minecraft instead of boring test taking skills. I told the students to switch the screens real quick when the principal would come in.,Happy
810,Almost all kids are into that game! I like that libraries are still around. Theres one in California that even checks out sewing machines and stuff.,Happy
810," I read articles years ago that they were starting to consider shutting libraries down but now with computer access they are becoming more popular than ever. I use the free wifi to download movies on my phone from Prime. I have completely cut the cable at home, no tv, no dish, no cable, no wifi. I just stream from my phone offline now. In the library of Alexandria they would take original copies of books and copy them putting the originals in the Library for safe keeping.",Surprised
810,I have cut all of my stuff as well. I feel like i should read more to get close to the record of 4700 words per minute.,Surprised
810,I tried speed reading. It can be done but it takes the fun out of it. And it is not relaxing. It is like driving a race car through a park and finishing it in 30 seconds as opposed to walking for 30 minutes enjoying nature.,Happy
810,I wish i could speed read! I think its crazy that people in the 18th century had a panic over the spread of novels.,Happy
810," Well, they had a panic over the spread of comic books originally too. They thought they were making kids violent and wanted to ban them like wanted to Elvis's singing and today's video games. Do you read Audio Books? I heard Dotrice narrated 224 different characters for the Game of Thrones audiobook.",Surprised
810,i know it seems like a panic over nothing. I didnt know that. Ive actually never seen games of thrones.,Happy
810,I had to stop watching it because my wife doesn't like violent shows and would get mad.. Now all I watch with her is chick flick shows like Covert Affairs and Mozart in the Jungle. What shows  you like?,Sad
810,I watch too much Parking Wars. Im addicted to seeing people get upset getting parking tickets.,Happy
810," I saw one about a Towing Company. But I think that was a different one. There was a funny one about them trying to get a guys car who was doing Karate on one of the male drivers when the black female tow driver came up behind him with a wrench and knocked him out. She said ""He may know ka-rah-tay...but I know cra-cra."" I laughed my head off.",Happy
810,Those shows are mind numbingly good. You have a great day!,Happy
810,You too!,Happy
810,thanks,Happy
811," Hey do you like to read? One of my favorite books is The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe and the author of that book, CS Lewis, used to have ""you laugh you lose"" competitions with ready bad poetry.",Neutral
811," I do like to read, CS lewis is a great author although I like audio books better. ",Curious to dive deeper
811," I'm sorry I meant ""reading"" and typed ready. Audio books are great too. They originally started out a a project for the blind.",Surprised
811,Did you know when it got started? Jim Dale is a great audiobook narrator,Curious to dive deeper
811,I'm not sure. And yeah he's done 300 voices for the Harry Potter audiobooks.,Surprised
811," He had playback recording to remember each of the voices, he is really skilled. ",Curious to dive deeper
811," Very smart. In 2016, audiobook sales rose 35%. People found it's a great way to multitask.",Happy
811," I do too, I like to listen to audiobook on the way to work and also when I am working. ",Curious to dive deeper
811," Me too, but mainly when I go for long walks or while exercising.Michael Jackson even released an audiobook directed by Spielberg for ET.",Surprised
811,Yeah even Michael Jackson released an audiobook and Weird Al Yancovich did so as well with Wil Wheaton and other artists.,Curious to dive deeper
811,I was surprised to learn that there are more libraries than McDonald's in the US. I would have though the opposite.,Surprised
811," I know right, there is a McDonalds pretty much everywhere, did you hear about the man that studied law while falsely imprisoned. ",Curious to dive deeper
811," Yeah, he studied law over 10 years and proved his innocence. Later he became a lawyer to help free those who have been falsely accused. Very admirable.",Surprised
811," It is, many would just cry the sentence out but he did something with his time there kind of like forced college. ",Curious to dive deeper
811," If there's a will, there's a way and with some determination and perseverance anything can be accomplished.",Neutral
811," Yeah I guess so, reading is a good way to accomplish it you can learn so much, too bad many kids prefer watching movies and wasting time now a days. ",Curious to dive deeper
811," Yeah they just aren't being taught the value of reading. In the 18th Century there was a moral panic because of the spread of the reading of novels, now there is smart phone panic.",Sad
811," Yeah there seems to be one, I hope that changes one day, on a positive note smartphones are useful for audiobooks so not everything is bad. ",Curious to dive deeper
811," Yes and books can be read on smartphones. Did you know that there is a library of things? Patrons can check out items that they need now, but not for long term.",Surprised
811," I didnt know that, that is and interesting concept, a library of things, nice. I bet its really popular. ",Curious to dive deeper
811,I would go if I were in Sacramento! Great chat! Have a good day.,Happy
811," Yeah that would be a great idea, its been great chatting with you also, I'm going to read a book now maybe go to the local library bye. ",Curious to dive deeper
812,Hi there! Do you use Google search?,Curious to dive deeper
812,All the time... Do you remember it going down for 5 minutes in 2013?  It took 40% of web traffic with it.  I probably thought is was on my end...,Curious to dive deeper
812,Really? I don't remember that! I probably thought the same thing! It's hard to believe Google has been around since 1998. I think that we've come such a long way since then!,Curious to dive deeper
812,They are huge.  They have grown and changed with the times although I don't like their political stuff.  Did you know a single Google search takes more computing power than it took to send Armstrong and 11 others to the moon?  Powerful slide rules back then...,Surprised
812," Oh wow, no I wasn't aware of that either! I do know that instead of hiring people to mow google's lawn, the company once used hundreds of live goats!",Curious to dive deeper
812,Hate to get that vet bill.  Goats will eat anything including cans.  Do you use an iPhone?,Curious to dive deeper
812,I don't use an iPhone. I've never been able to afford one. Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
812,They are overpriced.  I had one several years ago.  I'm Android now. I guess women are more likely to own them.,Surprised
812," Oh that's interesting! I wonder if it's because of money, or maybe because women tend to be more trendy than men. Or what!?",Curious to dive deeper
812," I think it's the ""cool"" factor among peers.  Funny, MS had a funeral for iPhones when they launched their line of phones.",Surprised
812," It's interesting that during the first iPhone presentation, Steve Jobs had to keep switching phones behind his desk, otherwise the phone would run out of ram and crash.",Surprised
812,I never liked that the iPhone didn't have a user-replaceable battery. That and there are so many strings attached with Apple -- they make you buy their stuff.,Disgusted
812,Oh yeah. That's why I prefer the most functional yet the cheapest phone I could find. Were you aware that more than 80% of the Earth's natural forests have already been destroyed?,Curious to dive deeper
812,I heard that but it sounds really high.  I'm very skeptical of such claims as science has become very political.  I am concerned about another such claim: helium will run out this century.,Curious to dive deeper
812," Yeah a lot of things like that can change. It shouldn't be a problem for humans or other life. For example, when earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long. We can handle some rates of change, hopefully.",Curious to dive deeper
812," What about the balloon industry?  Oh the horror.  Since my political awareness, the sky has been falling down for one reason or another.  Sick of lies from the media.  It's funny that the UN has an official ambassador for ETs.",Disgusted
812," I agree! I'd rather not be represented by someone I don't even know, to aliens! That pretty crazy! I just found out that Google maps calculates traffic by tracing how fast android devices are moving on the road!",Surprised
812,That's clever but a little disconcerting.  I guess our poles are mostly covered in ice.  I was thinking snow...,Surprised
812," Oh yes, and Earth's surface is about 71% covered with water, mostly by oceans! I can't help but love science, myself.",Curious to dive deeper
812,I love it too.  I'm an engineer and watch a lot of science documentaries.  I have recently learned that Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System.  I actually thought that honor belonged to Mercury.,Surprised
812," Oh I love science documentaries! I find it difficult to watch anything that isn't a documentary! Hey, it's been great talking with you! I hope you have a great day!",Happy
812," Yes, and get those floaty balloons while you can! You were an excellent chat partner!",Neutral
813,Are you a fan of reading?,Curious to dive deeper
813,Yes i am.  I like to read a lot of different types but in particular science fiction.  You?,Neutral
813," I like them too, I like reading books then watching the movie. Like starship troopers, ever read that?",Curious to dive deeper
813,I haven't read it but i've heard that its on the reading lists of most of the military.  Have you read it?,Neutral
813," I have, the book is better but the movie did a good job portraying the brutality",Curious to dive deeper
813,Cool. A book that i really want to read is Ender's game. Iv',Neutral
813," I haven't read that one, I think that is on the military's reading list also. Movie too maybe?",Curious to dive deeper
813," Sorry, my sentence got cut off.  Yes, it's a great movie. I've seen it several times.  I'm interested in reading the book to see what the military is so interested in.",Neutral
813,for sure! Did you ever hear that CS Lewis and Tolkein used to hold a you laugh you lose poetry competition?,Curious to dive deeper
813,No I didn't.  I didn't even realize they knew each other.,Neutral
813," I didn't either, I would have loved to sit in and watch that. Do you listen to audiobooks at all?",Curious to dive deeper
813,Me too.  I have listened to a small few.  Now that we are talking about it I just might increase my number. The whole reason I haven't read ender's game is due to time constraints. An audiobook just might be the answer to that.,Neutral
813,I like to listen to them sometimes on my commute to work. Weird al has narrated a book,Curious to dive deeper
813,He has?  What kind of book was it?,Neutral
813,It was dungeons and dragons lol. Other famous people had some parts in it also,Curious to dive deeper
813," I've played dungeons and dragons before.  I just don't see a Weird Al connection lol!  Then again, maybe he changed his voice. ",Neutral
813," right lol, I am sure he did something funky, its weird al!",Curious to dive deeper
813,True.  Jim Dale did 300 different voices for the harry potter books so I guess it's possible.,Neutral
813," wow, I can't even fake 5 different voices to make my daughter laugh lol. I will have to check it out! It was so nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
813," Say, do you take your daughter to the library?  There are so many different things from books to dvds that can be found in one.",Neutral
813," She isn't of age quite yet, but I definitely will! Enjoy your day!",Curious to dive deeper
814,Have you ever been to a library?,Curious to dive deeper
814,I have been. Have you?,Curious to dive deeper
814," Yeah, I lost my library card a few weeks ago. Did you know the government of Norway will buy 1000 copys of a book that you publish if you live there? ",Curious to dive deeper
814," Wow! That might be worth the investment. Just set the price at $1,000 and youve made your money.",Happy
814," Yeah, that's crazy. There are more libraries than Mcdonalds in the US. ",Curious to dive deeper
814,Wow! I just listened to a Radiolab podcast about a library on the border of the US and Canada that serves as a place for people to meet their families at. Those with a one time visa and their parents without a visa to enter the US.,Happy
814," Nice, did you steve king was scared of bambi when younger? Hilarious.",Surprised
814,Was that his gateway movie into the horrow genre?,Curious to dive deeper
814," Good question, I'm not quite sure, it sounds like Bambi! LOL",Curious to dive deeper
814,A man spent 10 years of his life in jail studying to become a lawyer. He proved his innocence so I guess it worked.,Curious to dive deeper
814," Wow, so I guess he was better than the prosecutors, that's awesome!",Curious to dive deeper
814,Yeah. He went on to help others prove their innocence. Seems like a good cause.,Happy
814," yeah, he should have been a lawyer from the get go. I wonder how much he charges? ",Curious to dive deeper
814,A lot if he is a speed reader and can read at 4700 words per minute. Although that would not help his billable hours...,Curious to dive deeper
814," Wow, that is fast. How many books a day is that? ",Curious to dive deeper
814," More than I read, which is 1 per month...",Curious to dive deeper
814,That's pretty good. Did you know Ender's Game is suggested reading for Military Organizations? Seems sort of weird. I thought the movie sucked.,Curious to dive deeper
814,I never saw the movie. Didn't read the book either. Starship troopers was terrible. I did see that...,Sad
814," I thought it was campy, but I never read the book. It's been a long time since I've seen it though. ",Curious to dive deeper
814,Can you imagine a moral panic because of reading?,Surprised
814," No, it seems foreign to me. Anyways nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
815," Good morning, are you a fan of superheroes?",Curious to dive deeper
815," I love superheroes, I am big fan of all the movies and shows. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
815,I am as well. I prefer the Marvel movies to DC. Do you have a preference?,Curious to dive deeper
815," Me too, Marvel much better! Did you know there are 300 superheroes in the US",Curious to dive deeper
815,I did not know that. Does that mean there are people who have registered themselves as superheroes or trademarks?,Curious to dive deeper
815," I wonder if they register themselves. I registered myself, my name is normalman, just a average man",Curious to dive deeper
815,Have you seen any of the latest Marvel movies? I have not seen Captain Marvel yet.,Curious to dive deeper
815," I have not, looks interesting. I like anything Stan Lee so it should be good. What else do you do for entertainment?",Curious to dive deeper
815," I enjoy reading, listening to music and podcasts, and watching documentaries on Netflix. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
815," Nice! I still play old school nintendo from time to time, did you ever play that?",Curious to dive deeper
815,I wish I still had mine. The oldest system I still have is my SEGA Genesis.,Happy
815," nice, loved my a sega! Each had great games. I wonder how many colors the Sega had, Nintendo has only 54 colors.",Curious to dive deeper
815,I do not know. I recently got an XBox One that I won from a cereal box! Those contests do actually give out the prizes!,Surprised
815,no way! That would be awesome to win from just eating cereal! Which company did that?,Curious to dive deeper
815," It was the Kellogg company, I almost passed out into my cereal!",Happy
815,lol that would be amazing! Are you a Bill Nye fan?,Curious to dive deeper
815," I watched his show when I was younger, I haven't watched his new Netflix show however.",Neutral
815,I need to check out his new show. Apparently he got his start winning a steve martin look a like contest!,Curious to dive deeper
815," That's interesting, I don't see a lot of the resemblance between them.",Surprised
815," I don't either lol, maybe a very young Bill Nye. It was so nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
815," It was nice chatting with you as well, have a great day!",Happy
816,Have you ever seen the movie Justice League? Apparently it's arriving on Blu-ray in 4K resolution,Curious to dive deeper
816," That is a great movie, that would be awesome in that resolution. I like superman! what do you think?",Curious to dive deeper
816," I like the movie Superman, but I thought Justice League was quite horrible. I don't think that the movie being released in 4k is going to save it LOL",Neutral
816," that is true, some parts of the movie was good, but I think they could have had a better flash. Superman's rights were bought for 130 dollars in 1938. Good investment ",Curious to dive deeper
816," Yep I agree. It's too bad that the studio interfered so much with Justice League, it could have been a great movie but it wasn't",Sad
816," true, isn't there a new one coming out later? Superman had the power once to wield Thors hammer",Curious to dive deeper
816," Wow that's pretty cool I never knew that. And yes that movie was definitely full of problems, for instance they should have had darkseid be the big bad guy immediately at the start of the movie instead of at the end",Neutral
816,That is a good point. What else do you like for entertainment?,Curious to dive deeper
816," Well I used to play a lot of Nintendo games as a kid, I never realized that they had only the ability to display 54 colors at once",Surprised
816," I loved nintendo, the original only had 54 colors! consoles have come a long way!",Curious to dive deeper
816,I'm so happy that they were making Nintendo's until 2003! That's definitely my favorite system,Surprised
816," For sure, mario bros all day!  Those japanese make good systems!",Curious to dive deeper
816,I agree! It's much better than using chickens for entertainment like the Romans did in ancient Britain,Happy
816,For sure lol. Julius Caesar would have been more entertained lol,Curious to dive deeper
816," I have never seen a Ronald Reagan movie, but it's funny that one casting agent said that he didn't look presidential, how wrong he was lol",Surprised
816," I heard that, if only they could see the future lol. Boy they were wrong!",Curious to dive deeper
816," Who is your favorite superhero by the way? I really like Batman, and I think that Garfield as a superhero could be interesting LOL",Curious to dive deeper
816,I am a flash lover. So good of a show and awesome power!,Curious to dive deeper
816," I'll have to check it out, what I didn't know is that there are 300 superheroes that have been registered in the United States, I wonder what they all are and if some of them are better than the flash haha",Surprised
816," I didnt either, wow! Good chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
816," Thank you you too, apparently Stan lee wrote 15 DC Comics, I always thought he was a Marvel guy",Surprised
817," Hi! Have you seen Justice League yet? If you have and didn't like it, don't bother buying it on 4k. Otherwise it's just two hours of ""Oh what could have been "". DC and Warner Bros really missed a huge opportunity travel a mark on the world of superhero cinema!",Sad
817," I havent, but it seems like a great movie, DC and Warner Bros make a great combination, ",Curious to dive deeper
817,Are you a fan of superheroes? I am and wish I could follow all 300 registered superheroes in the US. Ha!,Neutral
817," I am a fan and didnt know there were so many heroes only on the US!! Thats a lot of them, do you have a favorite superheroe?",Curious to dive deeper
817," Honestly, I like them all but if I had to choose a favorite, I'd say Superman. Henry Cavill is my favorite Superman and I'm so thankful he didn't miss the call for the role due to playing World of Warcraft as he almost did. That would have been disappointing! What about you?",Happy
817," I like Superman as well, its a hard choice between him and Batman but the cryptonian wins the battle, he was created by Jerry Siegel, ",Curious to dive deeper
817,Indeed he was! And did you know DC bought the exclusive rights to Superman for a measly  $130 back in 1938? That is unbelievable!,Surprised
817," They sure made a great invesment, Superman must be one of the most expensive heors now, $138 sounds like a sweet deal",Curious to dive deeper
817,Agreed! Did you also know the writers didn't name Braniac after a preexisting word? They instead actually coined the term. That is pretty cool!,Neutral
817," It is pretty cool, Braniac is one of my favorite villains along with Lex Luthor, both pretty evil",Curious to dive deeper
817," True. I think it's cool Superman once wielded Thor's hammer because he was worthy. Indeed he is worthy, in my opinion!",Neutral
817," I think that as well, he is the most powerful hero out there and refuses to kill his enemies, he would be a hard to stop villain",Curious to dive deeper
817," He most certainly would! Since we're on the subject of Superman, did you know it's illegal to name your kid Superman along with Metallica, Elvis, Ikea and Veranda in Sweden? That is crazy - like would they really arrest you for something that silly?",Surprised
817," I didnt know that I wonder if many people wanted to name their kids after them, I guess those are popular names",Angry
817," I guess so! But you know, I'd like to read some of the Superman and Batman comics that Stan Lee wrote. They say he wrote 15 and even reimagined the characters!",Curious to dive deeper
817," Those titles must be really interesting, Stan Lee was a genius, Im sad he is no longer with us",Curious to dive deeper
817," I am as well. The comic genre will never be the same. He created so many characters I loved to read about, watch and even play on the Nintendo Entertainment System! Speaking of which, did you know it could only display 54 colors. Isn't that crazy?",Sad
817," That was a great system I really loved it, too bad the system got discontinued on 2003,",Curious to dive deeper
817,It's kind of surprising as I figured Japan had discontinued it long before 2003! Are you also a fan of Bill Nye? I can't believe he got his big break by winning a Steve Martin lookalike contest!,Surprised
817," Yeah I used to like his show Bill Nye the Science Guy, and thats funny, he does look like Steve Martin do you agree?",Happy
817," I think he does and that's a great way to get famous by looking like someone. But then again, Ronald Reagan lost out on a role because a movie executive didn't think he looked presidential. How ironic is that? Ha! Well, it was nice chatting with you today! Take care and have a great day, friend!",Neutral
817," That is ironic lol, he definetely showed them how mistaken they were, and you have a great day as well my friend. ",Curious to dive deeper
818,Do you like to read?  I enjoy Stephen King books.  My first question would be to definitely ask him what I should be reading.  He does admit that is the most frequent question he gets.,Happy
818," Hi, I love to read. There is so much to read. Did you know about a guy who while imprisoned spent most of the time in the library?",Happy
818," I remember hearing that before, very crazy!  I just learned that Stephen King was in a band with Matt Groening.  Makes me want to rewatch some Simpsons horror episodes!",Surprised
818," LoL cool, what a combination. Did you know the movie Bambi, terrified Stephen King?",Happy
818," I did not know that, but I think it scared me a bit too when I was that age.  Speaking of terrifying, Ronald McDonald being one of the inspirations for ""It"" is hysterical!",Surprised
818," Ronald Mc Donald is creepy, but It never stopped me for going to Mc Donalds.  Did you know there is more libraries than Mc Donalds in the US.",Happy
818," That is wild!  I need to publish a book in Norway, you are guaranteed to sell at least 1,000!",Surprised
818,Great incentive !! and they promise to take it to different libraries of the country.,Happy
818," That is great.  Speaking of books I am not sure I ever realized Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally from ""Parks and Recreation"" were actually in love until they released their recent book.",Surprised
818," Interesting question!! you know ? the book All you can ever know "" by Nicole Chung sounds captivating, she was adopted in Korea and raised in Oregon and is in search of her roots",Curious to dive deeper
818," Very interesting.  I am all on board with the ""library of things"" they have in Sacramento where you can rent out things that you need for a short period of timelike sewing machines.",Happy
818,That will save some space at home and make us avoid buying what we hardly ever need!  did you ever hear about William Gladstone?,Happy
818," I am not familiar with Gladstone, but recently learned his story of using his wheelbarrow to transport 32,000 books at age 85.  I would love to be in that kind of shape at 85!",Surprised
818," That is so cute. He was an UK prime Minister, but I think is great he did not say well I am too old to accomplish my goal!!!",Happy
818," Yup, sounds like quite the avid reader.  I find it great that when it comes to reading their are no concrete laws, but that each reader can interpret what they want how they want it.",Happy
818,Yes it is a complex process in the brain and unique on each of us. It promotes creativity.,Happy
818," Yes, funny to think it was only 300 or so years ago that a moral panic ensued over the spread of reading novels.",Fearful
818," Wow that is almost hard to believe, did you hear about ""you laugh, you loose "" competitions?",Happy
818,I did not know about that until recently either!  I would have never guessed Tolkien had a sense of humor!,Surprised
818," I would have lost,  but they did it while reading terrible poetry.. that has to be hillarious",Happy
818,Poetry has to be the deepest exploration of texts in terms of interpretation.  Fifteen people can read the same short poem and interpret it all different ways.,Curious to dive deeper
818,very subjective. Well great chat. Have a good day,Happy
819,Do you like to read?,Curious to dive deeper
819," I like to red my son bedtime stories, thats about as far as it goes.",Happy
819," I have some recomendations for you, in case you decie to pcik a book, one of them Elevation, thats a great book",Curious to dive deeper
819,Oh yeah. Whats it about.,Happy
819,Its a book by Stephen King its about a man who faces challenges and tries to find common fround,Curious to dive deeper
819,Cool. I might check it out.,Happy
819," You should, also a book called All You Can Ever Know: A memoir, that is also a great book",Curious to dive deeper
819,Is that by stephen king as well.,Happy
819," No, thats a book by Nicole Chung you can buy it for about $26",Curious to dive deeper
819,I doubt I will end up buying it. I may go see if the library has it.,Happy
819," You can also search for The Flame: Poems Notebooks, thats another recommended book",Curious to dive deeper
819,I hear starship troopers  is endorsed by muh of the military.,Happy
819," The book is highly recommended by the millitary, ",Curious to dive deeper
819,Have you read it.,Happy
819," No I havent red that one, Enders Game is another great book, I liked the movie and I did read that one",Curious to dive deeper
819,That one is also suggested material by the military.,Happy
819," Yeah its also on the list, did you hear about Anne Jones and her record?",Curious to dive deeper
819,Yes for speed reading. 4700 words per minute. Wow.,Happy
819," That is amazing, top speed, I wonder if she comprehends the books she reads ",Curious to dive deeper
819,I would say they tested her in some way.,Happy
819," That must be difficult to meassure, she must be really smart.",Curious to dive deeper
820,Hi!  Do you like to use the library?,Curious to dive deeper
820," Hi there! I'm a big time reader, but I'm not so much a library guy anymore. How about yourself?",Curious to dive deeper
820,I used to use the library a lot more before the internet came along.  Now I still use to get books.,Happy
820,Do you have a favorite author?,Curious to dive deeper
820,Not really but I do like Stephen King!,Happy
820,So many of his books have been made it movies it's incredible. I don't think I've actually read any of his books though.,Neutral
820," I read some of them when I was younger.  Now I mainly read autobiographies, history, business, investiong, and sports books.  lol  Almost all of his books are connected.",Happy
820," I just read Killers of the Flower Moon by David Grann, I highly recommend it.",Happy
820,I'll have to check it out.  I'm not familiar with him.  Stephen King's books have sold more than 350 million copies.  Whoa.  I didn't know he sold that many!,Happy
820,Yeah he think he's one of the best selling authors of all time. I must have made some serious money. I wonder what his net worth is.,Curious to dive deeper
820,Has to be millions for sure!  lol  He played in a band with Matt Groening.  Who is that?,Curious to dive deeper
820,Isn't that the guy who created the Simpsons? That's so crazy that those two guys are friends.,Curious to dive deeper
820,I didn't know that.  That is crazy then! lol,Happy
820,Have you read any of the Game of Thrones books?,Curious to dive deeper
820,I haven't is it better than the show?,Happy
820,The earlier books most definitely were. The latest ones the author kind of stretched his world too far. It's probably why he's having a tough time finishing the story.,Neutral
820,I'll have to put that on my reading list.  I tend to read more during the winter months.  Did you know that Starship Troopers is on the reading lists of 3 of the 5 military branches?,Happy
820,I wonder why that's on the reading list. I heard Ender's game is a popular read list item for the military as well.,Neutral
820,I saw that.  Do you know who Anne Jones is?,Curious to dive deeper
820," Sounds familiar, does she hold a record of some sort?",Curious to dive deeper
820," Yes.  She holds the world record for speed reading with 4,700 words per minute.  I wonder if she was able to comprehend what she was reading.",Happy
820," Yes, how do you think they test that? She must able to relay the information back or something right?",Curious to dive deeper
820,I would guess so. lol  It's been fun chatting!  Have a good one!,Happy
821,What a tragedy that someone was murdered over a pair of shoes!,Sad
821,I cannot believe that regular people spend a lot of money on shoes.,Sad
821," Me either!  I understand that it's a status symbol, but that's ridiculous",Surprised
821,I sympathized with Ms. Smith,Disgusted
821," I don't know about that, I do sympathize too but I don't think his mother is at fault",Sad
821,She was not at fault.  In general I would not want to buy my kids fancy shoes or cars that would attract attention from bad people.,Curious to dive deeper
821," That's true, especially in a high-crime area like D.C. ",Neutral
821,That was what I meant earlier.,Curious to dive deeper
821,I understand!  It's strange how footwear is considered a cultural phenomenon these days,Neutral
821," It has to do with marketing by shoe manufacturers, such as Nike.",Surprised
821," That's true, and with endorsements from professional athletes it makes them an aspirational product ",Neutral
821,Michael Jordan often represents Nike. Kids love him.,Curious to dive deeper
821,Yeah!  (Loved him in Space Jam)  I always thought it was neat that they used him as the Air Jordan logo,Neutral
821,I admire him too.,Happy
821,Did you know that wasn't even how he jumped when he played basketball?  He was doing a ballet jump!,Happy
821,I did not know that.  Thank you for informing me since he is one of my favorite athletes.,Happy
821,It's fascinating how specialized our footwear is to be tailored to different sports.  Like cleats!  Who would have thought?,Happy
821,True.  You seem knowledgeable about shoes.,Happy
821," A little bit!  I've worn many throughout my lifetime.  I even used to do ballet, did you know that professional ballet dancers go through a new shoe every performance?",Curious to dive deeper
821,What else can you tell me about Michael Jordan?,Happy
821,He made more money from his Air Jordan royalties than he ever did in his entire NBA career!,Curious to dive deeper
821," I did not know that.  Going back to your previous question, I did not know about ballet dancers and new shoes for his or her every performance.",Surprised
821," That's for pointe shoes, at least",Neutral
821,I read that Marbury promoted inexpensive ballet shoes.,Curious to dive deeper
821,Yes!  And wasn't even paid to endorse them,Neutral
822,Sup? I just read a single google search requires more computing power than the moon landing,Surprised
822,I thought the Google stuff was interesting. I'd like to see some reforms to reduce its monopoly power.,Neutral
822," Yea, they have too much access to data. Google maps calculates traffic by tracking android devices",Neutral
822," Re the moon shot and computing power, I remember reading that the only way they could find parts to keep the space shuttle running was to search through abandoned hospitals and electronic junkyards for early 80s generation computer hardware.",Neutral
822,That's crazy. Did you know the UN has an ambassador to extraterrestrials?,Curious to dive deeper
822,I just saw that! I had no idea. But I guess it couldn't hurt to be prepared.,Neutral
822,It's possible they visited earth earlier. Humans have only been on earth for the equivalent of 1 minute and 17 seconds of earth's entire history,Neutral
822,True. Personally I doubt it -- I suspect intelligent civilizations are so far apart that contact is pretty rare. But I really hope something like a faster-than-light drive is possible so we an meet each other.,Neutral
822,That would be cool. Hopefully we find new planets soon 80 percent of earths forrest have been destroyed,Fearful
822,Absolutely. I hope exploring the solar system and settling other planets is cheap enough to be feasible soon.,Neutral
822," Yea, earth has a lot of issue, it will be virtually helium-free by the end of the century",Sad
822," I wonder why just now, as long as it's been in the atmosphere.",Neutral
822," Maybe it's man made or just natural. When earth was first formed a day was 5.5 hours long, maybe that contributed to it some way",Curious to dive deeper
822,I think the earth slowed down because of the moon's gravitational pull. I guess that means the days will keep getting longer.,Neutral
822," yea, when earth formed 4.5 billion years ago and didn't have a moon at first",Curious to dive deeper
822,IIRC the moon supposedly resulted from a large body passing close enough to pull a big chunk of material out of the earth.,Neutral
822,Yea and now the moon effects ocean tides and stabilizes the Earth's rotation,Curious to dive deeper
822," Yeah, it's cool to think of those enormous masses of water being pulled back and forth by the moon's gravity.",Neutral
822," Yea, 71% of the earth is water so it has a huge impact on Earth",Curious to dive deeper
822,Just imagine if it was closer! I think it could get within about 20000 miles before gravitational forces were enough to pull it apart.,Neutral
822,I wonder what effects it has on Earth's polar regions covered in ice,Curious to dive deeper
823,lion king was the first disney film to be dubbed in zulu,Surprised
823,The Lion King was a movie about Africa! That's great that they put it in an African language.,Neutral
823,yes it was for its african release. so smart of them,Neutral
823," Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman. I wonder how many languages it was dubbed into. Probably not Zulu, but you never know.",Neutral
823,how do you even direct an animated movie? Its not like you need to tell the actors what to do. lol,Neutral
823," I guess they get performances out of the voice actors, change the lines, stuff like that.",Neutral
823,makes sense. I never realized that there was a walt disney pictures that is a subsidiary of walt disney studio which is owned by the walt disney company. man how do they keep all of that straight,Happy
823," I guess for legal reasons they want the name DIsney on everything. There are the theme parks, the movies, the merchandise. It's a huge company. The toy industry gets involved in Disney animations even before the beginning of the film production.",Neutral
823,wow wreck it ralph started in the late 80' s,Surprised
823,I guess the technology wasn't read yet for that animated feature. Did you ever play Nintendo?,Curious to dive deeper
823,yes we still do.,Neutral
823," Did you play the NES, the original system? It had only 54 colors.",Neutral
823,and it wasnt discontinued in japan until 2003!,Surprised
823,I guess fans were still playing the thing. I wonder who was developing games at that point though. Do you think Reagan looks presidential?,Neutral
823,i guess people thought that way because he was a movie star before he was president. i mean schwarzenegger doesn't look very governerish,Neutral
823,That's true. Perhaps even Bill Nye could end up looking presidential.,Neutral
823,maybe not presidential but definitely steve martin,Surprised
823," With the right makeup, make Bill Nye could look presidential. ",Neutral
823," did you know elsa was supposed to be the villain but ""let it go"" was so uplifting that they changed the whole movie",Happy
823," I never saw that film. It sounds like it's another Disney winner. Great story, great animation, great songs.",Neutral
823,yes it was,Neutral
823," It's funny that Disney renamed ""Rapunzel"" to ""Tangled"" and ""Snow Queen"" to ""Frozen"" because they blamed feminine titles for underperforming box offices. Maybe it's the title. I wonder how many boys watch those films.",Neutral
823,they do good with having strong male characters that boys can enjoy,Neutral
824,I would think its hard to learn soccer on a desert field,Curious to dive deeper
824,You know I think that would be pretty difficult too! Good thing they were able to go to Maryland and advance their skills. Are there any resources in your community for refugee children?,Curious to dive deeper
824,Not that I am aware of; I don't think we have any refugees,Neutral
824,Interesting. Well that's good that there are places around the world that do offer those supports.,Curious to dive deeper
824,The LACES program was a great idea; its suprising that Liberia has been at war about as long as we have,Surprised
824,I also think it was a very good idea! Something else really cool about the article is what it said about Youtube! I can't believe Justin Bieber's song is considered the most disliked! haha.,Curious to dive deeper
824,Definitely gets my vote for worst...lol,Neutral
824,There are children who are becoming millionaires just because they open up their presents on video and kids want to watch them. At the very least Justin Bieber performed a skill haha.,Curious to dive deeper
824,I must have watched gangnam style a million times myself,Happy
824,I don't think i've ever watched a child open a gift on youtube lol. It was also shocking knowing that kids were wanting to watch others play pokemon.,Curious to dive deeper
824,Do you watch the ones where they eat tons of food?,Neutral
824," I can not say that I do, but I have heard that there are people who eat specific food items that I guess sound 'refreshing'. For example, there was an African American woman who would eat her dill pickle into a microphone. ",Curious to dive deeper
824,Have you watched the bluetbe channel?,Curious to dive deeper
824," I have not, have you?",Curious to dive deeper
824,I subscribe to the channel and watch videos they post every few days,Neutral
824,What kinds of videos do they post? I imagine it being like COPS and they just show them chasing after criminals.,Curious to dive deeper
824,Training and lessons learned vids,Neutral
824,Very interesting. I think it's kind of unfortunate how police officers have been depicted so negatively due to the couple of bad apples.,Curious to dive deeper
824,Youtube trails only Google for largest search engine,Neutral
824,I'm surprised Youtube is still even popular due to the rise of social media and the many platforms that allow people to view videos.,Curious to dive deeper
824,Happy Holidays to you!,Neutral
825,Have you used spotify?,Neutral
825," I tried it out once, but didn't stick with it. I liked that it's basic features were free. I couldn't find songs I liked though",Sad
825,Yeah there is  a lot of songs on the service. Did you know that is has over 4 million songs that haven't even been played once? That's apparently 20 percent of their songs!,Curious to dive deeper
825," That is crazy! 4 million unplayed! With so many millions, I should give it a try again. Maybe I should try the paid subscription, with improved streaming quality?",Surprised
825," It might help, but with so many unplayed songs it may be an indicator there's too many. After all, it takes 130,745 plays per day for a musician to earn minimum wage on the site.",Neutral
825,That's a shame for the musicians. I 'm surprised Google hasn't come up with competitor yet. Did you realize Google is over 20 years old now. It was founded in 1998!,Surprised
825," Actually I did know of that, but did you know that google's map changes depending on the country you live in due to boarder disputes?",Curious to dive deeper
825," Interesting. Probably saves them from getting hate mail! Hard to believe it started with just two guys, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. They only own 14% of the shares now, though. ",Neutral
825," Yeah, but I'm sure that's quite substantial considering how big they are. They went down once in 2013 and decrease all web traffic by 40 percent!",Happy
825," That's nice. It's nice, too, that they at least pretend to care about the earth. They once used live goats to mow the lawns around the headquarters. ",Neutral
825," That's definitely a good thing, considering 80 percent of earth's natural forest's have been eradicated.",Sad
825,I wonder how that looks on Google maps! Only 29% of the earth is even land.  The other 71% is water.,Surprised
825," Ah yes that is true isn't it? Well I must go now, good talking to you.",Neutral
825," This conversation was so short! Reminds me of how if the earth's history was a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds!",Neutral
825," Oh wow, that puts things into perspective.",Neutral
825," Such a short period, and so much has changed on earth in that time. Days used to be only 5.5 hours long when earth was first formed.",Neutral
825,Crazy to think we went from that to now facing the complete elimination of helium in our atmosphere,Curious to dive deeper
825,I hope when extraterrestrials come they don't need the helium! Maybe we should talk to the United Nations' Ambassador to extraterrestrials. Can you believe that's a real job?!,Surprised
825," I had no idea, how strange!",Neutral
825," It sure is! I guess maybe they'll show up some time, even though earth is the only astronomical object known to harbor life. ",Surprised
825," Ah yes, but who knows considering the vastness of space? Had an interesting conversation, good day.",Neutral
826," Hi, do you watch association football?",Curious to dive deeper
826," I do not watch association football, and until reading this article did not know that this was an alternate term for what we call ""soccer"".  ",Curious to dive deeper
826,I've been wanting to watch it. Soccer makes more money than most sports combined worldwide.,Surprised
826," That is also surprising to hear, but when you think about it so many countries participate and it's a global sport.  I also didn't know that there was a variation that involved 3 teams at a time-were you aware of that?",Surprised
826,I think so too. Jon Stewart was a very skilled soccer player and represented the US in 1983.,Surprised
826," If it's the Jon Stewart that I am thinking of, he's a funny guy.  I have never heard of the German soccer player Mesut Ozil, but am now aware that he donated his bonus winnings from the world cup to pay for surgeries for children.",Curious to dive deeper
826,That's awesome and good for him for doing that. We need more people like that in this world.,Happy
826," Similar to Seren Fryatt who started LACES after seeing the joy it brought to Liberian women, it's an example of one person reaching out to others",Curious to dive deeper
826,Very cool. Did you know there is a variation of soccer in which 3 teams play at the same time?,Surprised
826," I was not aware of that, I wonder how a winner is determined?",Curious to dive deeper
826,Not too sure on that one. American's call it soccer because that is slang for association football.,Surprised
826," Yeah, that's what I call it.  I only played in elementary school.  Have you ever played soccer?",Curious to dive deeper
826,I also played in elementary school. My son plays now.,Neutral
826," My children do not play soccer, but my son wrestles and my daughter has played baseball.  It's a good way to come together with other kids, like the like at the Total Soccer Area in Maryland-they would have loved to meet other kids like that. ",Happy
826,Do you watch the Academy Awards?,Curious to dive deeper
826," I do not, but am aware that they give out the Oscars.  Do you really think that Eminem has more oscars than Leonardo DiCaprio, Will Smith, George Lucas,  and Bill Murray?  I find that hard to believe.",Surprised
826,I find that very hard to believe. Daniel Day-Lewis is the only actor to win best actor at the Oscars 3 different times.,Surprised
826,And how do the Oscars win Emmy's I wonder?  They were nominated for 9 in 2013.  For the production of their show?,Surprised
826,I have no idea how that works. Blazing Saddles was nominated for 3 Oscars.,Surprised
826," I am not surprised at that, or at the fact that Walt Disney has 22 oscars.",Happy
826," Wow that' a lot! Well, it was great talking with you. Take care!",Happy
827," Hi. Do you enjoy movie trivia? I am a big fan of Disney movies which is one of the ""Big Six"" film studios in Hollywood.",Curious to dive deeper
827," Yes I enjoy movies trivia, I always watch Disney movies especially cartoons.",Happy
827," I really like them, even though in the 70's Disney recycled a lot of their animation frames creating identical scenes.",Happy
827," I didn't know that, Yes I would think so, in the 70's the graphics and colors weren't as good as they are now.",Curious to dive deeper
827,I know they are so crisp and advanced today. Frozen was the first film to be directed by a woman.,Happy
827," I don't remember seen frozen, but I am pretty sure it was good, have you seen it?",Curious to dive deeper
827,I have. It was inspired by Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale the Snow Queen. Its about a princess who goes to save her sister who's icy powers have trapped their kingdom in eternal winter.,Neutral
827," Oh I think that I have seen it, did the wicked queen became frozen at the end? I always like snow white, the movie.",Curious to dive deeper
827," It definitely has some frozen characters but like all disney movies they have a happy ending. They name them ""Frozen"" and ""Tangled"" because female names like Rapunzel, Snow Queen or Snow White even had started to underperform at the box office.",Neutral
827," OK, have you seen the Pirates of the Caribbean which made over $1 billion in the worldwide box office?",Curious to dive deeper
827,I have! It was a great movie with great toys. Did you know that the toy industry is involved before the filming has begun?,Surprised
827," No I didn't know that, what about the Lion King, would you believe one of the best part I like about the Lion king was the song by Elton John.",Curious to dive deeper
827,Its a great song! The Lion King was the first film to be dubbed into Zulu for its African release. I think that's nice.,Happy
827," Yes, It was nice, do you get into much entertainments, such as music, dancing and video games?",Curious to dive deeper
827,I have played Nintendo. I had the original which only displayed in 54 colors!,Happy
827," I used to like Pac-Man, would you believe when caesar visit britain, people used chicken not for breeding, but for entertainments.",Curious to dive deeper
827," How funny. I suppose things were a bit boring before they had something as fun as a Nintendo, even though it was discontinued in September 2003.",Neutral
827," Yes that true, Bill nye, science guy, got a break in entertainment by winning the steve martin look alike contest.",Curious to dive deeper
827,Well this has been a lot of fun. Thanks for chatting and learning new and interesting things with me.,Happy
827," Ronald Reagan was rejected from a movie for looking like the president, It was nice chatting with you also",Surprised
827,Keep learning new things!,Happy
828,Some people feel the holiday season begins right after Halloween.  Some though say December 1.  When do you think?,Curious to dive deeper
828,i am from the school of thought that it begins around thanksgiving. what about you?,Neutral
828," Yes, that is about right.  Put the lights up then and start hearing the music.  ",Curious to dive deeper
828,do you think mariah carey's song is a good measure of when the season begins?,Neutral
828,Well it seems that more people need Mariah in their lives than usual around the holidays.,Curious to dive deeper
828," haha that's true! have you seen the movie mentioned in the article, Love Actually?",Neutral
828,I don't remember that one. What was that one about?,Surprised
828," it is a movie that takes place in the UK and follows a couple different storylines. i love it! actually, i missed watching it this year sadly",Neutral
828," Is it a holiday movie?  Did you know that on Spotify a musician needs to get a little over 130,000 plays to make minimum wage?  That's a hard business.",Surprised
828,it is a holiday movie! and is that total plays or does it have to be plays from different users i wonder?,Curious to dive deeper
828," I don't know.  But there was a band that earned $20,000 from Spotify for a silent album and used the money to finance a free tour.  Interesting, huh?",Surprised
828,what is a silent album?,Curious to dive deeper
828,I was wondering that too.  Did you know that 80% of the earth's natural forests have been destroyed already.  Sad.,Surprised
828,that is sad! what do you think it would be like to have a day that is only 5.5 hours long?,Neutral
828,Depends if I were sleeping or playing.  Earth will be virtually helium free at the end of the 21st century,Surprised
828," yes, so what exactly does that mean?",Curious to dive deeper
828,I guess no party balloons.,Sad
828," yes i guess so! that will be a bummer, i wonder what else will change on this earth",Neutral
828,Well in any case we'll apparently have ambassadors from the United Nations if extraterrestrials arrive,Surprised
828," yes I saw that, I don't think I believe in aliens though. what about you?",Neutral
828," Don't think so, but who knows what's out there for sure.  Nice talking to you.",Surprised
829," Hi! So, I was not aware that the movie ""Frozen"" was the first Disney film to have a female director! That is actually pretty cool info. I have never watched it, myself, but now I might have to get around to doing that. :-)",Curious to dive deeper
829," That was news to me too! I was also shocked to hear that they renamed Frozen and Tangled to avoid ""feminine"" titles. How stupid is that?",Surprised
829," Ha. Yeah. That is absolutely ridiculous. And what exactly constitutes a ""feminine"" title? I mean... Sleeping Beauty? Pocahontas? And then even things like ""Snow White"" and ""Cinderella"". Everyone knows those are FEMALE characters, so yeah. I don't get that at all. ",Surprised
829,I wasn't surprised that Disney recycled a lot of their animation in the 70s. I noticed that even as a child.,Neutral
829," I never really noticed that myself, but now it is suuuuuuuper obvious. Instead of making new films, they are putting all of their energy into live action remakes of the classics. I know they are making a new Dumbo, a new Lion King, and a new Aladdin, right? I'm sure there are more.",Curious to dive deeper
829," Yes, that's what I've heard too. I'm not sure I really think they should be remaking classics, but maybe that's just me. I was surprised Wreck-it Ralph was in production in the 80's!  That movie took forever to release in that case!",Surprised
829," YES! That was crazy!!! I mean, I enjoyed that movie. (I have a son, so we watch more of the rough and tumble shows than we do the princess films.) I liked it, and he loved it, but I certainly didn't see anything in it that should have taken 30 some odd years to make. haha. I haven't seen the second one yet, but I'm anxious, too. Considering the first one took 3 decades, I'm surprised they put out a sequel so soon.",Surprised
829," I guess they must have changed the plot a bunch or had to go back to the drawing board, so to speak, when the technology advanced...repeatedly. Ha. I guess they have it down now to release a sequel so quickly. but wow..3 decades. I can't even imagine.",Curious to dive deeper
829," Yeah. That blows my mind, too. I mean, some of the best movies I've ever seen didn't even take that long. I don't know. I'm a huge Game of Thrones fan, and as quickly as they turn that stuff out - and keep the quality amazingly good .... well, it is just hard for me to imagine a cartoon taking so long. I didn't realize that the guy that voiced King Candy in that one also voices so many different Disney characters. The only think I really knew him from was that series with Eliza Dushku, ""Dollhouse."" I had no idea he voiced characters, too.",Neutral
829,That was a surprise to me as well. Did you see that Bill Nye got his break in a Steve Martin lookalike contest? How cool is that?,Surprised
829," Ha. Yeah. He looks NOTHING like Steve Martin to me. As a sidenote, I can't EVER say Bill Nye's name without doing the little ""Bill Nye the sci-ENCE guy"" chant afterwards.) haha. And I hate when people talk about him without context because I always want to confuse him with Bill Nighy, which is pronounced exactly the same way), but they are two totally different people.",Neutral
829," Yes, I always have to say ""the science guy"" too! Have you seen his show on Netflix, ""Bill Nye Saves the World""?",Curious to dive deeper
829," I have not! I'm not even sure I've heard of it, which is crazy because I watch Netflix WAY more than any normal person should. Haha. Is it like an older version of the kid's show? Or is it something totally different?",Curious to dive deeper
829," No, the audience for his new show is really for adults that watched his original show as children. ",Neutral
829," That is kind of what I meant. Sorry. I didn't word my question well. Haha. But still, that sounds super cool. I might have to check it out. I have been watching ""The Umbrella Academy"" the last few days. My son and I are about 5 episodes in so far. We LOVE it. I guess Netflix is having to find some alternative superhero shows to cater to the superhero-loving crowd now that Disney is pulling all of their Marvel stuff off Netflix for their own streaming service. ",Happy
829," Is the Umbrella Academy mostly for kids? I don't have any children, and while I do like Disney, my tastes in TV usually lean more towards sci-fi/fantasy.",Curious to dive deeper
829," Not at all! In fact, the language is a little rougher than I like my kid hearing, but he is 13, and I am sure he hears worse at school. No, it is more of... well... I'd say it has a bit of an x-men vibe to it, but it is quite a bit darker than X-men. But the basic idea is the same - 7 individuals born with extraordinary abilities are taken in by a rich, eccentric man who trains them to fight evil. But if you like sci-fi, you'd probably enjoy it. It has a lot of time travel elements to it, too. VERY interesting show.",Happy
829,Cool!  I'll have to add it to my watch list then. Thanks for the tip! Did you see the part of the article where it says the original Nintendo could only display 54 colors? It sure seemed like it was a lot more at the time!,Curious to dive deeper
829," I DID know that. I'm a huge video game nerd, so I love game trivia. Haha. Of all the things that have improved with time, video games are one of the things that amaze me most. We went from Pitfall on the Atari - a little BADLY DRAWN man running constantly to the right with an occasional jump thrown in - to games like Skyrim and World of Warcraft. It amazes me that it started out so humbly. ",Happy
829," Cool! Yes, and then think, even before Pitfall, we had Pong! We've come a very long way in what seems such a short period of time, but well, it's been over 40 years since Pong came out.",Neutral
829," You're right. You're absolutely right. I had forgotten about Pong. haha. Still. The advancements there amaze me! Well, I have to say, I have really enjoyed talking to you today. :-) I'm going to run out and grab some lunch before I have to go tutor some high school kids for after school tutoring. :-) I hope you have an amazing rest of your day and a great week!",Happy
829,I had a great time talking to you as well. I hope you have a great rest of your day and week as well.,Happy
829,Thanks! See ya!,Happy
830,Do you have a favorite album?,Curious to dive deeper
830,Hmmm....good question.  That's tough.  I would have to say it would be the first album I ever got when I was a kid...simply because it was my first one.  It was a Partridge Family Christmas album.  lol  Do you know what the best selling album of the 21st century is?,Happy
830," My favorite, it was hybrid theory by linkin park!",Curious to dive deeper
830,Nice!  I remember when that one came out.  Do you remember the band Reel Big Fish?  They re-recorded all of their hits for a best of album after losing the rights to their songs to their old record label.,Happy
830," That is  funny, they sound  family, what are their hit songs?",Curious to dive deeper
830,Do you remember the song Three Strange Days?  It was popular around the mid 90s or so.  That was their biggest hit.,Happy
830," for sure, now i do! Were you a star wars fan?",Curious to dive deeper
830,I was a huge Star Wars fan because the first movie came out when I was 7.  Still have followed it and love it to this day. I had all the toys when I was little.,Happy
830,So good of movies! Apparently george lucas became a billionaire because of those toys!,Curious to dive deeper
830,I believe it.  They got some good cash out of my family. lol  In 2018 the entire franchise was estimated to be valued at $65 billion dollars!,Happy
830,Then they sold out and sold to Disney. Disney was smart for doing that. I think George Lucas' wife had a part in some of the films,Curious to dive deeper
830,Yes. She won an academy award for editing the film!  Guess she was in the right place at the right time and didn't hurt she was married to George. lol,Happy
830,Wow that is awesome! Famous couple right there. they even dubbed a star wars movie in navajo,Curious to dive deeper
830,Interesting!  There must be a lot of Navajo speakers out there to make it worthwhile.,Happy
830," for sure, I wonder how many or why they thought of that",Curious to dive deeper
830," Not sure.  James Earl Jones recorded Darth Vader's lines for the original movie in only 2.5 hours and was paid $7,500.  Not too bad and I'm sure he made a ton of money after that.",Happy
830," I wish I got paid that, I wouldn't complain once lol! I wouldve asked for a pay raise for the next ones though",Curious to dive deeper
830,Me too!  I hear you on that!  lol  Jumping back to the albums....I find it amazing that Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon was still one of the best selling albums of 2014...more than 40 years after it was first released!,Happy
830," For sure, good chatting with you friend!",Curious to dive deeper
830,It was a pleasure!  One more quick question....Do you know a hit song by Drake I should check out?,Curious to dive deeper
830,Bye!,Curious to dive deeper
831,Hey there what do you think about Disney movies? I really love the Lion King myself,Curious to dive deeper
831," Hi, I love Disney too! I've watched just about every movie that they've made. Did you know they're making the Lion King into a live action film this year?",Curious to dive deeper
831," yes I did! are you going to see it btw? i didn't really like the remake of beauty and the best, so I will probably stear clear myself",Curious to dive deeper
831," Yes, I'm very interested in watching it. I've heard good things about it, but anyways did you know that the Lion King was the first disney film to be dubbed into zulu for its african release?",Curious to dive deeper
831," no I didn't thats interesting though! have you seen the movie Frozen by the way? Apparently that was the first Disney movie to be directed by a woman, I know that it made a lot of money so it must have been successful",Surprised
831," Yes, I've seen Frozen before. It's so funny because it was called ""snow queen"" first, but Disney renamed it to ""Frozen"" because they blamed feminine titles for underperforming box offices.",Happy
831," haha that is interesting I didn't know that, and yes Jennifer lee directed it, and it made more than 1 billion dollars, thats insane and great for her I'm sure",Surprised
831," Yes, it's also cool because Elsa was supposed to be the main villain in frozen, but they wrote the song ""Let It Go"" for her, and since the song was so uplifting they decided to change her character instead of the song.",Happy
831," wow that is interesting, funny with that song too, the co-author of it did some songs 4 South Park and also for the Book of Mormon, those are both pretty raunchy, pretty funny that he also did songs for Frozen LOL",Surprised
831," Yes, it's quite funny, and the co-author Robert Lopez is quite talented as well because he is one of 12 people that have ever won EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, & Tony), so he must be multi-talented.",Happy
831," Yep it sounds like he is very talented. Back to Disney movies though, apparently the toy manufacturers talk to Disney before Disney even starts making the movies. I don't know how I feel about that, kind of scummy",Surprised
831," Well, I don't know about that. It sounds like good business sense to me, because they basically figure out how to market the main characters of the film before the film actually gets released. It's kind of funny though, because during the 70s disney recycled a lot of their animation frames, resulting in identical scenes in some movies.",Happy
831,Yeah I did know about that. I think one of the movies where they did that was the animated Robin Hood movie. That's a cost-saving measure for sure. Have you seen the movie Wreck-It Ralph?,Curious to dive deeper
831," Yes, I have! I rented the DVD. I find it funny that it took such a long time in production because the development actually started in the late 1980's, but it wasn't released until 2012.",Surprised
831,Yep I agree with you! I did like all of the 80s Video Game references in that movie. What else do you do for entertainment? I remember I used to play the regular Nintendo back in the day,Curious to dive deeper
831," I'm not much for video games (even though I do play with friends on ocassion), but I did find it interesting that the ninetendo entertainment system could display only 54 colors.",Curious to dive deeper
831," Yep that never seem to bother me, I never noticed it as a kid haha. I'm just glad that the system was as good as it was. And I'm shocked that it lasted until the year 2003 in Japan",Surprised
831," Yeah, me too, but anyways did you know that Ronald Reagan was once rejected for a movie role because an entertainment executive didn't think he had ""that presidential look""? Ironic, huh?",Curious to dive deeper
831," Didn't know that! That's pretty crazy. I also would have never guessed that Bill Nye the Science Guy did Steve Martin look alike contests, although I can kind of see that one at least",Surprised
831," Yeah, that's pretty cool. I also find it interesting that Alan tudyk has had a role in every disney animated film since ""wreck-it ralph"". He appeared in both ""Frozen"" and ""Zootopia"".",Neutral
831," Wow that is interesting. That guy is a good actor though. You like Roman history at all? Apparently Caesar made a note, that people in Great Britain would breed chickens to entertain themselves and not for eating LOL",Surprised
832,Hello - Do you like Drake the musician?,Curious to dive deeper
832,Hello. Not really to be honest.,Happy
832,Did you know he graduated high school at the age of 25?,Surprised
832,I didnt. I know he visited drake university in the middle of the night.,Happy
832,That's pretty cool. I saw he spent a ton of money on children's books during a tour in the UK.,Surprised
832,He seems like a pretty good guy. Did you know he was on the show degrassi,Happy
832,I did not know that either. The beat of one of his songs is sampled from Timmy Thomas' 1972 hit Why Can't We Live Together.,Surprised
832,Yeah. He played a boy who was paraplegic and pursues a music career on the show.,Happy
832,That's pretty cool of him to do that. Do you like Linkin Park?,Curious to dive deeper
832,Yeah they are ok. I guess.,Happy
832,Their album Hybrid Theory is the best selling album of the 21st century.,Surprised
832,Cool did you know aerosmith made more from guitar hero than any album.,Happy
832,I did not know that. Pretty crazy though. Two identical twins in Japan released a rap album when they turn 100 years old,Surprised
832,Wonder how many albums they sold. Enough to retire I hope.,Happy
832,I would hope so lol. The Dark Side of the Moon is still one of the best selling albums of 2014.,Surprised
832,It is a good album. Classics for all time.,Happy
832,I agree. I love Pink Floyd.,Happy
832,do you know bob marley is still on the charts.,Happy
832," I did not know that, but I love some Bob Marley. Makes me happy and want to sit on the beach and drink a beer.",Happy
832,Yeah he had some good ones thats for sure. It always makes me think of that will smith movie,Happy
832,It was good chatting with you!,Happy
833," How's it going, do you like Star Wars? George Lucas did a great job creating it",Curious to dive deeper
833,I love star wars. Do you like it?,Happy
833," Yea, my favorite is the original 1977 movie. You?",Curious to dive deeper
833,I love that movie! Do you have a favorite character?,Happy
833,Probably Hans Solo although I didn't like the 2018 movie with him,Neutral
833,I loved Han. He was so well written! I didn't like Solo but I did like the character. Did you see last jsdi?,Curious to dive deeper
833," No I haven't seen it yet, I wasn't to interest since I saw the Force Awakens in 2015",Neutral
833,The first 8 films were nominated for academy awards and were commercially successful with a combined box office revenue of $8.5B!,Happy
833," That is impressive, the entire franchise was valued at 65 billion!",Surprised
833,It is the second highest grossing film series of all time!,Happy
833," Yea, it's a good thing Marcia Lucas had a lot of input on the original trilogy or it wouldn't be worth as much",Neutral
833,Right? She was so instrumental in its development. Did you see what she contributed?,Happy
833," Yea, Marcia had the ideas with Leia kiss and Obi Wan's death",Neutral
833,That's crazy to me. that and James Earl Jones only go tpaid $7500 for 2.5 hours of work!,Surprised
833,That's pretty good but nowhere close to the billions Lucas made from Star Wars' merchandising rights,Neutral
833,Right? I thought that was really low but people said it was scale.,Curious to dive deeper
833," Yep, fox really screwed up that decision, they only saved 500k",Neutral
833,It did make george lucas a billionare though so he can't be too mad.,Surprised
833," Yea, speaking of billionaires did you know that Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon was still a best selling album in 2014?",Curious to dive deeper
833,Wow! I had no idea. It was great chatting with you!,Happy
834," So, when do you think Christmas begins?",Curious to dive deeper
834,I think the season starts the day after Halloween,Happy
834," Wow, that's early.  But it's in line with what Google's research shows",Surprised
834," Its not the official start, but they do seem to skip right over Thanksgiving",Curious to dive deeper
834," It's an interesting concept, to track a Holiday songs Google searches to monitor how people think.  Probably truer than what people would actually say.",Curious to dive deeper
834,Leave it to google,Neutral
834,Google probably knows more about us than we do about ourselves.  It's a little scary.,Fearful
834,Yes. they are great at tracking Data,Curious to dive deeper
834," These algorithms are never as good as they say they are.  I use Spotify and it tries to make recommendations for me based on what I listen to, it's never very good.",Sad
834,Yes. But they will get better in the future,Curious to dive deeper
834," You're probably right.  What I really like is the Google Earth tool, I love those map and being able to focus down on a street.  It's amazing that they have mapped the whole world like that.",Curious to dive deeper
834,Yes. I have used that in the past myself. It works well.,Happy
834,Even that's a little creepy.  Being able to look down on your neighbors back yard and such.,Fearful
834,Yes. Sometimes it is scary if  you think about it. Imagine what  governments can do if they choose.,Fearful
834,Probably already doing something.  There is probably a record somewhere of what I listen to on Spotify and what type of person that makes me.,Fearful
834,Yes. They can be as intrusive as they want.,Neutral
834," I wonder what they'd make of me if I start playing ""All I Want For Christmas"", constantly in March.  They'd probably just think I was a lunatic.",Curious to dive deeper
834,Or maybe that you were thinking ahead.,Surprised
834," Maybe I should really think ahead and get my Holiday shopping done now, play that song, and put up the tree.",Neutral
834,I know people who start shopping after labor day,Happy
834," Well I'm going to say goodbye, log into Spotify, and play ""All I Want For Christmas"".  Have a good day.",Happy
835," I think the special camp is really valuable, it helps a lot of kids",Curious to dive deeper
835," Yeah, it is a great opportunity for refugee kids to learn a great sport!",Curious to dive deeper
835," It is right, like Quriesh Ahmad, he liked soccer, sports can really save the lives  of people",Curious to dive deeper
835,I think the latest count is 95 kids signed up for the camp!,Neutral
835," Thats a lot of kids, all of them are refugees, escaping danger from their countries, kind of breaks my heart",Sad
835," It really does.  It is bad enough those things are happening, but to kids just kills me.",Neutral
835," I know right, thankfully theres a place that rescues them, the nonprofit LACES really does a good job",Sad
835,They do!  I am glad to see a positive change in this world,Neutral
835," Yeah Life and Change Experienced Thru Sports, they also have a great name, says it all",Curious to dive deeper
835," It really does.  Sports can provide so much for the youth, especially in places where there is no other reprieve from daily life.",Neutral
835," I think that the coaches that volunteer their time are also to thank, they dont charge and still dedicate their time to those kids,",Curious to dive deeper
835,Soccer truly is a world wide sport.  There is a German soccer player who donated his world cup victory bonus to  pay for surgery for 23 Brazilian kids.,Neutral
835," Do you know his name? that is a great deed, I love soccer by the way",Curious to dive deeper
835,Mesut Ozil,Neutral
835," Oh he is a great player, do you like soccer?",Curious to dive deeper
835,I do.  It is one of my favorite sports.,Neutral
835,I cant beleive there are more than 250 million players world wide,Curious to dive deeper
835,It is so popular it makes more than most other sports combined!,Neutral
835," And its played in over 200 countries, that is impressive",Curious to dive deeper
835,It is impressive indeed.  There is even a version where three teams square off.,Neutral
835," I havent seen that version but it does seem interesting, I might have to Google that like right now. ",Curious to dive deeper
836," Hello there, what are your thoughts on basketball?",Curious to dive deeper
836,I like the sport a lot. I just can't believe that there are only five players at a time on each side. It always seems like more.,Surprised
836," True, the dunk was so bad because of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in college it got banned for years.",Surprised
836," Yeah, I heard it was banned from college basketball for over a decade! ",Surprised
836," I think the NBA has changed a lot with so many more 3 point shots being taken, it is hard to defend that much of the court.",Surprised
836," Yeah, that could be. It's hard to believe that in 39 out of 50 states the highest paid employee is either a college football or basketball coach.",Disgusted
836," Well look at Air Jordans, that shoe accounts for 33% of all money on shoes spent on ebay.",Surprised
836,Does it really?Did you know that Jordan's were banned upon introduction by the NBA?,Surprised
836," Yes it was around 1984 I think, I think this is what jumpstarted Nike into the powerhouse they have become.",Surprised
836," Yes, rapper Drake even owns a pair of solid gold Jordan's.",Curious to dive deeper
836," I do think it has gotten out of hand though, a 16 year old killed another teen in Washington over a pair of Air Jordans.  That is sad.",Sad
836,That is sad. Murder over a $250 pair of shoes. Senseless.,Sad
836,Yeah the defense claims the 3 teenage witnesses were lying.  They apparently were the only evidence.  Must have been ironclad.,Sad
836,Terrible. I wonder if MJ did anything for the family considering he held the record for the single highest paid season?,Angry
836," I doubt it, I mean the logo of his jumping isn't how he jumps either.",Surprised
836," Yeah, it's ironic that it is from a photo shoot of MJ doing the ballet move grand jete and had nothing to do with how he jumps!",Surprised
836," I actually have a pair of Air Jordans from the 90s, I made sure to leave tea bags after I wore them for a while to reduce the smell!",Happy
836," Oh, I've heard to do that with shoes. I find it amazing the Stephon Marbury promoted a line of shoes for $15 and was not paid to endorse them.",Happy
836,Yeah there are some good athletes in the world like Steve Smith who leaves his cleats on the bench to remind people of homelessness and people without shoes.,Happy
836," I have heard about that. I find it interesting that not only were shoes around so long ago, but a pair of shoes 5000 years old performs better than modern day shoes.",Happy
836," Goes with the saying ""don't make them like they used to"", thanks for the chat.",Happy
836," Yes, agreed. Good chatting.",Happy
837,hi,Neutral
837," It's sad that our world is coming to this, teenagers killing each other over $250 sneakers!",Disgusted
837,the society's morality is becoming worst,Sad
837," Yes, at least on the other hand we can appreciate that there are people like the witnesses relative came forward and contacted authorities. ",Curious to dive deeper
837," I concur.  By the way, do you know that air jordan account for 1 in every 3 dollars spent on sneakers on ebay",Surprised
837," I'm surprised, I am not that in to brand name shoes at all! I would rather a fun unique pair like the one inspired by the Wizard of Oz inspired shoes with the gps inside!",Curious to dive deeper
837,Hahaha.  I have never bought a pair of Air Jordan.  YOu?,Neutral
837," No, I haven't I don't make that much money! I wear basic 2010's style sandals",Curious to dive deeper
837,so do I.  I think it is such a waste of money buying trending products.,Neutral
837," Exactly I can't believe some people live so decadently, like Queen Elizabeth have people to wear shoes for them before hand so they are more comfortable, I bet that costs a lot and doesn't even skim the surface of all of the servants she has. ",Angry
837," Btw, do you know that rapper Drake owns a pair of solid gold air jordan sneakers weight about 100 pounds",Surprised
837," That's exactly what I am talking about , that's just way too much decadence! ",Disgusted
837," Agree.  I am not a fan of such living style.  Btw, do you like basketball",Sad
837," Well, I never followed basketball much, but I did really enjoy the movie Space Jam- and I think a lot of my generation did since it was the highest-grossing basketball film of al time!",Curious to dive deeper
837," Yeah, I watched that movie, and I liked it",Happy
837,It was funny. It did make basketball seem pretty fun but I've never been able to follow all of the rules like understanding the different in points between a field goal made behind or in front of the three-point line.,Curious to dive deeper
837," Yeah.  The rule is a bit complicated if you do not watch the game often.  Also, do you know that a professional ballet dancer use 4 pairs of pointe shoes per week",Surprised
837," No, I didn't. I wonder if other professionals with shoes designed for them specifically, like mountaineers and skiers, use more than one pair like that?",Curious to dive deeper
837,nice chatting with you.  Have a happy holiday,Happy
837," You too, thank you!",Happy
837,Bye,Happy
837,Bye,Neutral
838,Hi there are you a big basketball fan?,Curious to dive deeper
838," Not really, do you watch basketball much?",Curious to dive deeper
838,I do. Are you familiar with Kareem Abdul Jabbar?,Curious to dive deeper
838," Yes, I've seen him playing basketball and I think I've even seen him on late night shows. Are you a fan of his?",Curious to dive deeper
838,I was when I was growing up.  He dunked so much in college that they banned the shot for almost a decade.,Happy
838,Did you ever have a pair of Air Jordan shoes? I few boys in my high school did. They all played basketball.,Curious to dive deeper
838,I never had any.  Wish I did though.  Speaking of shoes....professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.,Happy
838,That's amazing! They must have such a passion and dedication to dance...and they must need very special shoes. Did you hear about the teens in the news and the Air Jordans?,Curious to dive deeper
838,I haven't heard that.  What is the news about?,Happy
838," I guess one teen had a pair of Air Jordans, and another demaded them from him. He ran away and was chased, said witnesses, and they heard gunshots soon after. It's terrible! Over shoes!",Sad
838,Oh my gosh.  That's terrible.  I just read that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shows.  I don't see how that's possible.,Happy
838," I imagine they were made with thicker leather. People used to walk much more, I think, so their shoes had to be tough, right?",Curious to dive deeper
838,I guess so.  lol  I have really smelly feet and they make my shoes smell bad.  Any tips on how to get rid of the smell in my shoes?,Curious to dive deeper
838," Yes, I have heard that you can put tea bags or coffee grounds in nylons in them to take the smell out. Also I've hard of putting those fabric softener sheets in shoes. Seems legit.",Neutral
838,Ahh...sweet.  Thanks! LOL  Stephon Marbury (basketball player) promoted a line of shoes that retailed at $15 but he was not paid to endorse them.  Interesting.,Happy
838,That's very interesting! ...and I almost forgot to say about the ballet pointe shoes...Bill Nye the Science guy has a patent on those. I wonder how he got into that?,Curious to dive deeper
838,Wow.  How interesting is that?  Never knew that before just now.  I like what NFL wide receiver Steve Smith does.  He leaves his cleats on the field after every game to raise awareness for homeless people without shoes.,Happy
838," That's pretty interesting about his shoes, but I wonder what happens to them? I wonder if they'd ever do a show with pro basketball players taking homeless fans out to lunch?",Curious to dive deeper
838,I'm not sure what they do with them.  That would be great if they did that.  There was a player who played in Cleveland that would take out food to the homeless after every home game.  I think he plays for Boston now.  He also does it when his team is on the road.,Happy
838," That sounds like a great idea. Speaking of which, I have some old shoes I'm going to go donate to the homeless. TTYL",Happy
838,Nice!  It was fun chatting!  Have a good day!,Happy
839,Hi there.  You feel like being a little scientific today?,Curious to dive deeper
839,Yes I am. Did you know Pluto isn't a planet? I thought NASA had reversed that decision a few years ago.,Surprised
839,Not sure what the status is now.  A dwarf planet?  Maybe that's the difference?,Curious to dive deeper
839," A dwarf planet is still a planet by name. Pluto is not longer a planet at all. I think it was found to not be a solid mass or maybe too much gas? I think another planet, Jupiter is made of gas and rock, and it is still a planet. Decisions on space are strange.",Curious to dive deeper
839,Constantly changing with more  research.  Amazing actually.  Wonder what they named that planet that precipitates shards of glass. Weird.  Almost sounds scifi,Curious to dive deeper
839,You think that's SciFi? In 2010 an ambassador for any future extraterrestrials who might make contact was appointed by the UN. If decisions made with space are altered by more research- what lead to that decision?,Curious to dive deeper
839," It's a tough job, but somebody has to do it.  LOL  The emperor of Japan is a scientist.  Didn't know that.",Neutral
839," Yep, his name is Akihito. He still involves himself in scientific research today. Harrison Schmitt is the only scientist to walk on the moon. Which FYI, along with the sun controls ocean tides. Boom! Science!",Happy
839," Fascinating.  And to think when earth was first formed, a day was on 5.5 hours long.  Definitely needed daylight savings time!!!",Surprised
839," Heck no, you would lose or gain half a day. Big mess LOL! I thought they found life on Mars, but it's been reported only Earth harbors life.",Surprised
839,I thought they did too unless maybe some things that could sustain life as we know it.,Curious to dive deeper
839,Maybe that's why I assumed they found life was because they found water. Earth's surface is covered in about 71% water.,Neutral
839,Was watching that series Mars.  It had factual commentaries throughout it.  Guess they're serious about seeing what exactly it holds for us in the future.,Curious to dive deeper
839," I would like to know. We can;t be the only planet to have harbored life. Why are we so special? It can't just be coincidence. I mean if humans are but a minute if earth history was put into 24 hours, who are we to judge what's in the history of other planets. We barely know this one.",Surprised
839,Exactly.  We're just a speck out there.  Unfortunately I'll never see it.  Just great to see all the research continuing.,Happy
839," Me either. I can only read about it and imagine. But at least them my imagination plays a part, and it's quite interesting. What if we have a mirror planet around another sun somewhere. Another planet being destroyed by humans. Well, my imagination just got sad. Dang.",Sad
839,I've always thought along those lines too. Guess I'll go out tonight and look up at the stars!!  Great chatting with you and a great subject.,Happy
839," You too, space really is fascinating. It's the only things every one can see together from across the world!",Happy
839,Nice concept. Something we all share.,Happy
839,Exactly. Space and Earth is a gift to us all. Nice talk!,Happy
839,May the force be with you!!,Happy
840,Do you use or watch Youtube?,Curious to dive deeper
840," Yes, i watch youtube all the time. do you watch youtube?",Neutral
840,I do you can learn anything on there. In November of 2006 they were bought by google for 1.65 billion.,Curious to dive deeper
840,I did not know that google owns youtube. you have a lot of knowledge about youtube.,Happy
840," A bunch of useless knowledge, lol! What do you watch Youtube for?",Curious to dive deeper
840,i watch mostly people cooking and organizing.. it makes time pass,Happy
840,Yeah i generally get music from there but if i'm stuck on something like fixing my car or computer then it's good to have.,Curious to dive deeper
840," i agree, i was able to learn alot of things through youtube, its very helpful at times. did you here about the momo challenge? ",Happy
840," No i didn't, what's that?",Curious to dive deeper
840," momo is telling kids to do bad things while their parents are sleeping,",Sad
840,Oh my God that needs to be stopped immediately. I don't know how i haven't heard of this. What kind of stuff? I do know youtube is the second largest search engine on the internet.,Curious to dive deeper
840," like turning on the oven, sticking forks into the electrical sockets, really bad stuff.",Neutral
840,Wow that's terrible. Netflix and youtube together make up for half of peak hour traffic.,Curious to dive deeper
840," im sure, i got my cable disconnected and subscribed to both nextflix and Hulu ",Neutral
840,Me too friend. Police actually have their own youtube its called bluetube.,Curious to dive deeper
840," lol thats awesome, im gonna have to check it out. thanks",Happy
840,Do you know who Kim Kardashian is?,Curious to dive deeper
840," yes, she has a huge social media following. She's known for dating r jay and is now the wife of kanye west. ",Happy
840,Right she also use to be Paris Hilton's personal assistant.,Curious to dive deeper
840,now she probably has more money than paris.,Happy
840," I'm sure, She even written a book. Nice chatting with you. ",Curious to dive deeper
841,Did you know youtube is the second largest search engine on the net?,Neutral
841," No, I didn't know that, but I suppose it makes sense now that I think about it. What kind of YouTube videos do you like?",Curious to dive deeper
841,Im into diy stuff and reviews on certain items. What about you?,Neutral
841," Mostly entertainment and celebrity news, stuff like that. I kind of love to hate the Kardashians.",Neutral
841,its crazy how much success they have! They're marketing team is really good. Being famous for being famous,Surprised
841," Yeah, but it's super weird. I don't think anyone ever heard of them until fairly recently. Where did they even come from? I don't know if it's because they knew the right people or what... I mean, the Jenners are known because (formerly) Bruce Jenner was an actor, but other than that, I have no idea.",Curious to dive deeper
841,Kim use to be Paris Hiltons personal assistant. But got a lot of attention for dating singer ray J,Neutral
841," Ah. And then married Kanye. Good for her, I guess.",Disgusted
841,Shes surprisingly not the only famous one in her family. Kylie has made a huge name for herself,Neutral
841," Yes, but again, she doesn't seem to actually do much of anything. Really I think the whole family could do with less attention. I do think it was a good decision to keep her pregnancy low-key, at least at first. People like to make a big deal about celebrities' personal lives when it's really none of their business.",Neutral
841," Thats true, they are just normal people deep down. But thats what happens when your famous. I guess its the cost of getting so much money",Neutral
841,It's honestly a little creepy how obsessive people get over celebrities. Like freaking out on social media when she wasn't in the Christmas card picture.,Surprised
841,Its not like they aren't soaking in the attention though. They are everywhere on social media,Neutral
841," That's true. Kim even wrote a book about how much she takes selfies and was a force behind the 'selfie movement.' So yeah, not really doing anything to discourage attention. And, as we mentioned, that's kind of all they're famous for.",Neutral
841,Kylies youtube page posted an 11 min video that documented her pregnancy,Neutral
841," Lol, so much for keeping it private. I feel sorry for all their kids. It has to be weird growing up with all that going on. Do you think they ever get the chance to be like normal kids?",Curious to dive deeper
841,I highly doubt it. They grew up with the cameras in their face. I wouldn't be surprised if they are already considered social media influencers,Curious to dive deeper
841," I'm not going to go looking for them, but I wouldn't be surprised if Kim and Kanye's three kids already have social media accounts.",Curious to dive deeper
841,There is probably this family wouldnt do to stay relevant Somehow their tv show still runs,Surprised
841," Well, as long as people buy into it, I guess you can't blame them for doing what works. Kim was the highest-paid tv personality in 2015, making more than $53 million. I can think of a few things I'd do with that much money.",Neutral
841,Kylie is the youngest billionaire as well so I guess I wouldnt complain in their situation,Neutral
842,Do you follow Kylie Jenner?,Curious to dive deeper
842," No, I don't. Who is that? What does she do?",Neutral
842," She's a singer, a pretty good one actually, she announced she is pregnant to the world during the Billboard Music Awards",Curious to dive deeper
842,Is she related to Bruce Jenner at all? Or did she succeed on her own?,Neutral
842," Yeah I think Bruce Jenner is her dad, I think it was a mixture of both, having a rich and influential dad can always help",Curious to dive deeper
842,Rich kids get advantages. It doesn't bother me so much when they actually have talent. So she's related to Kim Kardashian then.,Neutral
842,Yeah the Kardashians are her half sisters.,Curious to dive deeper
842,Kim Kardashian used to be Paris Hilton's personal assistant.,Curious to dive deeper
842," I think she's famous because of her dad, you know he was part of the defense team of OJ Simpson.",Curious to dive deeper
842," Yeah, I saw a show about that. David Schwimmer was the dad. I think the family was different before the fame. Now Kim has a book about her being ""a trailblazer of the ‘selfie movement'"". titled: Selfish. ??? LOL. ",Neutral
842," I dont know about that lol but I do know that Kim was in one of the music videos of the band Fall Out Boy, I used to love that band",Curious to dive deeper
842,I don't know their stuff. I understand that she would bring attention to the video.,Neutral
842," She is a curious character indeed, so do you like rap music?",Curious to dive deeper
842," I'm not really a fan of rap, though I can see it takes talent to do it well. ",Neutral
842," I agree, it must require a lot of talent, do you know who Eminem is?",Curious to dive deeper
842," Eminem is a famous rapper, though I don't his songs. I saw him in a movie called Eight Mile.",Neutral
842," That was a great movie, sad how he had to struggle in the way he did, he almost became a comic book artist",Curious to dive deeper
842," He probably would have been a good one, though not as rich. He should start a comic book. ",Neutral
842," Now that he has the money it would be a good idea, maybe he can come up with the next Batman or Superman. ",Curious to dive deeper
842,That would be good. Or many a hero rapper that does battle through fiery rhymes.,Neutral
842," Busta Rhymes is another talented rapper, he was he voice of the Reptar Wagon in the Rugrats Movie. ",Curious to dive deeper
843,CLimate change is getting dangerous. The Carbon dioxide keeps getting higher each month,Fearful
843,We really need to start acting on this. The carbon dioxide has exceeded 410 ppm this is unacceptable.,Angry
843,Right!!. The gases are even getting bad getting to be 46 percent higher the last time they did a check in Hawaii,Fearful
843,That's bad. The carbon dioxide concentration are causing the greenhouse gas effect and trapping heat and driving climate change. People need to understand this.,Angry
843,The rising growth rate of this plant each year is making it harder to even handle.,Fearful
843,True.But Antarctica is losing tens of meters of ice and it's raising sea levels. This can be very bad.,Angry
843,sad to learn that 80 percent of the earth's natural forest have been lost. Whats next!,Fearful
843," Yes I know, very depressing. Helium we are also losing apparently but not sure why.",Curious to dive deeper
843,mayeb somthing to do with the process of how the plants provide energy. Scientist are the ones who know the answers for sure. Crazy how being called a scientist only came around during the 19th century,Neutral
843,Yeah that is kind of interesting. They are very important though. For example the World Wide Web was invented by an English scientist.,Happy
843,very cool to learn. They start off very young know how to be awesome intelligent humans. much like the young john von neumann,Neutral
843,Yes that's a very good comparison. Harvard scientist's managed to store a GIF animation of a galloping horse in the DNA of a bacteria how is that even possible?,Curious to dive deeper
843,It's something smarter than we can even put into words lol...much like how is our planet is the only one to have life on it?,Curious to dive deeper
843," I also raise that question! In modern times, many scientists have advanced degrees in an area of science and pursue careers in various sectors of the economy  like academia, industry, government, and nonprofits.",Curious to dive deeper
843,Maye its all our water. 71% of it is covered by it.,Curious to dive deeper
843,So many deep oceans! Even on land there is much water like lakes and rivers.,Neutral
843," Oh yeah I know, I'm from Michigan, many lakes there....I did learn they have whole building blocks of other land far way from the earth. But we cant really get there",Curious to dive deeper
843,Maybe someday. Earth is actually the densest planet in the solar system.,Curious to dive deeper
843,Wonder what that all means to how we live. Wonder what it means that Uranus rotates on its side and rolls round the moon. So fascinating,Curious to dive deeper
843,Yes all good questions. I always wonder about aliens too. In 2010 the United Nations appointed a official ambassador to extraterrestrials in case they would ever make contact with the earth! It was great chatting with you today I had fun.,Surprised
843,ET come home lol,Curious to dive deeper
844," Hello, do you watch Youtube?",Curious to dive deeper
844," Yea, I've been watching youtube since it was created in 2005",Neutral
844," Awesome,  love Youtube.  Its the second largest search engine on the net. ",Curious to dive deeper
844,Must be why Google bought youtube in 2006 for 1.65 billion,Neutral
844," Yeah,  now google and youtube have the top spots of search engines.",Curious to dive deeper
844," Combined with Netflix Youtube makes up half of peak internet traffic in North America, that's a lot of streaming",Surprised
844," Yeah that is insane.  Justin biebers ""baby"" video is the most disliked video lol",Curious to dive deeper
844," Ugh, there most like video Gangnam style isn't much better either",Neutral
844," Haha thats a really funny video though,  it doesnt make any sense though.",Curious to dive deeper
844," No, neither  does the youtube rip off blutube used by Police",Neutral
844,Is it just a channel on Youtube or a whole different site?,Curious to dive deeper
844," I think blutube is just another site, I'd check it out but I honestly don't care",Neutral
844,Do you like Kim Kardashian?,Curious to dive deeper
844," Not at all, she only famous for a tape she made with Ray J, in my opinion.",Disgusted
844," Yeah i remember that,  I guess she used to be Paris Hiltons personal assistant. I personally think that whole family is kinda ridiculous. I think she is married to Kanye west too right?",Curious to dive deeper
844," Yea, him and Kim have 3 children.",Sad
844," Oh wow,  I guess Ive missed a lot lol I did not know they have 3 children now.  I know their family makes a lot of money for reality shows and businesses where Im pretty sure they do nothing. lol",Curious to dive deeper
844,Nothing but taking selfies and writing stupid books about it,Angry
844," Yeah,  and america loves it for some reason.  Buying their product and watching their shows,  america is just making them more money lol ",Curious to dive deeper
844," Yea, none of their stuff will make it in the library of Congress like Tupac's music. Well it was nice chatting with you",Neutral
844," great conversation, thank you very much. ",Neutral
845,hi how are you? what do you think of this planet of ours?,Neutral
845," well what can I say, humans destroyed 80% of the earth's natural forests. ",Neutral
845," Yeah, we are well on the way to destroying the last 20 per cent too it seems. ",Neutral
845," yeah apparently the earth changed a lot from when it was first formed, The days were only 5.5 hours long.",Neutral
845," now it is just over 24 hours. soon it will be 30, 40 hours and the work day will be even longer. no thanks!",Neutral
845,yeah well at the end of the 21st century the earth will be helium-free,Fearful
845," maybe we can develop trees that produce helium! that would solve the problem. more forests, more helium.",Neutral
845," yeah that would be good, but I'm not sure how that would work with all of this climate change ",Neutral
845," Yeah, we need more forests. or we could move to another planet. that might be easier. LOL",Neutral
845," yeah we could move to Venus, it does not tilt so there are no seasons there.",Neutral
845," Yeah, but it's like 900 degrees. a bit hot. the soviets send a probe there. it disappeared pretty fast.",Neutral
845,maybe they can invent a space suit that could keep us cool. see humans are destroying earth but they should be taking care of it because it is the only place we can survive.,Neutral
845,quite true. we need to think a bit more about the actions we have taken and how much longer we can keep doing the same thing.,Neutral
845,yeah 71% of the earth's surface is covered with water,Neutral
845,we need to preserve the creatures there as well. overfishing and pollution are terrible problems.,Neutral
845," they are very serious problems, I really hope it gets better",Neutral
845," Well, astronomers have detected building blocks of life in a planetary system some 455 light-years away. Maybe we could go there? Lets talk to Elon.",Neutral
845," that sounds really interesting, I wonder if they have oxygen there.",Neutral
845," I guess we could bring a converter. anyway, great chat!",Neutral
845,thank you have a nice day,Neutral
845,Have a great day!,Neutral
845,bye,Neutral
846," Hi, how are you?",Happy
846,Hello. What do you think about scientists?,Neutral
846,I love them! I studied science at college for 3 years. Then organic chemistry suggested I try another line of study. What do you think abouto scientists?,Happy
846,I feel that scientists whose sole purpose to research to advance knowledge in a specific area of interest have helped advanced the world in leaps and bounds,Neutral
846,I do too! Do you believe them in their research?,Curious to dive deeper
846," In most cases yes. However, I do think that each person has to do their due diligence to identify if there is any bias or misinformation.",Neutral
846,I agree. The only reason I asked was because of people second guessing the global warming research. Seems odd to me..,Sad
846,I feel its because for many people of authority like the current president denies it for political reasons. I still can't believe people feel vaccines cause autism,Surprised
846,I know. Now there is a measels outbreak which will jeopardize the health of new borns who cannot get vaccinated. Just dumb...,Angry
846,Scientists have also made vast contributions to learning more about planets such as the earth,Neutral
846,I am mad they got rid of pluto though. I had such hopes for that planet.,Happy
846,When the problem was all in the current definition of things and at times it is simply a matter of semantics. Even jupiter's moon would be considered a planet due to its size and features if it instead orbited the sun instead of jupiter,Neutral
846," That is really insightful, thanks! Did you know the world wide web was invented in 1989?",Curious to dive deeper
846,Do you know who invented it?,Curious to dive deeper
846," I do not, who?",Curious to dive deeper
846,I don't know either. I was asking lol. I'm sure it was a scientist. All I remember was that the internet was developed by the military and wifi was developed as a byproduct when the space program was trying to improve space imaging.,Neutral
846,Didn't al gore say he invented it? Then he got mocked by the press and then he was actually involved with it????,Curious to dive deeper
846,If that is true that a shame,Neutral
846,Well at least the emperor of japen still publishes today.,Happy
846," That is amazing. I wonder what his field of expertise and interest is. In modern times, scientists have changed academia, industry, government, and nonprofit environments to an exponential degree",Surprised
846,I am not sure. It was nice chatting with you today!,Happy
847,Hello hows it going?  Do you like reading?,Neutral
847," Hello, I am good thank you.  I do enjoy reading, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
847," Yes,  very much.  Did you know Starship troopers was a recommended reading book to us militaries?",Surprised
847," No, I didn't know that, I didn't even know that was a book. ",Curious to dive deeper
847,It was a great movie too!,Surprised
847,Yeah I saw the movie it was good.  Did you know in the 18th century there was a moral panic because of the spread of the reading of novels?,Curious to dive deeper
847," That is surprising,  reading is good for people,  why would there be a panic about it lol ",Surprised
847," I know right, back to the military, I guess Ender's Game was suggested reading for the marine corps. ",Curious to dive deeper
847," Nice!  I never read that one,  just seen the movie.  ",Surprised
847," Also, the world record for speed reading was a speed of 4700 words per minute!",Curious to dive deeper
847,lol now that's crazy! Do you even process information that fast?  or just read the words?  That is a lot!,Surprised
847,Yeah I don't even know how you could make sense of that many words that quickly.,Curious to dive deeper
847,yeah right!  It looks like the biggest selling non fiction book is the Bible!,Surprised
847,I could see that.  Did you know that George w Bush read 14 biographies of Lincoln during his presidency?,Curious to dive deeper
847,Yes and almost 200 historical non fiction books!  He was focused!,Surprised
847,Yeah I don't know how you could read that many biographies about one person though!,Curious to dive deeper
847," lol I could,  if I was really interested in their life.  ",Surprised
847," But still, I can see reading 5 but not 14 lol.  I guess the FDA once burned 6 tons of literature in an act of US censorship. ",Curious to dive deeper
847," That is a big statement.  I did not know that Winston Churchill won a Nobel Prize,  that is interesting. ",Surprised
847," Wow, I didn't know that either, very interesting. ",Curious to dive deeper
847," Well it was good chatting,  have a good one. ",Surprised
848," Hi , do you like to read?",Happy
848,Hi there I do like to read. What about you? But I guess I only like audiobooks haha don't actually read the physical book,Happy
848,I love to read.I found interesting that the Bible was considered the non fiction book that had the biggest sales!,Happy
848," Wow that is interesting. have you ever heard of the blind reading language Braille? It was created by Louis Braille who did it when he was only 15, that's impressive!",Surprised
848," Wow that is so impressive ,I had no idea he was so young , I will not forget that now.  Did you know reading novels was causing a moral panic in the 18th century?",Happy
848,No that's really silly though haha. Can you imagine if people were worried today about everyone suddenly reading lol. Do you know what a reading bicycle is?,Curious to dive deeper
848," no, tell me about it! something I know is that literature was, long time ago, an olympic event!",Surprised
848," Haha no, it was actually something they invented for schools. They would put a reading bicycle into elementary schools and apparently the test scores skyrocketed after that",Happy
848," When there is something fun , it is way easier to learn. Did you hear bout a competition called ""you laugh you lose? """,Happy
848," No I didn't hear about that, can you tell me more? Interesting that of Amazon's top five best-selling book, four of them were nonfiction, I wonder what they were",Surprised
848," It was a competition held by Cs lewis and Tolkien It looks like they had to hold their laugh when reading terrible poetry. I could not have done that, I would have lost",Happy
848,Yep I would have lost too. Also I feel bad for the people that wrote those poems. Just think about if they knew who was laughing at them LOL,Curious to dive deeper
848,Poor poetry writers!! I did not know George w Bush enjoyed reading so much,Happy
848," I didn't know that either. Have you ever read a book by Terry Pratchett before? Apparently he was knighted for his work, specifically his""services to literature""",Curious to dive deeper
848," I have not read from him, but it is a very good reference that he was knighted. Did you know that the fda did an act of censorship and burned 6 tons of literature?",Happy
848,No I didn't know that. That's kind of scary actually. I wonder why they would burn the books? Did you know that romantic kissing is actually a recent invention?,Surprised
848," That is pretty cute, I think is interesting  that music , sculpture and painting were olimpyc events!!",Happy
848,That is really interesting. I wonder how those work because they're so subjective? Do you like heavy metal? There is a professor who teaches heavy metal as a form of literature apparently,Surprised
848," I love rock, but I think that professor would have been burned by the FDA... talking about the olympic events for music, painting etc, this happened from 1912 to 1952.",Happy
848," I see. Have you heard of President Andrew Jackson? You never actually went to school, it was his wife who helped him to learn how to read, and he became the president so I guess that's awesome!",Surprised
848,Cool!! it was nice talking to you! have a good one,Happy
849,do you like reading?,Curious to dive deeper
849,I do. Did you ever read Starship Troopers?,Curious to dive deeper
849,Yes and it is recommended by the military branches as well,Curious to dive deeper
849," Yes true, same with Ender's Game that is a popular one among the military too",Curious to dive deeper
849,Yes. Do you know who holders the record for speed reading,Curious to dive deeper
849,That would be Anne Jones at 4700 words per minute,Curious to dive deeper
849,Yeah I wonder how they even measure that though to be honest,Curious to dive deeper
849,True. DO you know who TOlkien and CS Lewis were?,Curious to dive deeper
849," Yes great authors and they used to play you laugh, you lose games with each other",Curious to dive deeper
849,Yes and it must have been hard because it was over bad poetry,Curious to dive deeper
849,Yeah. There was moral panic in the 18th century because people were reading novels,Curious to dive deeper
849,Weird. Do you like non-fiction?,Curious to dive deeper
849,Yes I do. George Bush read 186 historical nonfictions when he was a president,Curious to dive deeper
849," Yeah and 14 biographies of Lincoln, he must know a lot about him",Curious to dive deeper
849,Yeah I bet so too. Jimmy Buffet the country singer is also a talented writer,Curious to dive deeper
849,Yes he had a fiction and nonfiction reach number one in the NY best seller list,Curious to dive deeper
849,Nice. Do you know which is the best selling nonfiction book?,Curious to dive deeper
849," That would be the bible, it holds the guiness record too",Curious to dive deeper
849," Yeah, Did you know Jack London was really poor once?",Curious to dive deeper
849," Yes and that is what his book talks about mainly, the divide between the rich and the poor, in the people of abbyss",Curious to dive deeper
849," Yeah, that was early 1900. Nice chatting with you",Happy
850,I really like to read. Do you enjoy reading?,Curious to dive deeper
850," Reading is fun, and fundamental! How are you today? Have you read anything?",Curious to dive deeper
850," I am good. I have read many, many books. Did you know that Winston Churchill won a Nobel Prize for literature?",Curious to dive deeper
850," I didn't know that! However, I'm not surprised. POTUS Andrew Johnson never  went to school. His wife helped him learn to read. ",Surprised
850," I'm very glad that someone did. Oddly, literature was an Olympic event from 1912 to 1952. How odd. ",Surprised
850," That sounds very strange! I've never heard that. I wonder why literature would be in the Olympics. Perhaps in combination with other activities, it would make sense to be in the Olympics. For example, an elementary school used reading bicycles and test scores went up.",Neutral
850," That's interesting. I wonder why. It's not the only strange Olympic sport. During those same years architecture, music, painting, and sculpture were also Olympic events. ",Neutral
850," Romantic kissing is a fairly recent development, so I guess that wouldn't be in the Olympics yet. What about heavy metal music? Some guy in Texas teachers it as a form of literature. Could be in the Olympics someday.",Neutral
850,That's a good question. I was saddened to learn that the FDA burned six tons of literature in an act of censorship in the U.S. That's upsetting.,Angry
850," Sometimes people think that they're helping when they don't realize that they are in fact destroying a legacy. I might not listen to heavy metal, but I wouldn't destroy it out of some sense of righteousness. Do you read non-fiction at all?",Curious to dive deeper
850,I sometimes do. I know that unsurprisingly the bible is the best selling non-fiction book. But I question how many of those are actually read.,Neutral
850," The book sells a lot, but few open it up. ""The Late Great Planet Earth"" is also a best-seller among Christians. It predicts the end of the world in our generation. Sold 35+ million copies. ",Neutral
850,I am not familiar with that one. Did you know that George W Bush read 14 biographies of Lincoln during his presidency?,Surprised
850," I wonder whether he read them aloud or silently. Silent reading is a recent thing. Centuries ago, few could read silently.",Curious to dive deeper
850,That's super weird. You would get very strange looks now. Are you familiar with Starship Troopers?,Curious to dive deeper
850,I've seen the film. I know it's based on a Heinlein novel.,Neutral
850,It is. It's on the reading lists of three of the five US military branches. What an odd choice.,Surprised
850," It's about strategy and tactics, though I don't know how relevant it is to the modern battlefield.",Neutral
850,Yes it seems like it would not be. Ender's Game was also suggested reading for military organizations.,Neutral
850,It's also a story involving a lot of strategy and tactics. I think the military wants to pick stuff that troops will enjoy and understand. The Art of War might be a bit heavy for the average person.,Neutral
850,Oh I'm positive of that.,Neutral
851,Do you know much about book banning in schools?,Curious to dive deeper
851,I know a little. I know banning those two books would cost me two of my favorite books.,Sad
851," Are either of your favorite books ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" or ""Huckleberry Finn""? Those are ones that come up often.  ",Disgusted
851," yes, I love them both. I named my dog Scout after To Kill a Mocking bird.",Curious to dive deeper
851," Harper Lee addressed a Virginia school board about their removal of her book, because they said it was ""immoral"".",Neutral
851,She just released a new follow up to To Kill a Mockingbird.,Surprised
851," Does it happen in the same area of the South, at the same time with the same characters?",Curious to dive deeper
851,I am not sure. I have not read it yet. Did you read those two books?,Curious to dive deeper
851," I read both ""Huckleberry Finn"" and ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" when I was in school.  My local school board didn't seem to have any problem with the N-word or other racial slurs in them.",Neutral
851,Mine either. I wonder if the sensitivity will cause them to miss out on other things or shelter them from other areas that make a well-rounded adult (please don't infer I am encouraging racism).,Curious to dive deeper
851,i agree with Harper Lee who stated that she didn't think that racial tension problems would be solved by banishing classics.,Neutral
851,Seems like she knows a lot about it. Seems reasonable to adovovate for your book.,Happy
851," Sometimes when books aren't banned a parent can request an alternative book, but personally it seem like you would miss out on the classroom discussions and learning if you are the only one reading it.",Surprised
851," Yeah. I agree. I haven't read to kill a mockingbird in a while and will need to re-read it. After all, there are more libraries in the US than McDonalds.",Surprised
851," And if  you don't want to read it in print form you can get it in another format, like audiobook, or you can use a device to read it as an e-book.",Neutral
851," How would you like to wheelbarrow 32,000 books 3/4 of a mile at age 85???",Happy
851," I hope i have that much strength at age 85, or such devotion to donate them to a library like Gladstone did. ",Happy
851,I know... MY 40 year old body aches when I get off the couch!,Happy
851," Well, you can get some media in a digital form from the library and stay on your couch if you want.",Neutral
851,Nice. My life just got a little lazier... Not sure if that is a good thing...,Neutral
851," If you need more stuff to do but don't have the equipment you could loan things from a library, they have library of things.",Neutral
851,Nice... Thanks for the chat!,Happy
852,Good morning! I'm going to the library today. Do you like to go to the library?,Happy
852,I adore libraries. It was my very first job in high school. There is nothing like the collection of knowledge in a library.,Curious to dive deeper
852,Have you ever heard the story of the guy who spent so much time studying in the prison library that he became a lawyer?,Surprised
852,I have heard of him. I wish more libraries were like sacramento where you can borrow things you need.,Neutral
852,I think that's so cool that you can borrow things other than books! I'm just excited I can borrow DVD's for free!,Happy
852,My kids love the dvd section. I like wandering the old books part. It has a smell that is like nothing else.,Neutral
852,I like older books too! My favorites are the old Mark Twain books,Curious to dive deeper
852,Mark Twain was a great american treasure. His books still are relevent today which is amazing.,Curious to dive deeper
852," They are such classics! He was much more successful as a writer than as a riverboat pilot, I'm sure!",Curious to dive deeper
852,Definately! I can totally see why him and tesla were friends. They were both quite the character.,Surprised
852,What else do you like to read? I enjoy sci-fi books as well,Curious to dive deeper
852,I love mystery novels. Which aparently caused a panic in 18th century society.,Surprised
852,I wonder if they thought people were going to start doing bad things because of them? Have you read Starship Troopers?,Curious to dive deeper
852,No I haven't. I'm more novels and short stories. Although I'd be fascinated to read the bad poetry from the lewis/tolkien competition.,Neutral
852,I can only imagine it is hilarious! I've heard the military encourages reading because it refines one's critical analysis.,Curious to dive deeper
852,I love that they are assigning books to help train. So often in our modern society we default to videos.,Curious to dive deeper
852,SO true! Reading gives the opportunity for the reader to come up with their own interpretation rather than blindly following instruction,Curious to dive deeper
852,It is so crucial for language acquistion too. I think that is why we have a disconect in communiction now days. Not a lot of people read beyond articles anymore.,Curious to dive deeper
852,At least we have people who donate their own time and resources to help push the idea of reading further!,Happy
852,The prime minister from england that donated his own collection to peopel who didn't have books warms my bibliophile heart.,Happy
852,and he was 85! and pushed them almost a mile! that's dedication,Surprised
852,A true believer in reading I'm sure! I think the way Norway supports authors is amazing.,Curious to dive deeper
852,I do too! You are guaranteed to sell at least a 1000 copies!,Happy
852,As an author that is a huge milestone.,Happy
853,Good morning!  It's cold here and might be the perfect day to curl up in a blanket and read.,Happy
853,Hello there! Yeah we got a ton of snow here last night.,Curious to dive deeper
853,Hope you don't have to go out in it soon.  Do you like to read?,Curious to dive deeper
853," Yeah same here, except I have to work tonight.  Yeah I read a little bit, how about yourself?",Curious to dive deeper
853," Well be careful when you do.  I really do like to read, but I probably don't spend enough time doing it.  It's too bad I'm not Anne Jones who is the world record speed reader and can read like 4,700 words/minute!",Surprised
853," Holy cow, I don't even know how one could understand that many words that quickly. ",Curious to dive deeper
853," I do wonder how much she is able to retain, but it's still impressive.Do you normally get your books from the library?",Curious to dive deeper
853,I haven't been to the library in a very long time no.  I guess the inventor of the brail system finished it at 15!,Curious to dive deeper
853,What did the braille system inventor finish?,Curious to dive deeper
853," The reading and writing system for the blind, the brail system. He invented it, and then perfected it by age 15. ",Curious to dive deeper
853,Wow.  That is pretty impressive!  Another thing that was impressive to me that I recently found out is that there are more libraries than McDonald's in the US!,Surprised
853," That is a really cool fact, I would never have guessed that as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
853," It seems like I pass three McDonald's to get to one library.  Apparently, not all libraries are for books.  In Sacramento they have a ""library of things"" where people can check out sewing machines and other short-term use items.",Surprised
853," Wow, that is a cool idea.  I think my local library is doing a similar thing.  Did you know many libraries carry video games?",Curious to dive deeper
853," I don't.  I knew mine carried videos and audiobooks, but didn't know about video games!",Surprised
853," Yeah I wonder what kinds they have, that would be awesome to rent old sega genesis games or other old consoles!",Curious to dive deeper
853,That would be cool.  Do you have any favorite authors?,Curious to dive deeper
853," Yeah it would be.  No, I don't really have a favorite, how about yourself?",Curious to dive deeper
853," I'm not sure I do, but I know Mark Twain is loved by a lot of people.",Neutral
853," Yeah I think people really like him.  I know my grandmother was a huge fan of Harper Lee, even had a signed copy of To Kill a Mockingbird. ",Curious to dive deeper
853," I've never read it, but I know that both that and Twain's ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" have been surrounded in controversy because of the use of the ""n""-word.",Sad
853," Yeah I have read that and also heard about it on the local radio stations as well.  Well it was nice talking with you today, I hope you have a good day. ",Curious to dive deeper
854,Hello - did you know a man was falsely imprisoned for 10 years and spent most of his time at the library to prove his innocence?,Surprised
854,I was not aware of that! That is interesting! Much cheaper than having to buy a lawyer! I do know there are more libraries than there are McDonald's in the US and that's a huge plus considering libraries are much more beneficial to us than Mickey D's!,Neutral
854,That's crazy,Surprised
854,I've always enjoyed libraries. But there's a library in Sacramento that actually allows you to check out useful stuff like sewing machines for temporary use that I've wanted to check out.,Neutral
854,Wow that's pretty cool.,Surprised
854,Libraries are certainly beneficial to those of us who love reading. Are you a fan of reading? I've been wanting to check out the book Starship Troopers as it's the first official sci-fi book on the reading lists of three of the US military branches!,Neutral
854,Yes they are. Did you know starship troopers is the first sci-fi novel on the reading list of the US military?,Surprised
854," I did and that's one of the reasons I want to read it to be honest! Of course, one day I'd like to beat Anne Jones' record reading speed of 4700 words per minute. Lol Realistically, that'll never happen with me but one can dream! Ha!",Happy
854,Haha that would be cool to beat that record!,Surprised
854," Indeed! It would be difficult though as the reading process requires continuous practice, development as well as refinement! ",Neutral
854,For sure! I saw there was a moral panic in the 18th century due to the spread of reading novels. LOL,Surprised
854," Wow! That's hard to believe! Wonder why? I bet CS Lewis and Tolkien had a good laugh about that during their ""You laugh, you lose"" competition.",Surprised
854,LOL yea I bet they did have a good laugh about that.,Surprised
854," Speaking of humor, I always enjoyed Mark Twain's humor. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn had some funny moments in it!",Happy
854,Yes it did. Did you know Nikola Tesla and Mark Twain were best friends?,Surprised
854,Really? That is so cool. I did not know that actually? I do know Edison filmed the only footage on record of Twain. I've always wanted to see it. Would be cool if he had footage of Tesla and Twain together!,Surprised
854,That would be cool. Did you know Thomas Edison filmed the only known footage of Mark Twain?,Curious to dive deeper
854," Yeah I did know about that and it's weird, isn't it? Twain had so many funny quips and statements. He once said cherimoya was the most delicious fruit known to man. Truer words have never been spoken! Ha!",Neutral
854,Very weird. Interesting!,Surprised
854," He also coined the word ""gullible"" which is a word I enjoy using. He used it to describe Tom Sawyer's buddies who were tricked into painting a fence!",Neutral
854,Good talking to you!,Happy
855," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
855," Hi! Doing great, you like listening to music?",Curious to dive deeper
855,I do like listening to music. Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
855," Yes, I especially enjoyed Lady Gaga's performance in the movie ""A Star is Born"", but what I like even more is James Corden and Alicia Keys remake of the lyrics on the song ""Shallow"" on his comedy show.",Happy
855,I love Lady Gaga. She seems so nice. Elton John named her his son's godmother.,Happy
855," That's pretty neat, I wonder what kind of gifts or treatment being the godson of Lady Gaga gets especially when she's had so many successful singles from ""Poker Face"" to ""Bad Romance"" to ""Just Dance"", I'm familiar with all of them!",Curious to dive deeper
855," When ever Poker Face comes on the radio, my son asks me ""How do you wake up Lady Gaga? Poker Face! HAHAHA!"" Gets me everytime!",Happy
855," Lol! That's hilarious! I'll have to tell that to my son next time, he's a goofball. He told me when Frozen came out and the songs kept playing over and over again and asked me whether I knew what that song really meant and referred to and I said ""No"" and he said it's talking about a fart and encouraging people to fart. Oh boys.",Happy
855," Geez! My son would love that. He loves poop and fart jokes, which he may or may not have gotten from me. I am not a mature man...",Happy
855," Lol, hear hear. I think it's hilarious watching my young kids talk and laugh so hard at such simple things. They also contribute to the data that from 9pm to 12am, Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in America. Are you a Netflix subscriber?",Curious to dive deeper
855,I am. Are you?,Curious to dive deeper
855," Yes and it's a great service especially since I've also been victim of the enormous fees for returning dvds late back when Blockbuster was alive. Reed Hastings, the found of Netflix, created Netflix because of the same fact!",Surprised
855,Blockbuster had the chance to buy Netflix for $50M and passed.,Sad
855," That is a bad move, Netflix is now worth 2 billion dollars since they and youtube together make up for half of peak internet traffic in the US!",Surprised
855," There's only 1 blockbuster left in the us and it's in Alaska. I remember when they tried to respond to the nextflix threat, much too late and failed miserably.",Happy
855," There's still a Blockbuster left?! I thought they declared bankruptcy, but then so many other stores have declared bankruptcy but I still see them, like Radio Shack, K-Mart, Sears, etc.",Surprised
855,bankruptcy is just protection against creditors. They can still operate but a lot just close because they are too far behind. There's no coming back. Like that $40 late fee you referenced!,Happy
855," Oh ok I see, and Toys R' Us too! It's crazy how a few companies have basically bankrupted these stores that were once kings in their industries!  Do you like astronomy?",Curious to dive deeper
855," I went into a toy r us when they were closing and it was the saddest thing ever. I looked at a capitalist dismantling, literally, of my romanticized childhood.",Sad
855," Exactly! I did the same thing and even then, the prices were still so much more expensive than Amazon! I tried to get toys about the solar systems but couldnt' find any.",Sad
855,Do you like the solar system?,Curious to dive deeper
855," Of course! Interesting to think that there are other planets like Uranus that rotates sideways and ""rolls"" around the sun rather than spin like other planets.",Surprised
855,[Immature giggle] Nice chatting with you!,Happy
856,Are you a fan of Netflix?,Curious to dive deeper
856,I am a fan. It's hard to believe that it was founded back in 1997.,Happy
856,I never knew that! I think they were mostly postal based during that time,Curious to dive deeper
856," Yes, even today Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth.",Happy
856," wow, that is crazy.  Could be why they have like 21 billion in debt!",Curious to dive deeper
856,Wow! That is a lot of debt. I wonder if Blockbuster is upset they didn't buy Netflix  after several offers to get it for $50 million. It is worth a lot more now!,Surprised
856," They are really kicking themselves now, I wonder how blockbuster is doing lol. ",Curious to dive deeper
856," I am not sure, there are no Blockbuster stores by me anymore.",Surprised
856," I think there is only one that exists now, and it does good business. Did you hear how netflix started?",Curious to dive deeper
856," No, I am not sure of how it started. Are you?",Happy
856,The owner got a 40 dollar late charge from blockbuster for apollo 13 and was upset over it. Big mistake blockbuster!,Curious to dive deeper
856,That is a big lat fee! Did you know the company expanded internationally in 2012?,Curious to dive deeper
856," Right, I didn't know it took until 2012 to expand. I heard it still isn't in china yet, that would be a huge market!",Curious to dive deeper
856," Yes, it might be. Half of peak internet traffic in North America is made up by Netflix and You Tube.",Happy
856," wow, I am part of both of those, mostly netflix though. Did you ever see the show lilyhammer?",Curious to dive deeper
856," No, I have never seen it. Why?",Curious to dive deeper
856," It was Netflix's original show they created. It was pretty good, I recommend it!",Curious to dive deeper
856,I'll have look into it! Thanks! Incredible that as of October 2018 they had 147 million worldwide subscribers.,Happy
856,wow so many! It was so nice chatting with you!,Curious to dive deeper
856,Nice chatting with you too.,Neutral
856,Thanks! Enjoy the rest of your day!,Curious to dive deeper
857,Do you like to watch movies?,Curious to dive deeper
857,I do like to watch movies.  They are generally well crafted escapist entertainment. I might be a super hero as well.,Neutral
857," I love hero movies, do you have a favorite hero, mine is Spiderman or Peter Parker",Curious to dive deeper
857," Can I say that Robbie the robot from the original lost in space is my hero.  Always around and in the way. Danger Will robinson, Danger.",Neutral
857," That movie was pretty good, Lost in Space, it has a great cast including Molly Parker",Curious to dive deeper
857,Why is it you enjoy Peter Parker.  Most super heroes today are hapless everyman's who get special powers and use them for good.  Is there a wrong you need to right?,Curious to dive deeper
857,No I only think his powers are super cool did you watch Avengers Infinity War?,Curious to dive deeper
857," I admit, I have not seen Avengers Infinity War.  I did watch the Lost in Space Remake.  It was entertaining.  But it worried me the way they bounced from ridiculous danger to imminent peril to life threatening situation. It was a bit much.",Neutral
857," Would you recommend Lost in Space? whats it about just wondering, seems like a good movie",Curious to dive deeper
857," The family, the robinsons, are trying to get to a new planet.  They are colonists.  Stuff goes wrong. They crash on some unknown planet.  They survive.  It is not a movie, but a show with a number of episodes.  Intense action. Danger.  If the action of super hero movie is good four you, you will like.",Neutral
857," Sounds interesting, anyways do you subscribe to Netflix?",Curious to dive deeper
857," I do subscribe to Netflix.  I have made a note to look for ""Killing Eve""  The description of the show seems vague on what actually happens.  Spy thriller or what?",Curious to dive deeper
857," Its available in Netflix its a British series it seems, I haven seen that one before though, it looks interesting",Curious to dive deeper
857,Dark Humor sometimes appeals Sandra Oh might be nice as well.,Neutral
857," Im not really sure I like dark humor, but I try to keep an open mind about it",Curious to dive deeper
857," It kind of funny that Lou Ferrigno, the original TV hulk still does hulk voice.  Hulk smash.  All these characters were created in the 1930's.",Neutral
857," He does? thats really interesting, do you know Jarvis, Starks assistant?",Curious to dive deeper
857," No, Stark is Iron Man.  But Jarvis is not a character I know.",Neutral
857," Well Jarvis is his computer assistant and the person who does the voice of Jarvis had never seen an Avengers movie, I think thats funny.",Curious to dive deeper
857," Yes, if you do the work, you should at least see the end result.  Do you like shawarma?",Curious to dive deeper
857," I do yeah, one of my favorite foods why do you ask?",Curious to dive deeper
857," It is documented that shawarma sales go up because of avengers movies.  I like shawarma, but never thought to link the two.",Surprised
857," I guess its because of the ending scene, heroes gather at end at a Shawarma place, in fact im getting a but hungry not a bad idea, thanks for the chat I think im going to eat a Shawarma now,",Curious to dive deeper
857," I would not have known that unless I watched the movie, or had you to explain. Thanks.",Happy
857," Thank to you, I feel I have learn a lot of interesting facts, have a nice day, bye",Curious to dive deeper
858,I am a big fan of the Marvel comics! The Avengers is really great.,Happy
858," ya I agree, did you hear that due to the avengers there was an increase in shawarma sales haha!",Surprised
858," Oh awesome! Ha. It was shot with an imax camera, the entire movie! That's just one reason it was spectacular. Imax theater movies are amazing but sometimes make me dizzy.",Happy
858," ya sometimes it is too overwhelming, did you ever watch the show recess? the girl who voices gretchen voiced the waitress in the Avengers",Surprised
858," Yes, I loved Recess! I didn't know that, how cool! The Avengers- The Age of Ultron was the nineteenth film. ",Curious to dive deeper
858," ah interesting, did you watch the original incredible hulk from the 70s btw?",Surprised
858," Heck yeah, I was a big fan of the Hulk. I watched the show religiously every week! My cousin was related to the guy who played him but I cant remember his name.",Curious to dive deeper
858," haha ya his name was Lou Ferrigno, and he actually appeared in one of the avengers movies!",Surprised
858," Oh yeah, I sort of remember that. How cool! I am into reading the Marvel comics too and really enjoy all the characters and the themes. In 1998 marvel offered the rights to sony for all the characters for $25 million but they only wanted Spiderman for $10 million because they claimed thats the only one people would care about.",Curious to dive deeper
858,haha that's funny! did you know the guy who plays jarvis's voice? I guess he has never watched an avengers movie haha,Surprised
858," Noway, what a trip! How would you someone not watch their own work? I am big on watching them with Netflix. Netflix is fast and has super bandwidth.",Curious to dive deeper
858," oh definitely, didyou hear about how Netflix was started? like what inspired its creation?",Curious to dive deeper
858," No, I am not sure how they started. I do know I am one of 137 million total subscribers now.I can remember when they first started and we would order and mail the dvd's back and forth through the mail.",Surprised
858," haha ya I remember that, it makes sense they  switched to digital, I guess Netflix spends 20x more on postage than on the streaming bandwidth",Surprised
858," Man, thats a lot. I heard that the only places that don't have Netflix is North Korea, Syria and Crimea. That sounds about right when you think of North Korea and how oppressed they are.",Curious to dive deeper
858," ya, that would make sense, anyway the funny story on how netflix was started is the creator was charged a $40 late fee for Apollo 13, that is a good movie though!",Surprised
858," Oh wow, that is a funny story. I guess everyone in the world gets late fees, not just me! lol.",Happy
858," haha yes I haven't gotten a $40 late fee though, do you like Marvel or DC more btw?",Surprised
858," Oh man that is a hard question to answer. I don't think I can choose today. I like the characters that was created for kids with poor hearing though, I like the social aspect of Marvel Worldwide inc.",Happy
858," ya that is true, I like batman but besides him I only like Marvel, funny that there is one character shared by both Marvel and DC",Surprised
858," Oh cool, okay I really like Batman and Robin too. I never forget about the sidekick. Walt Disney acquired Marvel and he branding has just become a 2 billion dollar venture.",Happy
858," ya I remember that, it was back in 2009, seems like a while ago but it has definitely paid off!",Happy
859,hi how are you? do you use netflix?,Neutral
859," I do, what about you? ",Curious to dive deeper
859,I used to watch. i dont know. i cut the cord. LOL,Neutral
859," Interesting. I was thinking about it, but I still use it sometimes. ",Curious to dive deeper
859,I used to watch quite a bit and realized i needed to use my time better.,Neutral
859,That is a good point. What if you could be a paid tagger though?,Curious to dive deeper
859," I guess that job seems cool, but after a while, you get tired of watching tv and tagging. i would get bored.",Neutral
859," Yeah, I hear you. Did you know netflix monitors illegal downloads in Europe? ",Curious to dive deeper
859,I guess they want to see what people want to watch. netflix can plan then.,Neutral
859,Do you like Marvel Comics?,Curious to dive deeper
859,i dont read comics much. I sometimes see the movies though. not often.,Neutral
859,I see some of the movies too. I think some of them really can suck though too.,Curious to dive deeper
859," yeah, too many explosions and too many battles. i tire of the spectacle. i prefer story",Neutral
859," Me too, that is why I am more of a fan of thrillers. What about you? ",Curious to dive deeper
859," I prefer dramas and comedies. I figure that superhero films can be good, just too many are geared to kids.",Neutral
859," I like dramas. Comedies, only on rare occasions. ",Curious to dive deeper
859," comedy is tough, and many bad comedies are made. i like superhero films that are comedies though.",Neutral
859,So did you like Deadpool?,Curious to dive deeper
859," I did like Deadpool. only saw the first one, but i like that humor. less superhero stuff, more story and dialog. anyway, great chat!",Neutral
859,I only saw the first one too. Nice chatting with you!,Happy
859,You too! Have a great weekend!,Neutral
859,Take it easy!,Curious to dive deeper
860,Hello. Do you know a lot about Marvel?,Curious to dive deeper
860,Yes I think so. I love the movie infinity War. It was the first film ever to be shot entirely with digital IMAX cameras.,Happy
860,You can really tell. I love the attention ot detail they are putting into these movies. They are really diving into some great comics with all of this.,Happy
860,Yes I totally agree. For example they included the original Hulk actor in several appearances of the movies!,Surprised
860,I like Lou Ferrigno. He is totally iconic Hulk. I think they did an awesome job with all the cast really. I'm honestly trying to think of a better actor for Jarvis than Paul Bettany and I can't.,Happy
860,Yes I totally agree. Isn't it surprising that he has never seen the films?,Curious to dive deeper
860,I could see it though because if he wants to portray the character in a certain way watching an edited version might change that subtly and affect the quality of his work,Neutral
860,Yes I guess that's a very good point. Do you know why the avengers caused a notable increase in shawarma sales?,Curious to dive deeper
860,That is hilarious. I could totally see that too. There are so many funny memes about how the avengers are sitting in that schwarma restaurant and the workers are going about things like nothing happened.,Happy
860,Oh I see that explains it! Yes that was hilarious. I love having The Avengers on Netflix so I can watch at anytime. From 9pm to 12am Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in North America!,Happy
860,Wow that is a lot of streaming movies! Their original content is quite good too. I like what they have done with some of the marvel characters in their own series.,Surprised
860,Agreed. I wonder how they got the rights to make those films? Netflix apparently spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth.,Curious to dive deeper
860,I guess that makes sense. Postage is spendy. Late fees are too though which is how the whole idea of Netflix started. Some guy got a late fee and wasn't having that.,Neutral
860,Yeah definitely is. I used to hate late fees. So glad Reed Hastings found a way around them!,Happy
860,Me too! I can't believe how big Netflix has gotten. I bet blockbuster is kicking themselves they didn't take that deal to buy them for $50 million back in the day.,Neutral
860,Yes can you imagine a blockbuster bought them at that time? Netflix is now worth $2 billion.,Curious to dive deeper
860,I'm pretty sure blockbuster would still be around if that had happened. I'm glad that Hastings was smart and dropped the failing sales idea though. It would have been a shame if Netflix had went under because of it.,Happy
860,Yes I completely agree with you. And now look at them go. Netflix has 137 million total subscribers worldwide.,Happy
860,I was shocked to read that only about half of those were in the US. I would have totally though it was more considering it is a quarter of the internet traffic in north america.,Surprised
860," That really is amazing. But you're right they do have offices in the Netherlands, Brazil, India, Japan, and South Korea. A global market no doubt. It was great chatting with you today.",Curious to dive deeper
860,You as well. Have a great day!,Neutral
861,Have you ever seen the movie Cloverfield?,Curious to dive deeper
861,I have seen the movie Cloverfield which one is your favorite?,Curious to dive deeper
861," I liked the first one. I didn't know they had a series, is that available now? ",Curious to dive deeper
861,Yes there are a series of these movies. My favorite is 10 Cloverfield Lane. It has John Goodman and is really good,Happy
861," Yeah, I saw that one. Is there a 3rd? I was completely unaware!",Curious to dive deeper
861,Yes that is the third one. It's very different though because it does not have a big monster in it. I don't want to give away the ending but it is pretty crazy,Neutral
861,Interesting. I will check it out this weekend. I didn't think the second one was as good as the first to be honest.,Curious to dive deeper
861,I didn't see the second one actually but I would definitely recommend that you watch the third one it is really good,Neutral
861," Ok, the 2nd one they are trapped in one room the whole movie (it isn't that great). ",Curious to dive deeper
861,Ok haha. Do you have Netflix by the way?,Curious to dive deeper
861," No, I canceled my sub a while back. Did you know that Netflix and Youtube make up half of peak internet traffic in north america? ",Curious to dive deeper
861,Wow that is crazy. Also Netflix alone can take up about a third of all bandwidth in North America.,Surprised
861," Yeah, that is pretty crazy. Have you heard of the theory of only one electron in the universe? ",Curious to dive deeper
861,I have heard of that. I also heard of the one giant hologram Theory I think that Elon Musk believes in that,Surprised
861,Interesting. Did you know there are stars in the known universe that are cold enough to be touched by the human hand?,Surprised
861,Wow that is cool. Did you know that stars planets and gas clouds form about 6% of all matter?,Surprised
861,I can believe that. Have you heard of the natural selection theory of universes?,Curious to dive deeper
861,No I haven't. Can you tell me more about it?,Curious to dive deeper
861," Scientists theorize that universes evolve naturally, pretty crazy. ",Curious to dive deeper
861,Science is getting very fantastic these days! What about Netflix do you have a Netflix account?,Curious to dive deeper
861," I don't, I canceled it after I got hit with a LATE FEE! LOL",Angry
862," Hi, how are you today?",Neutral
862,hey I'm good what do you know about basketball?,Curious to dive deeper
862,I sometimes follow NBA ball. What about you?,Neutral
862," ya I like it, its made up of 30 teams and only 1 team is in canada",Surprised
862,Hockey and lacrosse are the official sports of Canada. There should be NBA teams in other big cities in Canada though.,Neutral
862," ya you'd think so, It's only the Toronto Raptors apparently",Neutral
862," How many players these days would shoot free throws granny style, do you think?",Curious to dive deeper
862," probably none, but I would! It's scientifically the best way to shoot!",Surprised
862," It would look silly, but Rick Barry used to shoot like that. If you had to choose, would you go to college or directly into the NBA?",Neutral
862," oh I'd go right to the NBA, I wouldn't do what tim duncan did and stay in college, you?",Curious to dive deeper
862," Too much money at stake, and people can go to college at any age. You can always get a degree, but NBA players are young.",Neutral
862," yup I agree, did you ever try on some air jordans?",Curious to dive deeper
862," No, never tried them. Stylish but expensive.",Neutral
862,ya I guess they were banned from the NBA but Nike kept paying the fee,Surprised
862," The fines would have been trivial for Nike, far less than the value of the publicity. ",Neutral
862," ya for sure, did you ever play chess?",Curious to dive deeper
862,Played a little many years ago. Not really my game. You?,Neutral
862," I used to be really good, its crazy it was invented in India and then perfected in Persia, its very old",Surprised
862," It's a cerebral game with fans all over the world. Well, I enjoyed chatting!",Happy
862,thanks you should check out books by judit polgar she's great at chess!,Happy
862,Will do. Ciao!,Happy
862,yup and just know there are more moves in chess than atoms in the galaxy!,Surprised
863," Parenting can be really hard, it requires a lot of hard work and patience.",Curious to dive deeper
863," Hi, how are you? I wouldn't want to be a solo parent. It sounds like a tough job to balance career and child-care.",Neutral
863," I know! it seems like a lot of suffering, kids can be difficult specially if you have more than one",Curious to dive deeper
863,It's important for kids to have good toys. Did you play with Lego as a child?,Curious to dive deeper
863," I did, I used to love legos, what about you?",Happy
863," I did, and I loved them. I like the company, too. Lego is investing millions to ditch their oil-based plastics in search of environmentally friendly alternative",Neutral
863," I think thats a great call, afterall they have the money and its better if they are environmentally responsible, Lego sure is a big and wealthy company.",Curious to dive deeper
863," In February 2015, Lego replaced Ferrari as Brand Finance's ""world's most powerful brand"". They've earned it! ",Neutral
863,I think this is because of the quality of their pieces out of 1000000 only 18 turn out to be deffective.,Curious to dive deeper
863," Customers pay a premium for quality. The company recognizes employee dedication. A 14 karat gold lego brick was given out in the early 80s to employees who had worked at the germany lego factory for over twenty-five years. they are valued at nearly $15,000.",Neutral
863," I see, that is really expensive I wouldnt pay that much for a lego brick, did you hear about that German Graffiti artist.",Curious to dive deeper
863," Oh, the guy who painted a 250 square meter bridge to make it look like it was made out of lego? Yeah, that's cool. A world of Lego! Could paint a whole neighborhood like that.",Neutral
863," I wonder if the bridge is still painted, that is pure art, I know I would keep it there. ",Curious to dive deeper
863,It would attract tourists and Lego fans. I assume there are many around the world. If all the Lego bricks produced were shared out equally every single person on earth would own 86 Lego bricks.,Neutral
863," I would like to take a photo next to that bridge, and that is amazing, there must be billions of lego bricks then, do you like reading?",Surprised
863," Yes, I enjoy reading. I don't get to the library much now though.",Neutral
863,Not enough time? there more libraries than McDonalds!,Curious to dive deeper
863," Mostly I go online for reading material. There are other things at libraries though. The Sacramento public library started a ""library of things"" ",Neutral
863," I wonder what the Sacremento library means but things, seems kind of random. ",Curious to dive deeper
863," Things like sewing machines and other items that patrons may find useful, but don't need to own long-term. Lending tools instead of books.",Neutral
863," I see well, I like old books from CS Lewis and Tolkien, I consider both as great authors.",Curious to dive deeper
864,Do you spend much time reading?,Curious to dive deeper
864," Yes I love to reading,  although lately ive been doing audio books because I have been busy. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
864,I adore reading. I think it is best way to travel to unknown worlds and escape reality for a little while.,Neutral
864,Yeah its great really expands your mind.  Did you know the world reacord speed reader reads at 4700 words per min,Curious to dive deeper
864,wow. I wonder if they actually retain anything at that point. Are you just flying past the words or do you absorb the story?,Curious to dive deeper
864," I have no clue,  I cant imagine they preocess everything they read at that point,  but I am not an expert. ",Curious to dive deeper
864,I would rather take my time and savor the classics like the works of lewis and tolkien.,Neutral
864," I wouldnt mind being able to read fast,  but I still want to absorb the information,  otherwise what is the point lol ",Curious to dive deeper
864,Yeah I mean yay you can ready fast but you are missing out on all the wonders that the library holds.,Neutral
864,Yeah exactly.  In the 18th century there was a moral panic because people were reading so many novel hahahahah,Curious to dive deeper
864,Wow i wonder what they would do if they read some of the things we have now like 50 shades of gray and twilight.,Neutral
864," Thats funny.  Twilight is a way better book in your imagination,  the movies were pretty horrible. ",Curious to dive deeper
864,I've never read the books. I saw the movies and that just ruined it for me. I heard the writing was rather bad in them though.,Neutral
864," It was simple,  nothing unique,  but I enjoyed it.  I wish I never seen the movies though.  Did you know if you publish a book in Norway the government will buy 1000 copies and distribute them to libraries?  ",Curious to dive deeper
864,That is pretty awesome. I think it is a great way to encourage budding writers. it is so hard to bet a book published in the us.,Neutral
864," Theres are more libraries than mc donalds in the US,  thats suprising,  mc donalds is everywhere lol ",Curious to dive deeper
864,That makes me happy. I think a lot of people in the world could use more libraries and more knowledge in their lives.,Neutral
864,Same.  I also read over half of adults have library cards!,Curious to dive deeper
864,I would think it would be higher than that. I don't think there is enough access to libraries for the people in certain areas of the us.,Sad
864,Yeah thats true.,Curious to dive deeper
864,It is so cool how some libraries are letting people check out other things than books. Like in sacramento where they can get sewing machines or tools.,Neutral
865,did you know that Spider-man has a hyphen in the name so that he wouldn't be confused with Superman by people that were reading quickly,Surprised
865," I didn't know that, crazy!",Surprised
865," ya that is wild, also Stan Lee's wife did voice acting for the 1994 Spider-man cartoon, I watched that as a kid, did you?",Surprised
865," I did actually, I thought the best spider man was Toby though. Not sure about this reboot. ",Curious to dive deeper
865," haha ya I didn't mind him, definitely better than the guy from The Social Network, I haven't seen the new movies, but it is wild to think that Capn Crunch's arch nemesis has battled Spiderman, now that is something I want to see in a movie haha",Curious to dive deeper
865,Is that who the new one is? Ughhh. Too many reboots these days.,Curious to dive deeper
865," Ya hollywood keeps making reboots I suppose because they are a safer investment than a new franchise, did you hear of the SpiderMan broadway musical? I never saw it but it was the most expensive broadway production in history",Surprised
865,I liked the batman reboots. I actually saw the musical when I lived in NY for spiderman.,Surprised
865,oh nice how was it? I wanted to see it but I think they stopped it at this point? I think they cancelled it soon after that one guy got injured and insurance was sued,Curious to dive deeper
865," It was great, my work actually gave us the tickets before it got canceled. ",Curious to dive deeper
865," well that's nice, do you play chess at all? I guess they did a study and there is no correlation between chess skill and iq level",Curious to dive deeper
865,I believe it. I'm not so sure the IQ tests are accurate to be honest.,Surprised
865," Ya I'm not sure I haven't taken one, but the president of the world chess Federation thinks that chess was invented by aliens, I don't know how high of an iq that guy could have if he believes that haha",Surprised
865," I haven't played much Chess to be honest, that sounds crazy that he believes that though. ",Surprised
865," ya I used to study it a little bit back in the day, what is crazy is there are more possible chess moves than there are atoms in the universe, that's a lot of permutations!",Surprised
865,really? I suppose that may be possible.,Surprised
865," what do you think of Judith Polgar? I remember I bought her chess book, anyway she beat a family friend at chess when she was only 5",Curious to dive deeper
865," That's insane, and apparently Chess was invented in india. ",Surprised
865," hmm I didn't know that, I did know it was modified by the Persians, my one friend is persian and he would always say that haha",Happy
865,I wonder if they hold special championships there because of that?,Curious to dive deeper
865," Oh I bet they do, he was very Pro-Persian so it wouldn't surprise me, all persians I have met have been very proud of their heritage",Happy
865," Interesting, I've never been to India, I bet it is pretty cool. ",Surprised
865," Ya I haven't either, I should go someday and play chess with those people!",Happy
866,Hi there! Are you a fan of Netflix?,Neutral
866,Not so much. I understand it has 137 million subscribers worldwide.,Curious to dive deeper
866," That's true, and almost 60 million of those are in the US. Hard to believe it's been around since '97, back in the Blockbuster days.",Neutral
866,Ha. I bet Blockbuster regrets buying Netflix. Now worth 2 billion dollars.,Curious to dive deeper
866,I know! They declined several offers of only $50 million. That pales in comparison is it's current Net Worth.,Neutral
866," Oops. So sorry, but you noticed that my keyboard did not include the word ""not"" as in ""not buying Netflix."" Sometimes my typing is lacking. Anyway, I remember going to Blockbuster for videos and DVD's. What an opportunity for Hastings and Randolph to jump on the enterprise.",Curious to dive deeper
866," Apparently, Hastings got the idea of starting Netflix after racking up a $40 late fee on Apollo 13.",Neutral
866," Can you imagine? I'm not surprised that it is not available in China, Syria, North Korea, and Crimea. I believe China won't allow the use of Google in the country. They are very closed to outside.",Curious to dive deeper
866," I suppose that makes sense considering the types of government in those areas, plus, Netflix still has offices in Brazil, India, Japan, and South Korea.",Neutral
866,I guess if possible it could be in outerspace. Ha. There is a vey large universe to expose to Netflix. Ha.,Curious to dive deeper
866," Haha, and isn't the Universe potentially just one giant hologram, man?",Neutral
866," Wow. I never thought of that possibility. I wonder who would have created that??? Hummmm? Man use to believe the earth was the center of the universe, but after scientific research, it was discovered that the sun is probably the center.",Curious to dive deeper
866," Haha, well, the sun is center of our solar system, not the Universe. The universe makes up a LOT of things.",Neutral
866," Oh, right. Thanks for correcting that. Don't know what my keyboard was thinking. I need a robot to do my typing.",Curious to dive deeper
866," Yeah, robots are capable of carrying out many complex actions.",Neutral
866,Can you imagine Michael Jackson wanted to build a moon walking robot that was 50-feet tall?,Curious to dive deeper
866,No more difficult to imagine than the robot which knows how to debone a chicken! Haha,Neutral
866,Crazy. Isn't it. Do you think someone will really create a human form robot?,Happy
866," I mean, robots can now be controlled by rat brains, so I don't see why not?",Neutral
866,A bit scary. Don't you think? It's good if they can be used by the military. It's always interesting to see the police use robots to enter possible bomb sites.,Curious to dive deeper
866," Yeah, it's a double-edged sword, for sure. They've saved millions of lives, I'm sure! Anyway, it's been nice chatting with you. Enjoy your day!",Neutral
867,Do you like to dance,Curious to dive deeper
867," Yes, I do you. Do you?",Curious to dive deeper
867,Only after a few drinks. I turn into a real michael jackson dancer lol,Curious to dive deeper
867,LOL I wonder if that is how Bruce Lee won the cha-cha championship in 1958?,Happy
867,I think so too! lol. I have a baby and she dances better than I can!,Curious to dive deeper
867,Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. Does yours?,Curious to dive deeper
867," she does so much, I just got a funny video last night of her doing it!",Curious to dive deeper
867,I'm sure you make lots of videos of her. The time goes by fast.,Happy
867," I do lol, so fast! Do you own fish at all or like to eat them?",Curious to dive deeper
867,I built a pond in my backyard. The birds seem to eat fish more than I do.,Curious to dive deeper
867," lol that is awesome and makes sense. Put a jelly fish there, one breed is immortal",Curious to dive deeper
867,I would be afraid of jelly fish in my pond.,Neutral
867," right me too, lol. Even black swallower fish, they can eat other fish that are much bigger, probably birds too",Curious to dive deeper
867,I definitely won't have them in my pond.  LOL,Happy
867," That is a good idea lol. Put seahorses in there though, those are always fun. They are the only fish with a neck",Curious to dive deeper
867,I love seahorses.They would be hard to see in my pond. I do have a water tower but I'm not sure if they would go in there.,Curious to dive deeper
867," I don't think so either. Speaking back to dancing, did you know tupac was a ballet dancer at one point?",Curious to dive deeper
867,I've read that...he was also in the Nutcracker.,Happy
867," That would be interesting to see, I may youtube it! It was so nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
867,It's been nice chatting with you. I'm sure it would be fun to watch.,Neutral
867,For sure! Enjoy your weekend!,Curious to dive deeper
868,Hi do you shop online?,Curious to dive deeper
868," Most of the time now, my favorite shop is amazon, and you?",Curious to dive deeper
868," Me too, it is so awesome. Do you ever shop the AMazonBasics line?",Curious to dive deeper
868,Yes they say the quality is not that great but I find them to be quite good,Curious to dive deeper
868,Yeah me too. Did you know Jeff built a clock on a mountain,Curious to dive deeper
868,Oh neat. They also created a new font just for kindle and similar devices called bookerly.,Curious to dive deeper
868,Neat. Yeah Jeff built it and it is supposed to run for a 10 000 years.,Curious to dive deeper
868,WOw that is too long. They also hold the patent on the 1-click buying,Curious to dive deeper
868,Wow they have done everything. Do you know how much the first customer spent?,Curious to dive deeper
868,I do not know that but I know that because of the patent Apple has to pay amazon to use the 1-click buying,Curious to dive deeper
868,Nice. The first customer got a building named after him after he spent less than $30,Curious to dive deeper
868,WOw nice. They also have a website where they sell the returned stuff discounted,Curious to dive deeper
868," Nice, that is a sweet deal. They deliver on Sundays too now because of a deal with USPS",Curious to dive deeper
868,THat is so convenient Do you know what the arrow in their logo represents?,Curious to dive deeper
868," Oh I do not know that actually, what is it there for?",Curious to dive deeper
868,Well it means that they offer everything from a to z,Curious to dive deeper
868,That makes sense. Their warehouse workers walk up to 15 miles,Curious to dive deeper
868,That is a lot. BestBuy and Target price match with Amazon,Curious to dive deeper
868,That is a sweet deal. ANd Amazon also owns IMDB since 1998,Curious to dive deeper
868,THey are everywhere really. DO you like robots?,Curious to dive deeper
868," I sure do, they are becoming part of our lives",Happy
869," Hello, do you like the Avengers?",Happy
869,My son likes it more than I do.  I like movies produced by Marvel Studios.,Curious to dive deeper
869,That's cool. Did you know that Marvel goes by Marvel Cinematic Universe too?,Happy
869," No, I did not.  Now I do.",Curious to dive deeper
869,Yep and the actor who voices jarvis has never seen the movies!,Happy
869," Really?  That was odd.  Apparently, Avengers:  Infinity War is the first film ever to be shot entirely with digital imax cameras.",Curious to dive deeper
869,That's cool and that the original Incredible Hulk actor has been the voice of the Hulk up to this day since the 70's!!,Happy
869," I like the Hulk. Lou Ferrigno deserves it.  When I am angry at work, I want to become the green giant.",Curious to dive deeper
869," Yeah hahaha oh wow, did you know that the Seahorse is the only fish to have  aneck?",Happy
869," I heard about it.  Apparently, there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.",Neutral
869,I dont doubt it i dont think they have a heart so...,Happy
869,I'm confused.  Who have no heart?,Curious to dive deeper
869,The Jellyfish,Happy
869,I wonder if scientists have studied their genes.  Some people want to be immortal.,Curious to dive deeper
869," Well, i think the best bet for that will be to look at the zebrafish more closely!",Happy
869,Please tell me about the zebrafish.,Curious to dive deeper
869,Well they 84 percent of the counterparts for human diseases,Happy
869,I see.  I'm amazed though.   We are so different from the zebrafish.,Surprised
869,Thats why alot of secrets lie in the genes,Happy
869," Apparently, the black swallower fish can eat prey twice its own length and ten times its weight.  That is odd.  I do not want to be near that fish. ",Curious to dive deeper
869,Maybe thats how it got its name haha,Happy
869," There are so many interesting facts about fish.  I wish I could chat longer.  However, it is getting late.  I would like to say good night and it was truly nice chatting with you.",Happy
870,Hey how are you? Do you like shopping on Amazon?,Curious to dive deeper
870,I do.  I find that it has a lot of what I need and a lot of variety as well,Happy
870," I agree, you can find all kinds of stuff on there. It's the largest internet retailer in the world!",Surprised
870,And it will only get bigger.  It has thousands of items from every category one can think of,Curious to dive deeper
870," Yep, did you know that Jeff Bezos actually built a clock into a mountain?",Surprised
870,Sounds like he is using that Amazon stock money to good use then.  I can imagine how big his house might be,Surprised
870," The clock should run for 10,000 apparently. I bet his house is huge!",Surprised
870,Not as big as an Amazon warehouse though.  Workers walk 7-15 miles a day during their shift,Surprised
870,That's alot of walking there! I thought my 4 miles per shift was alot.,Surprised
870,I figured Amazon a lot of robot helpers in the warehouse to take some of the heavy load.  Since robots are becoming more and more useful in work life,Curious to dive deeper
870," I think they're starting to incorporate them, but there is some things that humans just do better. Did you know that the first Amazon customer spent $27.95 and got a building named after him?",Curious to dive deeper
870," Wow, and I have spent thousands over the years and all I get is free shipping!",Surprised
870," I agree, I guess we just weren't early enough. ",Surprised
870,I did not know originally that AMazon owns IMDB.  No wonder their movies do well with Critics,Surprised
870,I didn't know that either. I like Amazon Prime video though.,Curious to dive deeper
870,They do have some good TV and movies on their service.  I suppose one could buy only from Amazon for everything and probably be ok.,Surprised
870," Probably so, between them and Wal-Mart I'm set. ",Curious to dive deeper
870," I shop at walmart too, but it is always so busy.  The great thing about amazon is it just shows up at my house.  Even on Sundays",Happy
870," I love getting my Amazon packages on Sundays. I started doing the grocery pickup at Wal-Mart, and I'll do instore pickups so I don't have to really go inside or deal with the registers.",Curious to dive deeper
870,That makes sense.  And of course you can still get things shipped from walmart to your home.,Happy
870," Yep, I believe they're trying to keep up with Amazon. Well I hope you have a great day. It was nice chatting with you. ",Happy
871," Hai,Have you purchased on the amazon?",Happy
871,I have purchased on the amazon. Have you?,Happy
871," yes,Do you think the service will be useful for you on the website",Happy
871,It has been reaaly helpful in buying hard to find items or everyday items I do not want to go out and buy. Do you enjoy the amazon?,Curious to dive deeper
871," yes i like very much,Buying things as it is at home is useful",Happy
871,What's been your best purchase?,Curious to dive deeper
871,mobile phone and LED TV.,Happy
871," Nice. Did you buy a clock you could build into a mountain that could last for 10,000 years?",Curious to dive deeper
871,sorry I'm not sure do you can,Happy
871," Oh, Jeff Bezos bought one so I thought they were available on Amazon. I wonder how big it is.",Neutral
871," okay,What do you think about the robot?",Happy
871," I like robots. Do you think they will take over the world though? I am worried about it, a lot!",Neutral
871," Of course, I have that sadness but do you think it's possible",Happy
871,I am not sure but I have seen what Boston Dynamics can do with their AI and robots and they have some evolving robots!,Curious to dive deeper
871," yes definitely,do you like horror film?",Happy
871,Not really. I get too scared and leave the theater or turn it off. Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
871,i like so much horror film and very interesting story.,Happy
871,Nice. What's your favorite horror film,Curious to dive deeper
871,Insidious: The Last Key this film is my favorite.,Happy
871," I have never heard of it. It's a horror film? I will have to check it out, if Im not too scared. ",Curious to dive deeper
871,okay.,Happy
872,Hello - how are you today?,Curious to dive deeper
872," Hi, well. How are you doing? Are you a robot? ",Curious to dive deeper
872,I am doing good and no I am not a robot. Did you know from 9pm to 12am Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in North America?,Surprised
872,That's pretty crazy.  Netflix apparently really has a thing for Cloverfield doesn't it?,Curious to dive deeper
872,Netflix is pretty successful. I saw that them and YouTube make up about half of the peak internet traffic in North America.,Surprised
872,I'd like to see more robot movies. Maybe Netflix can work on that. I think they could explore Megatron's background more.,Curious to dive deeper
872,I saw that Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth.,Surprised
872,Yeah I guess they still send out DVDs. That's a lot of postage.,Neutral
872,That's a lot of postage!,Happy
872,Netflix has over 150 movies with 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. I wonder how many of those I've seen?,Curious to dive deeper
872,Wow that's crazy,Surprised
872,I jumped on the Netflix streaming bandwagon in 2007 when they started. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
872,I just recently got Netflix because it was bundled in my with T Mobile account. I watch it periodically.,Happy
872,I think a fun job would be one of the people that watches Netflix movies and shows and tags them for subjects and indexing. Paid to binge watch!,Happy
872,That would be a very fun job. Wonder how much it pays? Netflix is worth $2 billion now.,Surprised
872,And 58 million subscribers in the US alone. That's like 1/6th the population.,Surprised
872,yea that's a lot!,Surprised
872,They're pretty smart too. They monitor illegal downloads to get a feel for what shows to stream.,Neutral
872,Yep I've heard that they do that too.,Happy
872," I'd like them to adapt some Isaac Asimov. He invented the word ""robotics"" actually.",Curious to dive deeper
872,It was great talking to you!,Happy
873," do you like horror films? I guess Stephen King considers Bambi to be a horror movie, I never would have guessed that!",Surprised
873," Hello there, really? I wonder why he would have ever said that.  ",Curious to dive deeper
873," ya, have you seen it? Like it's sad but not a horror movie to me, more like a sad one though haha",Curious to dive deeper
873,I think I have but when I was really young.  Do you know how they make the majority of metallic noises in horror movies?,Curious to dive deeper
873,haha no I don't how do they do it? some kind of weird instrument?,Curious to dive deeper
873,Yeah I guess it is called a waterphone.  Sounds like a pretty crazy instrument to me.,Curious to dive deeper
873," ya I need to look up what that sounds like, also I shoudl watch more horror movies apparently you can burn almost 200 calores from watching one, that would help me lose weight!",Surprised
873,Yeah I guess they must get your heart racing pretty fast!  What are some of your horror favorites?,Curious to dive deeper
873," Well I like The Shining, I like Nightmare on Elm Street, and Halloween is a classic, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
873," Yeah good call, the Shining is one of the best ever.  Halloween is a good one too and so is Nightmare.  I really like Rosemary's Baby, have you seen that one?",Curious to dive deeper
873," no I haven't, what is that about? I have heard of it but I haven't seen it yet",Curious to dive deeper
873," It is really good, it is about a wife who gets set up by her husband and she gives birth to the devil basically.  ",Curious to dive deeper
873," haha oh wow, well you like the shinning, its good to know that Danny from the movie didn't realize he was making a horror movie at the time, that could have scarred him for life!",Happy
873,Yeah I think that is pretty funny though.  I wonder what kind of movie he thought he was gettin into?,Curious to dive deeper
873,haha ya I wonder if they shot the scenes out of order or told him lies to keep it so he didn't know what he was diong haha,Curious to dive deeper
873," Yeah I think you might be right about that. On a different note, are you a user of Amazon?",Curious to dive deeper
873," ya I like to buy stuff from there, I don't have prime anymore i didn't use it enough, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
873," Yeah I use them quite often, especially around the holidays.  Do you know what the first ever amazon purchase was?",Curious to dive deeper
873," no I don't! I do know the guy would bought the first item got a building named after him though, what was it?",Curious to dive deeper
873,Yeah good call! I guess he paid $27.95 and got a building named after him yeah.,Curious to dive deeper
873," I mean it is cool to get a building named after you, but it would have been cooler to get something physical, really anything, instead of that haha but thats just me",Curious to dive deeper
874,Good day. Do you like netflix?,Happy
874," I used to, no longer have a subscription. ",Curious to dive deeper
874,Did you know that netflix was founded by reed hastings and marc randolph in 1997?,Happy
874," I did know that, he is still the CEO. He was just on CNBC. ",Curious to dive deeper
874,Ntflix has over 137 million subscribers worldwide. 58.46 million in the us alone.,Happy
874,WOW! That is a lot!,Curious to dive deeper
874,That really is a lot of subscribers. From 9pm to 12 am netflix accounts for 33% of the internet traffic in north america.,Happy
874,I can believe it. I canceled my subscription because I wasn't watching it enough.,Curious to dive deeper
874,All in all Netflix and youtube together make up half of the peak internet traffic.,Neutral
874," Yeah, that is true. What do you know about the universe? ",Curious to dive deeper
874,I know that it is all of space and time and all of their contents. So basically everything.,Happy
874,Interesting. Did you know the universe may exist inside a black hole?,Curious to dive deeper
874,Yeah I heard that. So do you think that the Universe evolved thropugh natural selection like humans have?,Happy
874," It could be true. To be honest, nobody really knows. ",Curious to dive deeper
874,I think it is. I mean its just a bunch of rocks floating through space. The bigger ones are going to encapsulate the smaller ones over time.,Happy
874," Yeah, that is true. What do you know about robots? ",Curious to dive deeper
874,I heard that Michael jackson had planned to build a 50 ft robot to moonwalk the deserts of las vegas.,Happy
874," OMG, that's hilarious. Who actually knows what that guy was thinking. ",Curious to dive deeper
874,This is kind of scary to me. I guess they can use a rats brain to control a robot. It wont be long until they can do it with humans.,Happy
874," I wouldn't be surprised if they've already tried. Well, nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
874,It was a lovely chat. Have a wonderful day.,Neutral
875," hi there, do you watch the NBA?",Curious to dive deeper
875,Yes I do. Do you know who Reggie Miller is?,Curious to dive deeper
875,Yes the NBA player that was always beaten at the game by his sister,Curious to dive deeper
875," Yes the woman was a star, broke 8 national records once",Curious to dive deeper
875,Amazing. Do you like Iverson?,Curious to dive deeper
875," I do, he signed a killer deal with Rebook, $800 000 a year till he is 55",Curious to dive deeper
875,Yes and after that he gets $32 million.,Curious to dive deeper
875,Yeah sweet deal the guy is pretty much set for life now,Curious to dive deeper
875,Yeah. Do you ever practice the granny shot?,Curious to dive deeper
875,Yeah but players do not like it because it is funny. Do you play chess?,Curious to dive deeper
875," Sometimes, there are more positive moves than atoms alltogether in the universe",Curious to dive deeper
875,Wow nice. The president of the federation believes it is invented by aliens,Curious to dive deeper
875,Wow. Judit Polgar beat someone at it when she was only 5,Curious to dive deeper
875,Wow nice smart kid. The game was invented in India and not by aliens though,Curious to dive deeper
875,Haha yeah during the Gupta empire actually.,Curious to dive deeper
875,Yeah. DO you like SPiderman?,Curious to dive deeper
875,I love the movies. Do you know why it has a hyphen in the name?,Curious to dive deeper
875,Yes so it can be distinguished from Superman as they sound similar,Curious to dive deeper
875,Yeah. Stan Lee's wife did the voice for Madame Web in the early SPider-man series,Curious to dive deeper
875," Wow that is awesome, they were both into these kind of things.",Curious to dive deeper
875,So awesome. Spiderman is also the most expensive Broadway production,Curious to dive deeper
876,Hey there are you a spiderman fan? Or should I say spider-man...Stan Lee used the hyphen so people wouldn't confuse him with superman!,Curious to dive deeper
876,Spider man is a fictional super-hero created by Stan lee.  He has appeared in comic books.,Happy
876,Yes he is. More specifically he is the alias of Peter Parker who is an orphan because his parents were killed.,Neutral
876," He is lived with his uncle. Peter is very innocent boy,  He is character is designed with adolescence and financial problems.",Happy
876,Yes have you ever seen the Spiderman movie? The movie was created by Sony because they have the cinematic rights to Spiderman.,Curious to dive deeper
876,He appears in American comic books which are published by Marvel Comics. Spider man first appeared in 1960.,Happy
876,I thought he first appeared in the amazing fantasy number 15 which was published in August 1962. This was the silver age of comic books.,Curious to dive deeper
876,It is very interesting to know it. I think you read comic books. Who is your superhero ?,Surprised
876,I like Superman. But Spiderman is cool too. I would love to see the Broadway musical about Spiderman. It was the most expensive production in Broadway history.,Curious to dive deeper
876,Music also plays an important role in superhero movies.  Graphic designers have an important job too.,Happy
876,Yes you are right. Did you know Stan Lee's wife voiced Madame Web in the 1994 spiderman series?,Curious to dive deeper
876,Stan lee did not want people to confuse spider-man with superman. They're different movies. It is very tough for designers to make dresses- it requires a lot of effort.,Happy
876,Yes it does. Cap'n Crunch arch rivals sogmaster and the soggies exist in the marvel universe and have even battled spiderman! That is so funny.,Surprised
876," Stan lee is excellent writer also, he make the movie interesting. Which is your favourite sports ?",Happy
876," I love basketball and especially the NBA. It was founded in New York on June 6, 1946.",Curious to dive deeper
876," It is the famous US pastime. In the middle ages, large numbers of people played this game in towns and cities. It was quite popular.",Happy
876,Yes it is one of my favorites. The NBA banned air Jordans in the past but he wore them anyway because Nike paid the fines before each game.,Surprised
876," The league was found in June 6, 1946 as BAA. In the 1949, the league adopted it NBA, after merging with national basketball league.",Happy
876,Yes. One of my favorite players was Reggie Miller. But his sister was almost better than him. It was pleasant talking with you this morning.,Curious to dive deeper
876,Very nice chatting with you. Have great day.,Surprised
876,Bye now!,Neutral
877,Hi! Do you enjoy reading? I've been wanting to read Starship Troopers since it's the first Sci-Fi novel to make the reading lists of three US military branches! It must be great!,Curious to dive deeper
877," I love reading. I read starship troopers a long time ago. saw the movie too. Heinlein was in the military. the navy, i think.",Neutral
877,That's awesome! I'd also like to read Ender's Game as it's also suggested for military organizations even including the Marine corps!,Curious to dive deeper
877," i never saw the movie for that, but i did read the book. Orson Scott Card is a great writer. would you ride a reading bicycle?",Neutral
877," Ha! I don't know if I'd be able to. But what I do wish is that I could read 4,700 words per minute which is a world record set by Anne Jones. Wouldn't that be awesome?",Neutral
877," I guess, but how much does she retain? can she remember all that info? we should give her a test a week later.",Neutral
877," That is a good point. She probably doesn't retain much. Ha! On a related reading note, I find it sad that there was a moral panic over the spread of the reading of novels back in the 18th Century. I'm so glad we don't love back in those times.",Sad
877," Yeah, poetry was considered the highest form of literature, and novels were vulgar, dealing with themes not suitable for civilized people.",Neutral
877," Such a shame! But to lighten things up, Tolkien and CS Lewis both held a you laugh, you lose  competition while reading horrible poetry. I think that's hilarious! Ha! I bet they had plenty of laughs too!",Happy
877,I would buy tickets to that event. it sounds great. those two were terrific authors.,Neutral
877," Indeed they were! Speaking of authors and books, do you like libraries? I'm glad to hear there are still more libraries than there are McDonald's here in the US and over half the adult population still has library cards! That gives me a little hope!",Happy
877," I am amazed by that fact. there is so much obesity in the US, i figure it would be the other way around. maybe we could combined libraries and fast food? LOL",Neutral
877," Hey, maybe so! It would be similar to the Sacramento library that started a library of things where they let you check out stuff you may need temporarily but don't want to own like sewing machines!",Neutral
877," the tool library is an awesome idea. many people dont have enough money for some basic tools. reduce, reuse recycle. it is a good system.",Neutral
877," That is a great idea, actually. I wonder if they sell tools at the ""library of things""? Speaking of libraries, I think it's nice that if you publish a book in Norway, the government there buys 1000 copies and distributes them to libraries across their country. I wish every government would do that!",Happy
877,I will move to Norway. I will write childrens books and become rich. that is now my plan. Yes!,Neutral
877," It's a great idea. We mentioned the library of things previously, but I wonder if they also rent out legos?   I love Legos! In fact, the German  Lego factory would give out a 14k gold Lego brick to employees who had worked there for 25 years back in the early 80s. I think that is awesome and it's too bad they still don't do that today!",Happy
877,I think that is great. I would love to work for Lego. I think the library just lends out tools for adults.,Neutral
877," Probably so! Well speaking of legos, did you ever hear about that German graffiti artist who painted a 250 square meter bridge to resemble a lego? That takes serious talent. Ha!",Neutral
877," That is a cool way to decorate the urban landscape ! Anyway, thanks for the chat!",Neutral
877," Agreed it is! But Legos are so popular now, as it has movies, amusement parks, games and competitions all under it's name brand. Well thanks for chatting with me as well. Hope you have a great day, friend!",Neutral
877," You, too! Have a great day.",Neutral
877,You have a great day as well! I'm off to read how Lego replaced Ferrari as the world's most powerful brand. Ha! Take care!,Neutral
878," How's it going, have you ever played with Legos? I never knew the company that owns them is from Denmark",Surprised
878," Yes, The cool thing is that Legos are too much fun. Lego pieces can be assembled and connected in many ways to construct objects including vehicles, buildings, and working robots.",Curious to dive deeper
878," Yea, they have been one of the best toys since Legos came out in 1949",Neutral
878," I agree and they also support movies, games, competitions as well as six Legoland amusement parks. These have all been developed under the Lego brand.",Curious to dive deeper
878,That's pretty cool. DId you know only 18 out of 10000000 lego bricks produced are defective?,Neutral
878," That's a great percentage of low defects.  To top that off, legos are so consistent that they allow these bricks manufactured today to interlock with the ones made back in 1958. ",Curious to dive deeper
878," That's pretty cool, they also treat their employees well, in the german lego factory some even got a 14 karat gold lego brick",Surprised
878,That is awesome.  Did you know that a German graffiti artist painted a 250 square meter bridge to make it look like it was made out of legos?,Curious to dive deeper
878," No but that sounds like a nice piece of art, I wonder if drivers were scared to drive on the lego looking bridge",Curious to dive deeper
878," I know, right?  Lego is now investing millions to ditch their oil-based plastics in search of an environmentally friendly alternative.",Curious to dive deeper
878," That's pretty cool, I wonder if their are any good lego books.",Curious to dive deeper
878,I'm not sure but if all the lego bricks produced were shared out equally every single person on earth would own 86 lego bricks.,Curious to dive deeper
878,Nice. Have you've ever read Starship Troopers? It's on the reading list of the US military,Curious to dive deeper
878," No, I haven't.  I do know that in the 18th century there was a ""moral panic"" because of the spread of the reading of novels.",Curious to dive deeper
878," I wonder what made people in the 18th century have a moral panic lol, maybe it was because most people couldn't read",Neutral
878," That could be. It's hard to say.  Do you like the library?  Did you know that a library collection includes not only books but periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, films, maps, prints, documents, microfilmn, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, Blu-rays, e-books, databases and other formats?",Curious to dive deeper
878," Yea, in Norway if you publish a book the government buys 1000 copies to put into the library",Neutral
878,That is great. Did you know that there are more libraries than McDonalds in the US and over half of all adults have a library card?,Curious to dive deeper
878,Lol no but it's good to know theres more libraries than McDonalds,Neutral
878," I was surprised at that myself. Did you know that a man falsely imprisoned for 10 years spent most of his time at the library to study law and prove his innocence, and then became a lawyer to help free other people who have been falsely convicted?",Curious to dive deeper
878," Nope, glad he got out. Well it was nice chatting with you",Neutral
879,Memes like the cursed sarcophagus are really odd.,Surprised
879,What makes you say that?,Curious to dive deeper
879,I think the fact something based in fact iike archaeologists discoveries can quickly become an obsession.,Sad
879,I thought it started with finding three skeletons in one sarcophagus,Curious to dive deeper
879," It did, but archaeologists found the skeletons and a mysterious liquid.",Surprised
879,Some believe the liquid to be an energy drink and some believe it to be vaping juice.,Neutral
879,Somebody even jokingly called it sauce and called for baking a fused ziti.,Surprised
879,I would have preferred to sign the petition for the energy drink.,Neutral
879," Perhaps, but this takes me back to silly memes and a 4.5 billion year old planet.",Sad
879,We have enough energy from the sun to keep the planet running for hundreds of thousands of years,Neutral
879," True, but More than 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed",Angry
879,Thankfully we have plenty of water in reserve so as long as we don't pollute it,Neutral
879," In september of 2010, the united nations appointed official ambassador to extraterrestrials - perhaps they can help with that!",Sad
879,I find that a bit odd and haven't been able to verify that fact. Its like the UN having an amabassador for the sarcophagus too,Neutral
879," I'd like to see someone post a video on the second largest search engine, YouTube about that!",Surprised
879,I might start my own channel on YouTube dedicated to the sarcophagus findings,Neutral
879," Good luck with that, just don't repost Justin bieber's ""baby"" - it is the most disliked video on youtube",Neutral
879,I hate that video too...I might make a parody of it instead.,Disgusted
879," I would try and get it on someplace other than Pandora radio, so the rest of the world can hear it.",Angry
879," Pandora is relatively new, started in 2017 so I am not sure I will have enough followers on Pandora versus YOuTube",Neutral
879," True, although Pandora now streams comedy, so that might help!",Happy
880,Hello there. How great is the planet we live on? It was formed 4.5 billion years ago.,Curious to dive deeper
880,Good morning!  It is great I agree.  I think it's amazing that over 70% of it is covered in water.,Neutral
880," Yes I love water. Most of the water is from oceans but some of it is from lakes, rivers, and other sources.",Curious to dive deeper
880,I do too.  Have you heard about the forests being destroyed?,Neutral
880,Yes I can't believe more than 80% of the earth's natural forests have been destroyed.,Sad
880,I know.  I can't help but wonder what that is going to mean for the planet in the long run.  Will it have an effect on the earth's polar regions which are covered in ice?,Neutral
880," Yes I think it will and already has. Also, earth will be virtually Helium free by the end of the twenty first Century.",Surprised
880," That's an interesting thought. Helium has to be used for more than just blowing up balloons so that will change things I guess.  Also, everything natural with the planet is probably important in some way to it so things will change planet wise too.",Neutral
880,Yes I completely agree. And in the big scheme of things the lives of humans is so small relative to the earth.,Curious to dive deeper
880,Very true.  I've heard that if earth's history was viewed as a day we would only be just over a minute of it.,Neutral
880,Yes I can't believe it. I think it's fascinating that the earth's interior has a solid inner core and the liquid outer core that generate's a magnetic field.,Surprised
880,That is interesting.  Do you find it interesting also how the earth and moon interact?,Neutral
880,Oh yes definitely. Thanks for that interaction we get our ocean tides. I am sure the surfers are grateful as well!,Happy
880,True!  Isn't it amazing how everything works and such?  Without the moon the planet would rotate a great deal faster too.  Imagine what that would be like.,Neutral
880,Yes who knows what it would be like. There definitely wouldn't be a YouTube. Google actually bought youtube back in 2006.,Curious to dive deeper
880," Youtube must have had rapid growth in it's first year because it was just created in 2005 and then like you said, Google buys it the next year.",Neutral
880,Yes and for a big sum of 1.65 billion dollars. They really cashed out!,Neutral
880,They really did!  Did you know it's the second largest search engine on the net?,Neutral
880,I actually didn't realize that. Justin Bieber's Baby is the most disliked video on the site. People must be jealous. Well it was lovely chatting with you this morning.,Curious to dive deeper
880,People are also busy watching.  Youtube combined with Netflix makes up half of peak internet traffic in the country.  It's been nice chatting with you as well!,Neutral
880,Police also have their own called blutube! Have a good day!,Surprised
881,hi how are you? are you good over there today on the other side of the internet? things are pretty good here.,Neutral
881,Its pretty good.  Did you watch the Oscars the other night?  That is always a fun show,Curious to dive deeper
881," i did not watch the oscars. normally the show is boring (well, to me). a bit slow. i check the next day to see who won. ",Neutral
881,Did you know that Daniel Day-Lewis is the only actor to win best actor 3 times?,Curious to dive deeper
881,he deserves it. the man is a genius. MY LEFT FOOT. amazing performance. tom hanks won tice.,Neutral
881,Blazing Saddles was even nominated for 3 oscars - great flick!,Neutral
881,that was an AWESOME flick. could not be made these days. too much language. maybe as a south park episode.,Neutral
881,Though tamer flicks are still popular - Walt Disney won 22 oscars,Curious to dive deeper
881,Uncle Walt knew how to please an audience.quality was always there. quality always lasts.,Neutral
881," Yes for sure - though somehow enimen has more oscars than decaprio, depp, will smith, george lucas and bill murray combined.  How the heck did that happen?",Curious to dive deeper
881," eminem is pretty cool, but really the oscars seem too political. i figure they dole out favors to their favorites. ",Neutral
881,Maybe - but oddly enough the Oscars was nominated for  9 emmys in 2013!,Curious to dive deeper
881,i dont understand myself. the show is a bit slow for my taste. i figure that they are doing each other favors or something?,Neutral
881,I don't know.  Do you like basketball?  College basketball tends to go at a faster pace,Curious to dive deeper
881,the college game is for fun. i think the kids want to play their hearts out. the pros have other plans.,Neutral
881,That is for sure although Kareem Abdul Jabbar got the dunk banned in college basketball for over 10 years,Curious to dive deeper
881,They had it in for the man. he was too good. and he was changing the game without the permission of the forces that be.,Neutral
881,Yes.  I am not sure the coaches deserve that much pay however - in 39 states a football or basketball coach makes the most money,Curious to dive deeper
881," the coaches are not the most important, but they get paid the most. anyway, great chat there!",Neutral
881,Yes I would personally rather play basketball at the US supreme court,Curious to dive deeper
881,I would not. Have a great day!,Neutral
881,Yes but I would have a better chance of beating Ginsberg than Jordan!,Happy
882,Hi! Are you a fan of Jordan Peele? I'm so glad he won an Oscar for Get Out. Thankfully he finished writing it after stopping 20 times!,Happy
882," Somewhat, Its good he didn't give up.  Glad he won the Oscar too! I'm not surprised Walt Disney holds the record for the most Oscars.",Surprised
882,I'm not surprised either honestly. Just as I wasn't too surprised to discover Daniel Day-Lewis is the only actor to win an Oscar for best actor three times!,Neutral
882,Oh I know. He's the best actor. All of his movies are great!!,Happy
882,So true! Were you also a fan of Blazing Saddles? It's crazy it was nominated for three Oscars! Now that surprised me. Ha!,Surprised
882," Yes, that's funny. I can remember it. Did you see Frozen? It was inspired by The Snow Queen.",Curious to dive deeper
882," That's interesting! I wasn't aware of that! I do know that Jennifer Lee, the writer and co-director, was the first Disney animation feature film female director and also the first female director whose movie made more than 1 billion at the box office. That was awesome and quite an accomplishment!",Happy
882," Agree, being the first female.Robert Lopez is one of twelve people to win an emmy, grammy, oscar and a tony!",Surprised
882," Wow! Now that's truly an accomplishment right there. Talk about a jack of all trades! And here I thought Eminem having more Oscars than Johnny Depp, Leo, Will Smith, Bill Murray and George Lucas combined was impressive, not as impressive as Robert Lopez's accomplishments. Ha!",Surprised
882,Do you watch basketball? I didn't know New Zealand had a team.,Surprised
882," I wasn't aware of that either. I do watch and enjoy basketball though. I do think it's crazy the highest paid employee in 39 of the 50 states are either college football or basketball coaches. That's kind of sad, really.",Sad
882," lol, I agree. James Naismith who invented basketball is the only losing coach at the University of Kansas.",Surprised
882," That's kind of ironic, isn't it? Did you know there's a basketball court on the top floor of the supreme court building which is called ""the highest court in the land""? Ha!",Neutral
882,Good name!! Great way to get exercise at work.,Curious to dive deeper
882,No kidding! Ha! But them there's athlete's like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar who got dunking banned from college basketball for over a decade. He must have been a monster dunker!,Surprised
882," lol, i agree to get banned.",Surprised
882," We talked about the Oscars earlier, did you also know that the Oscars themselves were nominated for 9 Emmys back in 2013?",Neutral
882," Yes, I saw that. How does that work?",Surprised
882," Good question. Ha! Since the Emmys are basically the Oscar equivalent for television and was modeled after the Oscars, it's a little strange!",Surprised
882,yeah! It doesn't make sense. lol Have a good night!! Good chat!,Happy
882," True. But as long as the Oscars keep awarding and nominating first time directors like Jordan Peele, then they deserve awards too I suppose. Crazy he's only the third first time director to have their directorial debuts appear in all three categories. Well it was great chatting with you as well. Have a great evening!",Happy
883," Hi there, do you watch the Academy Awards?",Curious to dive deeper
883," Occasionally.  I am not a fan of the political commentary, but I enjoy seeing the actors recognized for fine performances.",Happy
883,Nice. Did you ever watch Blazzing Saddles? It was nominated for three Oscars,Curious to dive deeper
883," Oh, yeah. Lilly von Shtoop is a fine actress... But I prefer the acting of legendary actor Daniel Day-Lewis, the only actor to win best actor 3 times",Happy
883,Yeah that is quite something for him. Funny enough Eminem has won more Oscars than Leo di Caprio,Curious to dive deeper
883," I would never have guessed that one. But I would have guessed that Walt Disney would be recognized, but 22 oscars? Unreal!",Happy
883,I know they guy has set the standard too high now. Even Oscars were nominated for 9 Emmys. Strange,Curious to dive deeper
883," And the Emmy for best Academy Awards show goes to...the Academy Awards. Accepting on behalf of the Academy, James Naismith, the inventor of the game of basketball, who also is the only losing coach in Univ of Kansas history!",Happy
883,Hhahaha that is so strange really. I guess it took a while to get the game going. Still those coaches are the highest paid state employees,Curious to dive deeper
883," Yeah. Strange world we live in. One where New Zealand nicknames their basketball team, the Tall Blacks!",Happy
883,I wonder how that flies there really. Have you heard of the highest court on land?,Curious to dive deeper
883," Yes, the basketball court where Ruth Bader-Ginsberg dominates at the boards! ",Happy
883,I wonder how tall that building is really.  Do you ever watch animated movies?,Curious to dive deeper
883," Yes, I loved the film, Frozen. You?",Happy
883," Yes me too. ,It was the first DIsney movie to be written directed by a female",Curious to dive deeper
883," Yeah, and the first female to direct a feature film that earned more than $1 billion. Now that is shattering the glass(ice) ceiling!",Happy
883,What an achievement. Did you know Elsa was originally scripted to be the villain?,Curious to dive deeper
883," Ah, but with such a great song--Let it go--how could she remain a villian?",Happy
883,I know that is the only reason she was changed to a good character because the song was so uplifting,Curious to dive deeper
883," And to think, the movie Frozen was originally going to be called ""Snow Queen""  but the folks at Disney decided that feminine names are bad...",Happy
883," THat makes me sad honestly, that we judge based on that.",Happy
884,lets talk about earth. Its sad that More than 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed,Sad
884,Yes it could have happened during the  4.5 billion years of existing.,Curious to dive deeper
884,How did they know that a day was only 5.5 hours long ?,Curious to dive deeper
884,yeah thats When earth was first formed,Curious to dive deeper
884,Wow Earth will be virtually helium-free,Curious to dive deeper
884,By the end of this century. I wonder why .,Curious to dive deeper
884,the united nations  thinks that aliens will visit us,Curious to dive deeper
884,Yes they appointed  a official ambassador,Neutral
884,I love you tube. Youtube is the second largest search engine on the net.,Curious to dive deeper
884,Google bought the Good investment site in November 2006 for US$1.65 billion,Neutral
884," I have never seen Justin bieber's ""baby"" ",Curious to dive deeper
884,No one liked it lol,Surprised
884,Netflix and youtube eats up all the internet traffic in north america,Surprised
884,And most of it is in my house. I love Netflix and YouTube,Happy
884,I would like to check out blutube,Curious to dive deeper
884," Me too. Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim are genuineness ",Happy
884,You know I really dont like Pandora because of the freemium service platform,Angry
884,Its cool with me. Aloe blacc only received $12k in royalties from pandora for 168 million streams,Surprised
884,I do like the comedy,Happy
884,Yes the stand up is funny and has lots of good people,Happy
884,You are excellent. I will listen to pandora now,Happy
885,Hi! Are you into politics? Did you follow the interesting Senate race in Texas this year?,Curious to dive deeper
885," I've heard a litte, O'Rourke really gave Cruz a run for his money",Neutral
885," Yeah, I think it's because of his charisma, good timing, and viral videos of him defending progressive ideals and policies. Not sure what relentless shoe-leather politicking means though.",Curious to dive deeper
885,Yea I'm sure O'Rourke being an electric bassist in the 90s helped him seem more relatable,Neutral
885,Yeah! He even toured the US and Canada with his punk rock band!,Surprised
885," Yea, Ted Cruz seems out of touch, especially tweeting a photo of O'rourke from when he was in the band",Neutral
885," Wonder if that was a tactic he used to bash each other. It's too bad that despite his progressive views, young people vote at significantly lower rates that older voters and in Texas that could be a bad thing for O'Rourke",Surprised
885," Yea, apparently baby boomers don't like rock music or long hair",Neutral
885," Maybe they like beards, because every US president with a beard has been a republican.",Surprised
885," Yea and since 1928 every republican ticket has had a Bush or it too, or a Nixon",Neutral
885," Oh wow, that is true! Maybe the next election would break the record that there hasn't been a US president who wasn't a Republican or Democrat since 1800s",Surprised
885," Yea, the US needs more colors than just red and blue",Neutral
885," Or different animals, do you know what other parties representative colors and animals are?",Curious to dive deeper
885,I know Democrats are an ass and the Republican are elephants for some reason. Apparently Harry Truman didn't want to be photographed riding dumbo because he was an elephant,Neutral
885," I would vote for him, he's loyal to his party! Are presidents a form of celebrity because if they are, they get to visit Pixar studios which has a secret room that is often visited by celebrities.",Curious to dive deeper
885," I would suppose so, celebrity or not I think the president can visit Pixar's secret room",Neutral
885," Yeah, does that mean secret service agents can go in as well? ",Curious to dive deeper
885," I suppose. I wonder if Judge Judy has a secret room, she can afford one making 123,000 an episode",Curious to dive deeper
885," I can't believe she's the highest paid celebrity after Lebron James, I remember reading somewhere that the main character on the show House made the most",Surprised
885," Yea, I wonder if she's a republican or a democrat that supports social programs, labor unions, and universal healthcare",Curious to dive deeper
885," Seeing that she deals with certain issues, she may be a Democrat but not sure. I sure am learning more about history or politics than I ever did in school.",Happy
885," Yea plus I learned Fox news threatened to sue the simpsons, how ironic",Surprised
885,Oh really? How come?,Curious to dive deeper
885,For parodying fox-news anti-democratic agenda. Well it was nice talking with you,Neutral
886,Have you heard about some politicians who actually get along????,Surprised
886,I don't hear about it often! How about you?,Disgusted
886,There were two in Maryland named Baker and Legett who worked for years together and left as great friends,Curious to dive deeper
886,I read a little on that too! It sounds like they started out as professor and student- did you read the same?,Curious to dive deeper
886,Is that what happened? I wasn't quite sure.,Curious to dive deeper
886,Yeah I guess Baker was a law student at Howard and Leggett was the dean who pushed him to finish school. Cool story! I don't feel like I don't hear happy political stories often enough haha,Happy
886,That's the truth! It sounds like toward the end they both had a lot of personal things that pushed them to leave.,Sad
886,Did they? I didn't read that part. Does it sound like they were still on good terms when they left? I couldn't tell!,Curious to dive deeper
886," They were, but aparently one of the spouses had alzheimer's and the other lost his father in that last year.",Sad
886," Oh wow. That's rough. On a happier note, I was reading some interesting trivia-type facts on elections. Did you know since 1900, the taller presidential candidate has won the election 75% of the time?",Sad
886,Thats cool! Interestingly less than 63% of people have turned out for elections in the last 100 years,Curious to dive deeper
886," That's crazy! I know not everyone votes, but thats a pretty low number. Did you know officials in ancient Athens were chosen via lottery because they wanted to avoid a potential oligarchy? Apparently they thought thats what voting would lead to",Happy
886,Lottery! I guess then there is a chance everyone could be in charge. In nevada you can vote for none of the above!,Curious to dive deeper
886,I read that too! I wonder what would happen if everyone selected that. I guess its only one state in a presidential election so maybe it wouldn't be noticeable.,Surprised
886,I may move there and try it out next time! Hopefully they don't block poll observers like was done in 2012,Disgusted
886,Yeah that option might have come in handy for the last election! I wonder if they give the same option for smaller/local elections?,Happy
886,My favorite album was written and released by Pink Floyd in 1973 but still a best seller in 2014,Happy
886,Yeah! I love Dark Side of the Moon! Not surprising its still relevant. Did you know Straight Outta Compton was the first album to go platinum without touring or airplay?,Surprised
886,I didn't! that is awesome!,Curious to dive deeper
886," Speaking of rap, apparently there were two 100 year old twins who released a rap album together in 1992...probably didn't go platinum but kind of a funny fact!",Happy
886,Have a great afternoon,Happy
887,Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;),Happy
887," Hello, looking forward to it as well.",Curious to dive deeper
887,By any chance You're Linking Park's fan ?,Curious to dive deeper
887,I do like Linkin Park may favorite CD was hybrid theory. what about you?,Curious to dive deeper
887," I like a song or two - yeah -  ""hybrid theory"" is the best-selling album of the 21st century - pretty amazing. Do You have a favorite song ?",Curious to dive deeper
887,My favorite on that album is In the End.,Curious to dive deeper
887,YES ;) mine too. That vocal was amazing ! ;)  was... such a shame...,Sad
887,It is really too bad. What other music do you like?,Neutral
887," Mostly classic rock, blues. Some metal or Celtic folk - how about You ?",Curious to dive deeper
887," I have a pretty diverse taste in music. Rap, R & B, Classic Rock, pop ect. I was really into rap as kid did you know the Nwa's straight outta compton was the first album to reach platinum status without the suppor airplay.",Curious to dive deeper
887," Naah man, I didn't know that ;) I never liked rap - no offense, I didn't find it... well - musical enough ;)",Curious to dive deeper
887,TO each their own. I got into it because I liked Tupac and his lyrics and poems. There where two identical twins from Japan that made an album at the age of 100.,Neutral
887," I will never understand that ;) ( the ""Tupac"" thing )  - 100 years and they made an album ? music album ? Do You know what kind of music ?",Curious to dive deeper
887,It was a rap album!,Surprised
887,of course it was... ;) lol,Curious to dive deeper
887,Lol. Foreign rap is not my cup of tea but good for them. Did you know that Darkside of the moon is still one of the best selling albums even being 40 years old?,Surprised
887,Thank God we're talking about music finally ;) Well I'm not surprised it's a great album and after all those years I still can't get enough of it - I just bought a vinyl like 2 weeks ago... do You like Pink Floyd ?,Happy
887,I do I am pretty eclectic. What is your favorite song?,Curious to dive deeper
887," from that album ? I think ""Breathe"" and ""Time""  I do love The Division Bell and ""High Hopes"" on that album. Plus entire ""The Wall"" ;) what's Yours ?",Curious to dive deeper
887,From darkside of the moon I would agree with breathe and over all Pink Floyd song Idk there are so many to pick just one,Curious to dive deeper
887," You are absolutely right my friend ;) I hope Roger Waters will do another tour in US, I want to see him again ;)",Curious to dive deeper
887,That would be awesome. What other music do you like?,Curious to dive deeper
887," I love Joe Bonamassa, Nirvana, Dire Straits, Metallica, -recently I've discovered Black Country Communion and Kingdom Come ;) and if You like something really peaceful I recommend Loreena McKennit ;)",Happy
887," I think it is interesting how people can vary so much. Even with my kids. My oldest likes rap and pop, my youngest likes pop and my 4 year old likes rock and classic rock. ",Happy
887," oh good for them :) my daughter when she was like 1, she was always falling asleep to Metallica ;) it was her lullaby :)",Happy
887," Nice, he is like rock radar. He always finds good music on the radio. The other two just want to listen to uptown funk on repeat",Neutral
887," that's ok, what's most important is that they like music - taste will probably change once or twice in their lives ;)",Happy
887,Agreed :),Neutral
887," Hey it was great chatting with You today, thank You ;)",Happy
887,You too!,Happy
888,hi how are you? Do you listen to albums these days?,Neutral
888," Hi, I'm good. Yes I listen to albums. Are you familiar with the Moody Blues?",Curious to dive deeper
888," Yes, i am! wow, that is going back a ways. what album?",Neutral
888,I go back a ways. The Dark Side of The Moon was one of the best selling albums of 2014.,Curious to dive deeper
888," Yes, it was a great album and continues to get new fans every year. Have you tried the dark side of oz, since you go back a ways?",Neutral
888," No, what is that?",Curious to dive deeper
888," Watch the Wizard of Oz. at a certain point in the film, turn on Dark side as the soundtrack.",Neutral
888," Okay I'll give that a try. Given how quickly we have gone from records, to tapes, to Cd's, how long do you think is will be before Cd's are obsolete?",Curious to dive deeper
888,No need for physical media soon. i figure people will not want to own stuff that takes up space.,Neutral
888,Exactly. But there are still people who think that 33's have a better sound. I'm not one of them. What do you think?,Curious to dive deeper
888,I do not see the value in old recordings on old media. they are warmer because of the high end roll off but i figure you can emulate that with software.,Neutral
888,I think so too. Are you old enough to remember 8 track tapes?,Curious to dive deeper
888,I do remember the 8 trax. i never owned one. i guess they sounded better? seems to be expensive but not that much better.,Neutral
888,No they didn't sound better. But at the time it was the first media that you could play in a car. We thought they were great. But they really sucked.,Curious to dive deeper
888," Yeah, people like convenience more than quality, i think. the walkman was convenient but the sound was limited.",Neutral
888," Yeah, I think they just didn't have enough power to generate good sound. But I think the ultimate is still the reel to reel if you don't mind the space they take up.",Curious to dive deeper
888," Wow, that is an expensive setup. I would rather have something convenient. i like sound, and appreciate good sound, but i dont have the money for the high end. LOL",Neutral
888,I don't either. But I think recording studios still make the initial recordings on these devices.,Curious to dive deeper
888," I thought things would be digital now for convenience. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
888,Yes. Thanks for the chat and have a good evening.,Curious to dive deeper
888,Have a good night!,Neutral
888,Thanks.,Curious to dive deeper
889,Do you have a favorite celebrity?,Curious to dive deeper
889," Do Youtube personalities that are famous count as a celebrity? If they do, I really like a dude named Michael Jones.",Curious to dive deeper
889," That is fine me with, I think celebrity is anyone famous to many people. What does Michael Jones do?",Curious to dive deeper
889," He works for a company called Roosterteeth, and to be fair they have made 2 movies which he was the main character of both.",Curious to dive deeper
889,interesting I will have to check it out. I wonder how much he makes for those. Judge Judy makes like 123000 per episode,Curious to dive deeper
889," Speaking of Judge Judy, did you know her bailiff Petri Hawkins-Byrd makes a million per year from that show, pretty crazy since he doesn't really do anything haha.",Curious to dive deeper
889," WHAT! i would love to do that and get paid that much to stand around and be in front of the camera, lol!",Curious to dive deeper
889,Yeah that is pretty crazy money for doing literally nothing lol. Did you know that robin Williams started the trend of celebrities doing voice overs for animation with his role in Aladdin?,Curious to dive deeper
889," I did not know that, I still don't get why celebrities need to be in animated films because of their voice, but it was awesome though ",Curious to dive deeper
889," For me it really depends on the voice, Robin Williams was almost made for animated voice acting just because of his range in doing different voices.",Curious to dive deeper
889," Yea lol, he was amazing, sad he is with us no longer! I wonder if he got to visit Pixar's secret room for celebrities",Curious to dive deeper
889," I am sure he did, as much animation work as he was doing. Did you know Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on Sesame Street?",Curious to dive deeper
889," Wow, I never knew that. I was just watching that with my daughter, it is all celebrities now!",Curious to dive deeper
889,Did you there has not been a US president that was not a republican or democrat since 1853? that just shows how strongly people believe in the two party system.,Curious to dive deeper
889," wow, I wonder who that president was, do you know? ",Curious to dive deeper
889," It was Millard Fillmore, he was part of a party called ""the Whig Party"".",Curious to dive deeper
889," lol, they need to bring the Whig Party back, I am all for that, lol! ",Curious to dive deeper
889," Yeah the two party system in my opinion is not working all that well anymore, every time a president is up for election it just turns into a slug fest and who can find the worst stuff out about the other and air it out in front of the world.",Curious to dive deeper
889," Right, I am interested to see how the debates go this time, Trump can't just bully them this time. It was so nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
889,I am hoping he does not get away with his shenanigans again this coming year as well. It has been a nice chat.,Curious to dive deeper
889,Have a great weekend!,Curious to dive deeper
890,Do you know anything about,Happy
890,About what?,Neutral
890," Sorry, Beto O'Rourke.    I've been reading about him.",Happy
890,Is he a republican?,Neutral
890," No, I believe he was running as a Democrat.",Happy
890,So what have you been reading about him?,Curious to dive deeper
890,I read an article about why he supports National Football League players.,Happy
890,What is the reason?,Neutral
890,I would guess that he appreciates anyone expressing political opinions.,Happy
890,The NFL players were protesting police brutality right?,Neutral
890," I believe so, but the specifics do not matter so much.     Beto O'Rourke appeals to young people.",Happy
890,How so?,Curious to dive deeper
890," Well, younger people tend to vote away from what they perceive as the ""get off my lawn"" candidate.",Happy
890,Is it because younger people can't stand the gop?,Neutral
890,I do not know.    It is ironic that the GOP started as the party of classic liberalism.,Surprised
890,What do you think about the republican party as a whole?,Neutral
890,I find it interesting that every president with a Beard has been a republican.,Surprised
890," What a coincidence. Another coincidence may be that since wwii, the us economy consistently performs under democratic presidents",Neutral
890," Perhaps the country could elect someone from a third party, breaking the nearly 170-year string.",Happy
890," I believe Roosevelt came incredibly close as a 3rd party, but stopped just short",Neutral
890," I wonder if Roosevelt could have gotten into the celebrity room at Pixar, had the studio existed.",Happy
890," Perhaps, afterall, if I was Pixar, it would be an honor to have roosevelt visit. In any case, thank you for the enjoyable chat.",Neutral
891," Hello, do you like music albums?",Curious to dive deeper
891,I do. Did you know that Bob Marley has been on the album chart for over 914 weeks?,Curious to dive deeper
891,Wow I did not know that. Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory album is the best selling album of the 21st century.,Surprised
891,Now that is hard to believe! If you're looking for a non-censored album at Walmart you won't find it. They only sell clean versions of albums and if an artist refuses to make a clean version they will not sell it.,Happy
891,That's interesting! Reel Big Fish re-recorded all of their albums after losing rights to their old record label.,Surprised
891,Funny that they could get away with it. Good for them!,Surprised
891,I agree. Two identical twins in Japan released a rap album when they turned 100 years old.,Surprised
891," Oh, I can't imagine what that sounds like! I find it funny that Led Zeppelin decided not to title their fourth album, to confuse the hated rack press. ",Surprised
891,I think that's funny as well. Do you know much about elections?,Curious to dive deeper
891," I do! I love the election season. I'm not sure of the year, but a cat named Hank placed third in the VA senate election. I would have liked to see the reaction to that!",Curious to dive deeper
891,Me too. That would be very cool to see.,Surprised
891,I agree and I'm sure it was a good laugh. Did you know that all elections in Oregon are conducted by mail? I like going to the polls!,Sad
891,I did not know that. I love going to the polls as well.,Surprised
891,I'm surprised that  the 2012 US election was the first US election since 1944 in which neither major party ticket had a veteran on it. Kinda sad if you ask me.,Sad
891,Very sad. Officials in ancient Athens were appointed by lottery.,Surprised
891,Now that method sounds pretty scary. That's a big gamble! Psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections. I'd like to see the study on the lottery for elections!,Surprised
891," I think so too. Since 1900, the taller candidate for the president usually wins by about 75% of the time.",Surprised
891," Wow. That's a big advantage. A win based on no qualifications, just a physical measure! It compares to the fact that the fastest blinker in the Presidential debates has lost every election since 1980!",Surprised
891,I agree. Do you know much about governors?,Surprised
891,I know some. I know the Governor of Oklahoma has an Oklahoma shaped pool. Having spent a lot of time in OK I love that!,Happy
891," That's pretty awesome he had a pool in the shape of the state! Well, it was great chatting with you today!",Happy
892,Hi there what do you think about the Republican party? It's definitely had a long history,Curious to dive deeper
892," It certainly has, although I would say I align myself more politically a little blue.",Curious to dive deeper
892," ya I agree, but what is interesting to me is that we have had a democrat or a republican always elected to president since 1853",Surprised
892,I wonder if the two party system has always been that strong that a candidate from another party cant break through.  Like 15% of tea party supporters aligned themselves as democrats,Curious to dive deeper
892,That is interesting. Another interesting fact is that every president with a beard has been a republican. I wonder why that is,Surprised
892," I dont know, I wonder how many that is, I know lincoln for sure, ",Neutral
892," Yep you're right. I know you said that you lean blue, I guess that red and blue has only been consistently associated with Republicans and Democrats since about the year 2000, I always thought it was a lot earlier than that",Surprised
892," I did too, I wonder when the Donkey and Elephant came into play, if those are more recent too or if they have a history as well.",Curious to dive deeper
892," That's a good question. Also I heard that Harry Truman would not get his picture taken with Dumbo because he was a Democrat and obviously Dumbo is an elephant, that seems pretty dumb, would a republican not get his picture taken with Eeyore?",Surprised
892," Im not sure, it might be something the Simpsons would parody (and subsequently anger Fox news)  ",Curious to dive deeper
892," What's interesting to me is that Ronald Reagan campaigned for the Democrats back in the day, he actually did not like corporate profits and low wages and was railing against them",Surprised
892," Wow.  I think the lines of political parties are becoming more and more defined, and more people tend to go to extremes more now than in the past.",Neutral
892," I agree, do you like any current celebrities? I know that Judy makes a ton of money and shes pretty famous",Curious to dive deeper
892,I do like some of the current celebrities.  I like Judge Judy's attitude and sarcasm.  I think its crazy that she is just under LeBron for highest paid celeb.,Neutral
892," Yep you're right. He makes about $120,000 per episode, that's insane, do you like Robin Williams? I'm pretty sad that he's gone",Curious to dive deeper
892," I agree, I loved his work.  He was such a pioneer in the field.  He really started the trend of actors voicing animated characters.  It is a shame that someone who lit up the world of others was struggling so much.",Curious to dive deeper
892," Yep I agree with you. I wonder if he ever got to visit the Pixar secret room. They have a secret room just for celebrities, I hope he was able to",Sad
892," I wonder what their qualifications for celebrity are, like if the person has to be current, or from the US?  ",Curious to dive deeper
892," Yep that's a good question. for instance, there's a celebrity chef in Ethiopia. Would he be allowed to enter haha",Curious to dive deeper
892," From what I hear he is doing work towards fighting hunger in his country.  That would qualify him in my book, although I dont even know his name.",Neutral
892," I agree with you there, he's trying to help his countrymen to eat foods that are more diverse so that they can combat the hunger, but again I don't know if he's gotten access to that room, maybe we should start a fundraiser for that haha",Surprised
892,Now I kinda want to become famous so I can go see that room.  Maybe its just a plain room with some couches and beverages that they play us so the rest of us wonder.,Curious to dive deeper
892," Haha yep or maybe it's just an empty room lol, have you ever seen the show Sesame Street, I guess the first celebrity ever appear on there was Carol Burnett",Happy
893,Hello - how are you today?,Curious to dive deeper
893," Im great, did you watch the Black Panther movie?",Curious to dive deeper
893,I did not. Was it any good?,Curious to dive deeper
893," It was pretty good, you should watch it sometime, Chadwick Boseman plays the role of Black Panther",Curious to dive deeper
893,I'll have to check it out. Do you like soundtracks?,Curious to dive deeper
893," I do, some movies have great sound tracks, do you?",Curious to dive deeper
893,I do as well. Steven Spielberg played the clarinet in the Jaws soundtrack.,Surprised
893," Oh so that was Spielberg, nice I didnt know he was a musician as well",Surprised
893,I didn't know that either. O Brother Where Art Though is certified 8 times platinum.,Surprised
893," I didnt know that either, what movie is that the soundtrack off? do you know?",Curious to dive deeper
893,It's called O Brother Where Art Though. It's a pretty good movie with George Clooney.,Happy
893," Oh I see, did you watch the movie Tron Legacy, it also has a great soundtrack",Curious to dive deeper
893,I did not. Was it a good movie?,Curious to dive deeper
893," It was a great movie, futuristic, theres a sequel thats also great,",Curious to dive deeper
893,That's good. Did you know two identical twins from Japan released a rap album when they turned 100 years old.,Surprised
893," I didnt, that must be a cool album wonder if theres a video, I have to watch that",Curious to dive deeper
893,You should be able to find the video online.,Surprised
893," Im going to search it in Youtube thats a sure thing, do you like Linkin Park?",Curious to dive deeper
893,I love Linkin Park. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
893," I love the band as well, their album the Hybrid Theory is the best-selling album of the 21st century",Curious to dive deeper
893,It was great talking to you!,Happy
894,Have you watched the movie Black Panther?,Curious to dive deeper
894," No, I haven't seen it. Have you seen it? Is it a good film?",Curious to dive deeper
894," I liked it a lot, I thought it had a great soundtrack as well. Most Marvel universe movies are pretty good",Curious to dive deeper
894,K,Neutral
894,You know there was a time when Marvel offered the rights to their characters to Sony but they only bought the rights for Spiderman,Curious to dive deeper
894," Sony just didn't recognize the value of so many of the characters. The Marvel Universe is huge. It's interesting that Marvel trademarked the names ""super-hero"" and ""super villain.""",Neutral
894," It is interesting, you know that there is also a shared hero between the DC and Marvel universes.",Curious to dive deeper
894," Many people have strong preferences about the two universes, but I don't. Usually I'm not big on superhero films, though I understand the attraction for comic book fans. ",Neutral
894," Im more of a Marvel fan myself, the brand saved a lot of money by alleging that mutants werent humans, I bet that idea made them millions.",Curious to dive deeper
894," Speaking of aliens, Michael Jackson tried to buy Marvel at one point so that he could produce a movie of himself as Spiderman.",Neutral
894," That would be a horror movie indeed, it would ruin the childhood of many kids lol,its a good thing Marvel wasnt sold to him.",Happy
894," There have been many Spidermans, but Michael Jackson really would not be right for the role. Maybe he could have played Blue Ear, the character created for the 4-year-old boy uncomfortable with wearing hearing aids.",Neutral
894," I think thats really admirable, creating a superhero for a kid with dissabilities, I wonder what new projects Disney has with Marvel",Curious to dive deeper
894," Probably a ton of sequels, maybe a new character. Black Panther could have a dozen sequels before Disney quits. Kendrick Lamar has job security.",Neutral
894," Yeah, Black Panther was a really popular movie and I wouldnt be suprised if more sequels were to come out, so chaging the subject a bit, what kind of music do you like, heard any good albums lately?",Curious to dive deeper
894,I don't really listen to new music much. The industry has changed and so have tasts. I think bands have a tricky relationship with the rock press. Zeppelin did not give a name to their fourth album in order to confuse the press.,Neutral
894," I bet that confused a lot of people lol, my favorite band is Linking Park and one of their albums is considered the best selling album of the century",Curious to dive deeper
894,I know that Linkin Park did a lot of touring. Very popular live band. They might have made more money from touring than album sales. I know that Aerosmith made more money from the game Guitar Hero than from album sales.,Neutral
894,That is surprising! I wonder if the game paid extremely well or the band sign really bad deals for their albums.,Curious to dive deeper
894,They probably got a good royalty from the games company. Musicians probably get better money from games. Michael Jackson contributed to the soundtrack for Sonic 3.,Neutral
894," I wonder what his contribution was, Spielberg also contributed in the soundtrack of Jaws, he played the clarinet!!",Surprised
895," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
895," Hello, I am doing well thank you. How about you?",Neutral
895,I am well. Do you like music?,Curious to dive deeper
895," Yes I do like music, I like most kinds of music. What about you?",Curious to dive deeper
895,I like rock and jazz. I also like classical when I need to work. Did you know Steven Spielberg played the clarinet on Jaws?,Surprised
895," Cool. How interesting, no I did not know that. Speaking of soundtracks, did you know that Phil Collins recorded the Tarzan soundtrack in 5 different languages.",Curious to dive deeper
895,Huh... Or the sound track of o brother where art thou was certified platinum 8 times over.,Surprised
895," Wow, I don't think that I have seen that movie in entirety. Another weird fact, Daft Punk negotiated the Tron Legacy sound track during a pancake breakfast while wearing their robot helmets.",Curious to dive deeper
895,Seems like a logical thing to do. Like naming each track on batman begins as a genus of a bat.,Happy
895," Ha, interesting. What is your preferred format for music these days?",Surprised
895," I like digital, spotify. You?",Curious to dive deeper
895," Same, here I don't recall the last time I bought a CD. I used to make mixes for the car pre MP3 jacks.",Neutral
895,Mix tapes.... HA! Did you ever have the huge thing of CDs? LIke a case of 100 and you actually only listened to like 5?,Curious to dive deeper
895," Ha, i meant burned CD's. I think I had the adapter for CD's in my first car. Yes, like a 4 plus inch thick case full of CD's that weighed like 40 pounds.",Surprised
895,HA! Now we have an unlimited library on our spotify or pandora account. I remember doing some serious work on my CDs to make sure I had the right mix.,Happy
895," I know right. Yes, before a trip I'd burn a new CD with all the best songs. What is your favorite CD?",Curious to dive deeper
895,I was an early fan of Dave Matthews so I wore out Under the table and dreaming.,Happy
895," I never really got into Dave Matthews. I liked the classics growing up I like Pink Floyd, probably Dark side of the Moon.",Curious to dive deeper
895,Nice! I love Floyd. I went on a binge yesterday and listened to division bell for about 4 hours.,Happy
895," Nice, even after 40 plus years Dark side of the moon is one of the best selling albums.",Curious to dive deeper
895,I love it! Nice chatting with you!,Happy
896,Do you like to read?,Curious to dive deeper
896," I would love to be able to read! Unfortunately, I am illiterate. I cannot read a word. What about you? Do you like to read?",Curious to dive deeper
896," But if you are illiterate how can you read what Im writting now! just wondering lol, and yeah I do like to read, I dont always have the time though",Curious to dive deeper
896,I guess I'm a good guesser. I don't know. I were always called slow when I were young. I look to go to the library and look at the books.,Neutral
896," That seems a bit messed up,well I like reading and wasnt great at it always so with enough hard work anyone can do it",Curious to dive deeper
896," I'm giving it my all, but I just can keep up with how fast I type. I put the words on the screen, but I type too fast to read them all. If I went to prison, I would read all the time.",Neutral
896,I guess theres not much to do in prison so reading might be one of the few things that can keep you entertained,Curious to dive deeper
896,I should say so? I couldn't just sit watching others read. I'd have to read myself. Did you hear about the guy that studied law in prison? That's an incentive to learn.,Neutral
896," I didnt, can you tell me more about him? ",Curious to dive deeper
896,He was falsely imprisoned. He knew he has to do something. He studied law and found a way to get exonerated. He now helps others get out of prison. A hero. The man is a hero.,Neutral
896," I agree, he is a hero and that must have taken a lot of guts and determination, studying so hard that you can eventually set yourself free.",Curious to dive deeper
896," I think it's inspirational. Reading can set you free. I don't believe that there are more libraries than McD's. That's not possible. Obesity is epidemic, but reading is not.",Neutral
896," Thats amazing, more libraries thatn McDonalds!!!  I guess there is no excuse for not picking a book up, ",Curious to dive deeper
896,What if I'm eating at the moment at McD's? I wouldn't want to get my books greasy.,Neutral
896," Yeah probably not a good combianation, McDonalds and books, Norway supports writters they have a law thats really beneficial to them",Curious to dive deeper
896," That's an incentive to keep writing. Usually it's hard to be a writer, especially if you're illiterate like me. But maybe I'll move to Norway.",Curious to dive deeper
896,Yeah if you become a writter the government will buy 1000 from you and if its a childrens book they will buy 1500,Curious to dive deeper
896," I wonder how much money I would get from that. Is it enough to live on? How many books would I have to write every year? Do they have to be good? I have questions, and I cannot speak Norwegian or even read.",Neutral
896," I dont know, I guess 1000 books at a right price can be enough for a few months or even years and then you can write another one and so on so it seems like a good business model",Curious to dive deeper
896,But it's cold in Norway! Maybe I could go to concerts. Do you go to concerts?,Curious to dive deeper
896," I do like attending concerts, I love music in general theres an amphitheatre in Croatia I would like to visit some time",Curious to dive deeper
897,Did you watch the movie Black Panther?,Curious to dive deeper
897," Yes I saw, it was an OK movie. I don't remember the soundtrack even if there are famous artists on it.  ",Neutral
897," I thought the soundtrack was pretty good, Kendrick Lamar is a good artists and the video of the song All the Stars is good production as well.",Curious to dive deeper
897," I don't follow him, so maybe that why it did not touch me as much, do you think the movie would have been as good if Kendrick Lamar was not involved ?",Curious to dive deeper
897," Yeah I think the movie had a great cast, great director and follows a series of successful movies so yeah",Curious to dive deeper
897," Soundtrack came a long way, it was not as important in the 70s, Steven Spielberg played the clarinet on the Jaws soundtrack, I pretty sure he is not the best clarinet player. ",Neutral
897," I like the band Daft Punk, they were the authors of the sountrack of the movie Tron, did you watch that one?",Curious to dive deeper
897," I have watched the 80s version, it did not featured Daft Punk, but I have heard the soundtrack of the remake, it was good. Did you like it ?",Curious to dive deeper
897," I did like it, I thought it had a nice rhythm to it, I also liked the soundtrack of the movie Batman Begins,",Happy
897," I have heard that each track was a  name of a bat family, but I still did not saw the movie, only the the 90s original, it had also a great soundtrack. ",Neutral
897," You should definetely watch the movie, its one of my favorites although Marvel Comics heros are pretty awesome as well.",Curious to dive deeper
897," I saw a few films from the Marvel universe, what is your favorite Marvel movie ?",Curious to dive deeper
897," I loved the Avengers movie but also like Iron Man, he is one of my favorite heroes, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
897," I really liked Thor : Ragnarock, it was funny. I don't like it when that take themselves to seriously, but sometimes it works like in Logan. ",Neutral
897,I thought it was a great movie as well and thats what I like about Marvel they mix comedy with action and great heroes.,Happy
897," And to think that Sony could have bought the rights to all heroes in 98 for $25 million, they probably are still regretting that decision.  ",Neutral
897," I bet they are as each hero is worth a lot more now, I guess they didnt have faith on the franchise.",Curious to dive deeper
897," Yeah it was a risk, now that is not a risk anymore they are worth a lot and that why Disney paid a lot more than $25 million. ",Neutral
897," I think that was the right call, Disney doesnt have the complete rights though, they cant show big charaters in theme parks as Universal has the rights for those",Curious to dive deeper
897," It is strange in California, it is OK, but not in Florida. But competition is always good. It will make better rides for the public. ",Surprised
897," I agree, although Universal Studios is falling behind, you know Marvel argued that mutants werent humans in court and received a great benefit from that.",Curious to dive deeper
897," Most of the money went to the lawyers, I guess the next superhero franchise will be Objection-Man",Neutral
897,It wont be long that is for sure lol,Curious to dive deeper
898,do you like comic books?,Curious to dive deeper
898,I do . Do you know how Stan Lee ended his calls,Curious to dive deeper
898,Yes he ended them with the word exelsior,Curious to dive deeper
898,Yeah pretty cool DO you know which universes does Marvel take place in?,Curious to dive deeper
898,Yes that is earth 1999999,Curious to dive deeper
898,Yes. Do you know how Marvel coined the terms superhero and supervillain,Curious to dive deeper
898,yes they just published a generic comic book with those names,Curious to dive deeper
898,Yes. Do you know what DC stands for?,Curious to dive deeper
898," Yes it stands for Detective Comics, it is very redundant",Curious to dive deeper
898,Yes. Do you know where is the biggest library of comic books?,Curious to dive deeper
898,Yes that is at Michigan State University and I believe it is the biggest in the world,Curious to dive deeper
898," Yes I was there, they have an amazing collection",Curious to dive deeper
898,Nice. DO you know much about earth?,Curious to dive deeper
898,I know that we have sadly destroyed more than 80% of the forests,Curious to dive deeper
898," Yes it is so sad, In the beginning the day was only 5.5 hours long",Curious to dive deeper
898,Yeah pretty short. Do you believe in extraterrestrials?,Curious to dive deeper
898,I do and it is nice that we have an ambassador now in case they show up,Curious to dive deeper
898,Yes I know. Earth will likely be helium free by the end of the century,Curious to dive deeper
898,Yes no more fun balloons and funny voices,Curious to dive deeper
898,Hahaa I know. SO nice chatting with you,Curious to dive deeper
898,Same here,Happy
899,Hello!,Happy
899," Hi, how are you doing tonight?",Neutral
899,I am great! Thanks :) So do you like reading and going to the library? Half of Americans have library cards. I still go sometimes.,Happy
899," I don't go to the library much. I usually do research online. Still, there are more libraries than Mcdonald's in the US.",Neutral
899," Yes, not a lot of people still go to the library much anymore, but I like to because they have actual books and I love books! In Sacramento you can go to one and check out sewing machines among other items, lol that is great",Surprised
899," Yeah, other places have a similar setup. In Berkeley they have a tool library. Some folks can't afford tools, so they can borrow. Oh my GOD, socialism! Some folks need temporary help, and I don't mind if some of my tax dollars go to something like that.",Neutral
899," I agree! I don't mind my tax dollars going towards helping people. I would like to write and publish a book, in Norway the government will buy 100 copies and send them to libraries throughout the country.",Happy
899," The Norway gov't has a ton of money from oil. I guess I would move there and become a children's author if it weren't for the cold and snow. Still, the women are inspirational.",Neutral
899," Very true, it's a great idea and very valued there I am sure. ",Happy
899," I like that a man falsely imprisoned  spent most of his time at the library to study law and prove his innocence. Books, man, they are SO powerful. Makes me wish I could read. But I'm illiterate.",Neutral
899," I read about that, he was very smart to do what he did...self taught, wow and in law that must have been tough. But yes libraries are amazing, the books in print in your hand has great meaning for me, I like to collect books. You are illiterate?",Happy
899,I can't read even one word! It's a miracle that I can type the words that I do. How are about you? Are you literate? Did you learn to read at the library?,Curious to dive deeper
899,I learne,Happy
899," It's a noble pursuit. Learn to read, and you can teach yourself. Maybe you could even run for Congress one day.",Neutral
899," Sorry that last text sent on accident lol...I learned to read in school. But did go the library a lot too. I am sure a lot of people teach themselves a lot through books on their own. Run for Congress? No way lol, I wouldn't do well in Congress and politics.",Happy
899,You couldn't do worse than the people in there. Plus you could ride on the exclusive subway lines that they have for Congress.,Neutral
899,You are right on that! I wonder if their subway plays any music at all? Have been to any concerts lately?,Curious to dive deeper
899," Naw, concerts cost money and I'm broke, baby, I'm broke!",Neutral
899," That's too bad, me too! I have been to concerts throughout my life though. Seen a lot of my favorite bands. ",Sad
899,Have you seen Linkin Park? I heard really good things about their concerts.,Neutral
899," I wish! One of the few bands I didn't get to see live, and now Chester Bennington has passed so I probably won't see the band without him. They played 324 concerts one year, that's a lot of shows.",Neutral
899," Ah, the energy of youth! Maybe they didn't sleep? I don't know how they did that.",Neutral
899," Well, the Ramones played 2,263 concerts over a 20 year span, non stop. I think they just make it their life. It has been great chatting! Have a great evening!!",Happy
899,The Ramones are fueled by drugs and passion. I could never manage to sustain that kind of energy. They are not human.,Neutral
899," You have a point there, I know I couldn't do it! ",Happy
900," Hello, how are you?",Neutral
900,hello! I'm good! How are you? Do you like comics?,Neutral
900," Yeah, to some degree. I don't read many though.",Neutral
900,I don't read many either but I do like Marvel.  Have you ever heard of Lady Killer?,Neutral
900," Honestly, no I haven't. I've read more on the DC side of things",Neutral
900,Really?  I heard recently that back in 1938 DC paid $130 dollars for the exclusive rights to superman.,Neutral
900," Yeah, they've got their money's worth, that's for sure. ",Curious to dive deeper
900,They definitely did!  I guess comics really got popular in the 1930s.,Neutral
900," I would say a bit later, but they do call it the golden age for a reason. ",Happy
900,I guess they do at that!  Did you know that Michael Jackson tried to buy Marvel so he could play spiderman in a movie?,Neutral
900," I've heard rumors of it, but never if it was true or not. I do feel bad for him, he never really was a child.",Sad
900,I know.  With his popularity back then Marvel should have financed a movie with him in it. It probably would have been a blockbuster.,Neutral
900," It would have been interesting, to say the least. I can see why they didn't want to risk Spiderman though, make him into a joke.",Curious to dive deeper
900,I suppose.  Are you interested in outerspace?,Neutral
900," Yeah, I love space and science stuff. Big nerd. :)",Neutral
900,What do you think about Jupiter saving us from asteroids?,Neutral
900," I don't see a reason why it wouldn't be at least partly true. It's a big gravity well, protects us. As does the moon",Curious to dive deeper
900," I can see how it would stop some asteroids.  You know, on the subject of gravity, the hudson bay region in canada has less gravity than anywhere else on the planet.",Neutral
900," Interesting, I wonder if its due to the density of rock below the bay or if there's something else going on",Curious to dive deeper
900,I don't know. Would rock density make a difference in some way?,Curious to dive deeper
900," Yeah, a great deal. Mass and gravity are intertwined. ",Curious to dive deeper
900,I see.  That's interesting to think about.,Neutral
901," Hi, do you go to the library often?",Curious to dive deeper
901,Funny i'm in one right now. lol!,Curious to dive deeper
901,HA! So I am guessing yes... Are you there just for this?,Happy
901,Yes and a few other things but this mainly. Libraries are awesome.,Curious to dive deeper
901,I agree. There's a library that offers sewing machine check out!,Surprised
901," Wow that sounds pretty cool, better not drop it or you bought it though!.",Curious to dive deeper
901,HA! THere's also a library that loans out tools. Thats neat too.,Happy
901,Yeah i think that's a great ideal. Did you know the library of Alexandria has a copy of the internet.,Curious to dive deeper
901," Good, I really want them to keep a copy of this chat. I feel like great things are ahead!",Happy
901," Awe, lol! Hey if you publish a book in Norway the government will buy 1000 copies 1500 if it's a children's book.",Curious to dive deeper
901,We should publish this as a book and get some money from Norway. See the chat is getting monetary now!,Happy
901,That's what's up!! Why is Elmo testifying before the us congress? I know it sounds like the beginning of a joke but seriously.,Curious to dive deeper
901,Because Big Bird couldn't get throught the metal detector. She had bird flu.,Happy
901,Stop it!! Have you ever heard of Fantasy congress before? Apparently it's just like fantasy football.,Curious to dive deeper
901,I have not but I think that would be a good way to introduce civics in HS. everyone knows fantasy now-a-days.,Happy
901,Right!! There has been a Dem vs. /rep baseball game since 1909 and the Rep are winning by 3.,Curious to dive deeper
901,Do they let women play on the teams? The first one was in congress in 1916 and couldn't even vote!,Surprised
901,That sounds like a slap in the face to me. Just her an Elmo hanging out with the gavel.,Curious to dive deeper
901," If it was post-nixon, you mean gavelS....",Happy
901," Right Tricky Dicks got a temper, always breaking stuff. Man Linkin Park played 324 concerts in 2001.",Curious to dive deeper
901,That's a lot of shows! Nice chatting with you!,Happy
902,The soundtrack of a movie is a really big deal!,Curious to dive deeper
902," Yea, on the Jaws soundtrack Spielberg played the clarinet",Neutral
902,So his not only the director of the movie but was also one of the musicians? thats awesome,Surprised
902," Did you ever listen to the O Brother, Where art thou? soundtrack, it is certified 8 times platinum ",Curious to dive deeper
902," No not really Im not familired with that soundtrack I am with the one of the movie Tron Legacy, ",Curious to dive deeper
902,Wasn't Daft Punk involved with the Tron Legacy soundtrack?,Curious to dive deeper
902," Yeah they netgotiated the terms of the soundtrack over pancakes, they even wore their robot helmets, hell of a breakfast",Curious to dive deeper
902," Interesting. I never knew Phil Collins worked on the Tarzan soundtrack, wasn't much of a good movie",Neutral
902," I heard he recorded the sountack in 5 different languages, talented guy",Curious to dive deeper
902," The batman begins soundtrack was pretty good, I never knew the track titles were names of bat genuses",Surprised
902," I loved that soundtrack, really inspiring actually, Batman Begins is one of my favorite movies",Curious to dive deeper
902,Yea the Batman and Marvel movies are really good. It's crazy Sony rejected Marvel's offer to buy all it's characters for $25 million,Surprised
902," Sony must be regretting that decision each hero is worh like 20 times that amount know, that was a great bargain",Curious to dive deeper
902," Yea, I bet Sony is kicking itself for only pay 10 million for Spiderman back in 1998",Neutral
902,Did you like the Sony Spiderman movies?,Curious to dive deeper
902,I liked the first two with Tobey McGuire,Neutral
902," I liked them as well but I have to say im digging the new version more, Im exited to watch the Spiderman movie after Infinity War",Curious to dive deeper
902," Yea I hope it's good, maybe the hero owned by both Marvel and DC   called Access will make a cameo",Neutral
902," There is also a hero called Blue Ear, have you heard of him?",Curious to dive deeper
902,Isn't Blue Ear the hero with hearing aids?,Curious to dive deeper
902," Yeah the same one, Marvel created the character to help a kid that didnt want to wear them. ",Curious to dive deeper
903,Hello! Have you been to a library recently?,Curious to dive deeper
903," I have not, but I do walk by one everyday.  What about you?",Curious to dive deeper
903," With my daughter once in a while, though she goes to her school library more now. I understand Norway will buy 1000 copies of a published book and distribute to libraries.",Curious to dive deeper
903,That is awesome.  A new state of the art library was just built in my neighborhood.,Curious to dive deeper
903,Nice. What's state of the art about it?,Curious to dive deeper
903," It has a bunch of new technology in it, drones, coding equipment, etc.",Curious to dive deeper
903," Really? That's cool. I see sacramento CA also offers industrial items like sewing machines and other things like that, besides books.",Curious to dive deeper
903,cool.  They also have concerts there as well.,Curious to dive deeper
903,Very cool. Cultural experience at a library.,Surprised
903,Yes.  Do you like concerts?,Curious to dive deeper
903," Sure. I have been to just a few, namely Foo Fighters, Snow Patrol, and Mumford and Sons. You?",Happy
903," I like concerts as well, been to more pop groups.  I also like going to summer concert series, kind of like a town hall meet up with a band in the summer",Curious to dive deeper
903," Sure, and better outside sometimes too. I forgot that I went to a festival near where I live for an outdoor flyleaf concert too.",Neutral
903,Yes.  Do you like politics?,Curious to dive deeper
903,Sure. Do you get involved?,Curious to dive deeper
903," I live in Washington DC, I hear about it all the time.  I follow it, but don't do rallies or anything.",Curious to dive deeper
903," Ah, I see that Elmo is the only non-human to testify before Congress... and probably did well",Neutral
903,You've got a point there.,Surprised
903," Hah.  I vote for midterms and national elections, but not much further involvement.",Neutral
903,That is about my involvement as well.,Neutral
903,Good talking to you!,Neutral
904,hey there do you have Netflix by chance?,Curious to dive deeper
904," Hello - how are you? I do have Netflix, what about you?",Happy
904," I'm good, and ya I like Netflix I like Stranger things a lot, can't believe they started way back in 1997",Curious to dive deeper
904,I love Netflix too,Happy
904,ya its crazy that it takes up about 33% of all internet traffic,Curious to dive deeper
904,That is crazy. Did you know Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth?,Surprised
904," no that is wild, I see why they want to switch to all digital, also crazy that netflix and youtube together make up half of all internet traffic, I watch youtube all the time",Surprised
904,That is also crazy. I didn't realize Reed Hastings was inspired to startup Netflix after racking up $40 in late fees on Apollo 13.,Surprised
904," haha ya that is a wild thing, good movie though, sad that blockbuster didn't buy them when they had the chance",Surprised
904,I agree. Crazy that Netflix is now worth $2 billion.,Surprised
904," yup, they were offered to blockbuster for 50 million, thats quite a lot of value appreciation!",Surprised
904,That is a very big jump in appreciation. Did you know that people fantasy draft the national spelling bee lol?,Surprised
904," oh I did, they also do fantasy congress, people seem to do fantasy everything these days haha",Surprised
904,lol that's hilarious. I only do fantasy football. What about you?,Happy
904," ya I only do fantasy football as well, ahve you read any books by Terry Pratchett btw? he writes fantasy novels",Curious to dive deeper
904,I have not read any books by him. Wonder if they are any good?,Curious to dive deeper
904," ya I don't know, I just know he was knighted for ""services to literature"" so hopefully they are really good",Curious to dive deeper
904,Interesting. Did you know a single fold in the brain makes the difference between reality and fantasy?,Surprised
904," I didn't, would you ever check out that fantasy novel from that janitor in chicago, I guess it was like 15k pages haha",Curious to dive deeper
904,haha I think I would have to pass on that. Way too long for me.,Curious to dive deeper
904," yup, it could be amazing but it could also be that long and horrible haha",Curious to dive deeper
904,It was good talking to you!,Happy
905,Hi do you watch netflix?,Curious to dive deeper
905,I sure do. It is the most popular one right now it seems,Curious to dive deeper
905,Yeah considering in the morning 33% of the bandwidth is taken up by them in NA,Curious to dive deeper
905,Yeah pretty crazy. Do you know who invented it?,Curious to dive deeper
905,A guy who got tired of paying late fees on VHSs and decided to start something new,Curious to dive deeper
905,Yeah Did you ever use Blckbuster?,Curious to dive deeper
905,I sued to before. Too bad they passed on buying netflix when they could,Curious to dive deeper
905," Exactly, could have spent $50 million and make billions now",Curious to dive deeper
905," Not a very smart business decisoon, bet they are kicking themselves about it",Curious to dive deeper
905,Yup. WIth youtube they make half of the peak internet usage in NA,Curious to dive deeper
905,That is crazy. And they spend 20 times more on postage still than on the bandwidth,Curious to dive deeper
905," One wonders, what are they shipping now that all is digital?",Curious to dive deeper
905,Exactly. Do you like the Lego company?,Curious to dive deeper
905," Yeah they are pretty cool. Their bricks are really consistent it seems , only 18 out of 1 million are defective",Curious to dive deeper
905,that makes for great quality and in turn for awesome business,Curious to dive deeper
905,pretty much. If all lego bricks available were shared among people everyone would get 86,Curious to dive deeper
905,Nice. A german artist once painted a bridge to make it look like it was made of lego,Curious to dive deeper
905,Neat. If workers word at their company for 25 years they would get a 14 karat gold lego,Curious to dive deeper
905," yeah and it was worth a lot, $15 000",Curious to dive deeper
905," That us a sweet bonus, but then again t is also dedication",Curious to dive deeper
905,Yeah agree with you there.,Curious to dive deeper
906," Hello,  do u watch Netflix?",Happy
906," Hi, yes I do watch Netflix. Do you?",Curious to dive deeper
906," Yes,  love netflix.  Watching anything good?",Surprised
906," I liked the Marvel shows, like luke cage, but they canceled those. You?",Curious to dive deeper
906," I have been watching the Marvel movies recently,  theres a lot on Netfllix right now.  I never watched luke cage though,  any good?  I watched jessica jones,  but didnt really like it too much.  I am currently watching the flash and catching up on the walking dead. ",Neutral
906,It was pretty good. They recently canceled those shows so I have lost all motivation to watch them. I do watch the flash though. I really like it. Do you also watch the arrow?,Curious to dive deeper
906," i watched like 2 seasons of the arrow,  but I dont like it much,  hes too dark,  he can never be happy.  I only kept watching is cuz felicity smoak is awesome!",Surprised
906,Yeah I like her. Last season got of the rails a little and I completely understand your dark comment. It can get really dark. I find it entertaining though. What else do you watch?,Curious to dive deeper
906," I watch a lot of comedy stuff,  How i met your mother,  friends,  the good place,  the santa clarita diet, stuff like that,  easy stuff.  I do like a lot of drama though,  like westworld,  the handmaids tale etc. ",Neutral
906,Nice. How I met your mother was underrated. I really like westworld but I can get confused watching it. I watch a lot of live sports too.,Happy
906," Oh ok thats cool.  Yes,  westworld is confusing.    I really like some of the netflix originals too,  like black mirror and maniac.  have you watched those?",Neutral
906,I tried watching black mirror but it was a little too weird for me. Never saw maniac. What's it about?,Curious to dive deeper
906,Maniac is confusing too lol I am not sure right now cuz I havent finished it.  Black mirror is really creepy but I find it entertaining because it has all to do with the bad places technology can take us.  Its trippy.,Neutral
906,That stuff is pretty scary. Kinda makes me want to shut down my digital life and write letters again.,Fearful
906," Yeah seriously,  but at the same time the show is enlightening,  kinda showing us what we dont want to happen with our future in techonology. ",Surprised
906,It doesn't help that companies continuously sell or lose our data...,Fearful
906," yeah thats definitely upsetting,  they want us to always give info for ""security"" reasons then they get hacked or whatever,  ",Surprised
906," Someone once told me if you did not buy a product, you are the product. I scoffed at them but now it makes so much sense.",Sad
906,what do you mean?,Curious to dive deeper
906," When you buy a product, you get something in return. If you do not buy something, like facebook, youare the product. They are selling you to others through your data or ads.",Sad
906," Oh I get it,  wow thats scary lol ",Surprised
906,Yeah... Nice chatting with you!,Happy

907," i have not seen it yet, but i hear good things about it. you?",Neutral
907," Yes,  it is a great movie.  Not really funny like the other marvel movies still good though.  Black panther is actually the richest super hero. ",Curious to dive deeper
907,will he ever become prsident and be the richest president in history? maybe he should. when was the character created?,Neutral
907," Why should he do that,  he owns a country and hes a super hero, no time to be president lol ",Curious to dive deeper
907," well, he should at least test the waters. he has the cash to buy the whole congress.",Neutral
907," Seems like more stress to me.  If you are already rich,  why not just enjoy life and vacation,  see the world,  live stress free!  ",Curious to dive deeper
907," yes, i guess he could kick back, but the world is in trouble and we need his help. Superheroes have no choice. they must help",Neutral

907," Yeah,  really funny and a lot of action.  ",Curious to dive deeper
907," Hey, kids, get a load of the campy vomit scene? Right? Right? Ha ha! Oh, boy, that is a great exorcism!",Neutral
907,lol yeah,Curious to dive deeper
907," So, what do we have here, albums and Drake. Albums? Drake? Albums. What is your favorite album?",Neutral
907,I think my favorite album is Bryce Vine.  How about yourself?,Curious to dive deeper
907,I have been listening to Bill Evans a lot recently. He was a jazz pianist.,Neutral

907," Yes, give him a listen. Waltz for Debby. Start with that album. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
907," Its been a good chat,  thanks! ",Neutral
908,hey did you know the richest superhero is black panther?,Curious to dive deeper
908,I did not. I found the article on Paul Rand humourous!,Happy
908,don't think Ive seen that article what does it say?,Curious to dive deeper
908," ""On Saturday, Ryan tweeted and then deleted this: ""A secretary at a public high school in Lancaster, PA, said she was pleasantly surprised her pay went up $1.50 a week ... she said [that] will more than cover her Costco membership for the year."" The responses were not kind... Twitter is the best and worst!",Happy
908," lol ya that is not a lot of money, oooof what a disaster haha",Curious to dive deeper
908," I know. Here's a response: If she's 30 and saved that 1.50 until she's 65, thats $2,750. Totally makes up for losing Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, which is how they are planning to repay the 1.5 Trillion they added to the deficit",Happy
908," haha ya politics is a joke, I try not to read the news because i'ts too depressing, other thing I can't believe is that linkin park's ""hybrid theory"" is the best selling record of the 21st century, that is also scary to me",Surprised
908,Really!? I love that album. Like the one with Jay Z too.,Happy
908," oh really, ya I just don't like lincoln park, thats just me though I'm more into classic rock and 80's music",Happy
908,What is your band? I listen to classic rock a lot at the gym.,Happy
908," ah I mean I like metallica and guns and roses a lot, but ive heard them so many times I've been diving into lesser known 80s bands recently",Happy
908,Do you consider Metallica and G&R classic rock? What 80s bands?,Curious to dive deeper
908," I do, you could say metallica is more metal but they got to be more rock-like in the 90's, I like thompson twins hold me now, I've been listening to that a lot recently",Happy
908,That's interesting... I am 40 and think of Led Zepplin when I think classic rock. Is this an age thing?,Curious to dive deeper
908," ah it might be haha, or maybe i'm just wrong, I do love led zepplin though, pink floyd is also amazing",Happy
908," Pink floyd is my favorite band, or should I say the one I consistently listen to and do not get bored with. I can listen to them all the time whereas other bands I turn off after a while...",Happy
908," oh wow interesting, ya I got into them and I think their animals album is super underrated, like you don't heard songs from that album on the radio at all",Happy
908," No, that's one of their sneaky albums. Dark side of the moon is the commercial hit but the others are just as good.",Happy
908," yup dark side and the wall are the ones that everyone knows, but they're so overplayed that I got into their other stuff which you're right is just as good if not better",Happy
908,It makes me sad that artists like them wouldn't be successful in today's market.,Sad
908,nope people don't like that kind of music unfortunately these days,Happy
908,Nice chatting with you.,Happy
909,Hello! How are you tonight?,Curious to dive deeper
909," Hi there, I am well thank you.  Are you interested in astronomy?",Curious to dive deeper
909,I am! I think the whole universe is such a marvelous thing! how about you?,Surprised
909," Yeah same here, I think it is all pretty amazing.  ",Happy
909,I would never want to be on that planet that has shards of glass traveling sideways at 4500 mph!,Curious to dive deeper
909," Holy cow, I wonder how they found that and then determined that is what happens there. ",Curious to dive deeper
909,I was thinking the same thing. So crazy to believe there are that many planets out there! Even our planet is crazy!,Curious to dive deeper
909,Yeah it's crazy to think what is actually out there.  Even moons of planets can be pretty crazy.,Curious to dive deeper
909," I agree! Did you know if earth's history was view as a 24 hour period, humans would only take up 1 minutes and 17 seconds of it?",Curious to dive deeper
909,That makes you think how small we are in the grand scheme of time.,Curious to dive deeper
909," And in that time, we've managed to destroy 80 percent of the natural forests. So sad!",Sad
909," That is super sad, and that's not something that you can just fix very quickly as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
909,I'm sure we'll always have a problem with trees. I know we are going to be helium free by the end of the 21st century so that is sad as well!,Curious to dive deeper
909," That is wild to think, I wonder what the balloon companies will do to survive?",Curious to dive deeper
909," I wonder that all the town, and clowns haha. I guess I could do without them lol.",Curious to dive deeper
909," Lol, did you know that when the earth was first formed the days were only 5.5 hours long?",Curious to dive deeper
909,Oh really? That is nuts! I don't think I would ever get a good sleep back in the day! I wonder how it got to be 24 hours and stay like it?,Curious to dive deeper
909," Well i don't think it's staying like it, but maybe i'm wrong, I think in another couple hundred thousand years the days will be a bit longer. ",Curious to dive deeper
909,I think you're onto something! I wonder if I will ever be the UN ambassador to aliens?,Curious to dive deeper
909," Lol, I wonder how much that job pays, that sounds like a pretty sweet gig to me. ",Curious to dive deeper
909," I think I'll look into it. It was nice chatting with you, have a good night!",Curious to dive deeper
910," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
910,I'm good. Do you remember listening to albums?,Curious to dive deeper
910," Like a music CD? I love them, I especially love Linkin Park",Curious to dive deeper
910,I like Linkin Park okay. It's not my favorite. My spouse likes them and Staind.,Neutral
910," I love Linkin Park, and they sold some really profitable albums too!",Curious to dive deeper
910," They must be popular, because I still see them on tour. I can't believe all the ""old"" bands that are still around and touring. ",Surprised
910," Unfortunately the singer killed himself a year or two ago, so now it is just Mike Shinoda",Curious to dive deeper
910,I think I remember my spouse saying something about that. I think more needs to be done about suicide awareness.,Sad
910," I agree, it is a shame people still think it is people being dramatic",Curious to dive deeper
910," I don't think it is people being dramatic. Maybe there are a few who like to get attention that way, but I think they still have a mental health problem if they repeatedly say they are going to kill themselves. I know it used to be an expression to say, ""I could just die."" ",Curious to dive deeper
910," Yeah I agree, it is unfortunate, and Linkin Park helped a lot of people through that too, so it is a shame he had bad issues",Sad
910," Yes, I think that and the death of other famous people, like Robin Williams. A friend's husband committed suicide last year. It has been very hard on her family.",Sad
910," I can only imagine, such a sad thing. ",Sad
910," Yes, she really struggles coming to terms with the situation. She posts about it a lot on social media. Who can blame her. She probably asks herself why this happened every single day. ",Sad
910," It is truly sad. On another note, have you seen Black Panther?",Curious to dive deeper
910," No, I haven't seen that movie. I'm surprised, because my spouse likes to watch the Marvel movies. I think he was turned off by the last Avengers movie, though.",Surprised
910," I was as well, it did not impress me at all. Black Panther did very well at the box office, over a billion at least",Happy
910," Wow! I may have to mention it to my spouse and see if he wants to watch it. He will be impressed since I am always wanting to watch ""girlie"" movies according to him. ",Happy
910," Haha, that is the trade off, but Black Panther was very good, the character in the movie is said to be worth 500 billion dollars",Curious to dive deeper
910,That is a big difference from Tony Stark who is only worth $100 billion!,Surprised
910," That is for sure, or even bruce wayne, who is at 80 billion",Surprised
911,Did you hear that a Super Earth may have been discovered?,Curious to dive deeper
911," Hi! Yes, I heard! It's mind blowing and extremely excited. I heard its unlike anything in our solar system!",Curious to dive deeper
911," Crazy, I wonder if it has aliens? ",Curious to dive deeper
911," Hmmm, I don't know, but I wonder too! I feel like there very well be something living there. Researchers say its larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune and far enough from the din. red sun and any water on its surface is locked away by ice... sounds like a Cold Planet...NO THANKS! Id consider Mars... haha",Curious to dive deeper
911,Well apparently it is near Proxima Centauri.,Curious to dive deeper
911," AND only 6 light years away from the sun...fun fact, this new Earth is TWICE as OLD as the sun! mind blown!",Curious to dive deeper
911,Wow! Apparently Peter Kamp thought years ago that star could host a planet.,Surprised
911,They have been studying this since the 70's... Why are we hearing about this now?! These are exciting news!,Curious to dive deeper
911,Interesting. I'm not sure. Did you know the planet Venus does not tilt?,Curious to dive deeper
911," Interesting fact. I was not aware but I did learn that in 1975 the soviet union successfully sent a spacecraft to venus, which captures first images from the surface of ANOTHER planet! imagine THAT selfie!",Curious to dive deeper
911,Hilarious. Well apparently when the earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long.,Happy
911," and we think there isn't enough time in a day now, Wow. I wonder if we already called Earth Gaia at that time, or Tellus or telluris which is one of many Earth's names... um who came up with these names?! I am doing some research after this! fascinating.",Curious to dive deeper
911,I'm not sure. But Earth's interior core remains active with solid iron.,Curious to dive deeper
911,Solid Iron eh? well I'm glad! and Thank You Jupiter for saving Earth from many asteroids that head our way. Would you ever consider leaving the planet? There is an open space in Mars one apparently.,Surprised
911," Yeah, apparently the solid iron is surrounded by a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magenetic field. ",Curious to dive deeper
911," interesting, I imaginen it changes direction when Earth does? because it happens every 200,000-300,000 years.  Did you know that if you fit all the planets in between earth an the moon and still have room  left over to spare?",Curious to dive deeper
911," No, I didn't know that. Apparently the UN appointed an ambassador to aliens though, pretty wild stuff!",Curious to dive deeper
911," I knew it! haha, Im sure they know more than they lead on, I would LOVE to know though! i know most of the time is to avoid panic but wish i was in on the secrets imagine all the cool stuff they must find out about!",Surprised
911," Yeah, it reminds me of that movie Independence Day. Hilarious!",Curious to dive deeper
911," yes, and it talks about it in a really good book its over 100 years old the book is called ""Barron Trump, the marvelous underground adventures"" something like that. It talks about our days today...pretty creepy right on. Did you know The term Robotics was accidentally coined by science fiction in 1941 by author issac asimov",Surprised
911,Interesting. There's a wiki that ranks fictional characters as well. Nice meeting you!,Curious to dive deeper
912,Have you heard about the Super Earth?,Curious to dive deeper
912,Is that evidence of an alien world?,Curious to dive deeper
912," I think it is a possibility...It a planet with the same distance and conditiions from its sun but it is frozen,",Curious to dive deeper
912,Did you know that the planet Venus does not tilt?,Curious to dive deeper
912,I wonder if it is so close to the sun?,Curious to dive deeper
912,That could be so.,Neutral
912,It also rotates counter clock wise!,Curious to dive deeper
912,Is that true?,Curious to dive deeper
912," Yep, and it has not seasons either.  Just hot Im sure lol.",Curious to dive deeper
912,Either that or it is really cold!,Surprised
912,Nah it is super hot as the it is closer to the sun.  Earth is the 3rd planet from the sun,Curious to dive deeper
912,Earth is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life as well.,Neutral
912,That we know of...need water for life and Earth has 71 percent covered.,Curious to dive deeper
912," Yes, mostly by oceans.",Curious to dive deeper
912,And our polar regions.,Curious to dive deeper
912,It's sad to think that more than 80 percent of the Earth's natural forests have already been destroyed.,Sad
912," Yeah, we keep growing...we will need to find another planet to live on one day!",Curious to dive deeper
912,No kidding.,Curious to dive deeper
912,It will have to have a satellite or moon along with oceans,Curious to dive deeper
912,Most certainly.,Curious to dive deeper
912,Interesting talking to you take care!,Curious to dive deeper
912," Yes, you too!",Happy
912,See you on another planet possibly haha.,Surprised
913," Hi, how are you? Do you like music?",Neutral
913,I love music. I'm a professional guitarist. Though I'm nowhere close to being Brian May! Did you know he's also a physicist??,Curious to dive deeper
913,He started studying physics then joined a band. Bright guy. Youre a professional guitarist? Thats great!,Neutral
913,Thanks! What type of music do you like? Any angsty Broadway musical numbers like Eddie Perfect wrote for Beetlejuice?,Curious to dive deeper
913,Eddie Perfect? Who is that? I have seen the movie Beetlejuice.,Neutral
913,He was an Australian composer who ended up writing the music for the Broadway adaptation of the movie. Really interesting story there.,Neutral
913,I did not know that. I guess he must have done other stuff as well.,Neutral
913,Oh yeah. He also wrote songs for King Kong the musical! Can you imagine how weird that show must have been ha ha?,Happy
913,That sounds strange for a musical.  Do you like jazz much?,Neutral
913,Jazz is my soul. I prefer bebop the most. I never really liked the cool jazz that came out in the 40s much. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
913," I like Sonny Rollins and Bill Evans. By the way, Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and scored several films, including Million dollar baby",Neutral
913," You're right, he is! Crazy to think of a gruff Clint Eastwood sitting at a piano writing soft melodies ha ha. ",Surprised
913,Jazz is in the oddest places too. Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts.,Neutral
913,It's crazy how culture spreads like that. I mean look at comedy. It goes all the way back to ancient Greece!,Surprised
913,Comedy is fundamental to human existence. Did you know that jazz trumpeters grew goatees as it provided comfort when playing? I thought it was a fashion.,Neutral
913,I've heard about that somewhere. It does make them look cool though. But what's cooler is that there's a whole programming language written in music. Crazy!,Surprised
913,I wonder who uses that language. You know what else is crazy: A Harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every Sunday for 20 years!,Neutral
913," Yeah, she's awesome! I wonder if she ever went to see Beetlejuice. Apparently Eddie Perfect's music was a ""perfect"" fit for it. Excuse the bad pun ha ha.",Happy
913," I wonder too. Anyway, great chat, cat!",Neutral
913,You too brother. Keep on rocking in the free world. Peace!,Happy
913,Rock it dawg,Neutral
913,Set the world ablaze like Eddie Van Halen did to his speakers. Adios.,Neutral
914,did you know Van Halen set speakers on fire with his playing! That is so metal,Surprised
914,I had never heard that!  There are some crazy rockers out there - Queen's guitarist has a phd in astrophysics,Curious to dive deeper
914," that is cool, I think he also uses coins as guitar picks, he's super talented!",Surprised
914,Yeah those guys are nuts.  A member of Pink Floyd uses a houseboat on the Thames as a recording studio,Curious to dive deeper
914," that is cool, do you like PInk Floyd? I like them a lot I still listen to all their music",Curious to dive deeper
914,I do not.  I like jazz more - just like Clint Eastwood,Neutral
914," ya I never got into Jazz, what are some albums I should listen to? I do like Clint Eastwood though",Curious to dive deeper
914,I like the blues and ragtime styles best the most - anything from New Orleans is great!,Neutral
914," ok I'll check it out, have you heard Pakistan has jazz music?",Curious to dive deeper
914,I did not know that.  Kansas City does too!,Neutral
914,ya but does Kansas City have a jazz orchestra at the top of the charts? Because Pakistan apparently does haha,Happy
914," I had never heard of that! But I guess if a programming language can have jazz roots, what doesn't ?",Surprised
914," haha that is true, did you know that professional jazz trumpeters grow goatees for better comfort while playing",Surprised
914,That makes sense!     I am a fan of sitcoms - do you like 3rd Rock from the sun?,Curious to dive deeper
914,I've never seen it is it any good? I do like Seinfeld a lot,Curious to dive deeper
914,Yes it beat Seinfeld in the Golden Globe competition in 1997,Neutral
914," well if it's funny maybe I should check it out, do you like Bill Murray?",Curious to dive deeper
914,Yes!  I love him - we both think Kung Fu hustle was hilarious,Neutral
914,I agree! Not everyone likes that movie and it is really wacky but I'm glad there are other fans out there!,Curious to dive deeper
914,Yes there are a lot of different styles of comedy - it has evolved a lot since ancient greece,Neutral
914," Yup it's evolved since then and even since MOnty Python which I also like, and is why the programming language is named python",Surprised
915,Have you heard of Eddie Perfect?,Curious to dive deeper
915,Isn't he a composer?,Curious to dive deeper
915," Yes, he was involved in a musical version of Beetlejuice. Have you watched Beetlejuice?",Curious to dive deeper
915,I have but not in a long time. Scared the heck out of me when I first saw it. Have you seen it?,Curious to dive deeper
915," Oh, man! I was about to say that! I watched it when I was younger. I think it would still creep me out.",Fearful
915,I know. Bill Murray thinks Kung Fu Hustle is the best comedy today. I think he may be pulling our leg...,Curious to dive deeper
915,I don't think I've watched that! I have watched Green Lantern. I did not know that originally that was supposed to be a Jack Black comedy!,Surprised
915,I liked that movie but I know it can crushed. I thought it was fun. I also wasn't expecting much...,Curious to dive deeper
915,Did you ever watch 3rd rock from the sun?,Curious to dive deeper
915,I did. I loved that show. Hated French Stewart though...,Happy
915," Really? I never thought 3rd Rock was funny. I preferred Friends and Seinfeld, though I know 3rd rock beat them for the Golden Globe in 1997",Surprised
915,I liked those shows too and they were better than 3rd rock. I did see friends the other day and it did not hold up. It was bad.,Sad
915,Haha. Do you like Comedy Central shows?,Surprised
915," I did, when the show was Chapelle's show. Do you watch it?",Curious to dive deeper
915,I do not watch it. CN has had over 100 shows cancelled!,Surprised
915,That seems like a lot. I wonder how many hetwork shows have had canceled?,Curious to dive deeper
915,I prefer to listen to music than to watch tv. Matthew Bellamy has the record for most smashed guitars on tour.,Surprised
915,what a waste! I hope he has a guitar deal. Jazz trumpeters grew goatees for comfort...,Surprised
915," Ah, always thought it was just the style. Did you know Queen's guitarist has a PhD in astrophysics? I guess he had a backup plan!",Surprised
915,That's a pretty good backup plan! Eddie Van halen was on Beat it? I had no clue!,Surprised
915,And he set the studio speakers on fire! Oops!,Surprised
916,Hey there. Do You like the comedy genre? The origins of comedy are actually found in ancient Greece.,Curious to dive deeper
916," I do, comedy is one of my favorite genres, its so cool and  makes e feel poisitive",Curious to dive deeper
916,Yes me too.I just love laughing and comedy induces that.,Happy
916,Do you have a favorite comedy movie? I liked Evan Almighty a lot,Curious to dive deeper
916,That was a good movie. I liked Kung Fu Hustle and Bill Murray did too apparently.,Neutral
916," That was a great movie as well, what about the Empire Strikes Back? the Star Wars movie, did you like that one?",Curious to dive deeper
916,Oh yeah that is a classic and always will be. I like the movie Green Lantern. Jack Black was originally going to star in it.,Surprised
916," Well The Empire Strikes back was considered a comedy movie back in 1981, and really? Jack Back is one of my favorites",Surprised
916,Yes he is one of mine as well. I want to try to watch third rock from the sun because it won a Golden Globe for best comedy in 1997.,Surprised
916," I bet it was a really good show, I havent heard of it before, odd fact but a comedy movie hasnt won a best picture award in over 37 years",Curious to dive deeper
916,I wonder why it's so hard to make good comedy? Comedy Central has canceled over 100 shows since creating it in 1989.,Curious to dive deeper
916," 100 shows? woah thats a lot of them,  I bet they let a lot of people down",Surprised
916,Yes I know I was mad when they canceled the Chapelle show. It was one of my favorites. Do you like jazz music? It emerged in the 1920's with African American and European American roots.,Curious to dive deeper
916," I used to love that show as well so funny. I do like Jazz music, the genre does have deep roots",Curious to dive deeper
916,Yes indeed it does. Jazz is played everywhere. One Harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every Sunday for 20 years.,Surprised
916,I bet her neighbors loved her and then some others hated her as well.,Curious to dive deeper
916,Yeah I hopefully shouldn't play too late. Those jazz players who play the trumpet grow goatees to provide extra comfort when playing.,Surprised
916," Yeah I heard about those, they look really weird but I guess they have their function.",Curious to dive deeper
916,I didn't realize jazz was so global. Even Pakistan has a jazz orchestra. They seem to be doing pretty well.,Surprised
916," Yeah seems like a really talented orchestra, did you ever watch the series Breaking Bad?",Curious to dive deeper
916,Yes I love that series. Heisenberg was the man. Almost as cool as Eddie Van Halen when he set a studio speaker on fire. It was really fun talking with you this afternoon.,Happy
916," I wonder if that's true, its been great chatting with you also have a nice day bye. ",Curious to dive deeper

917,It is my understanding that the first upload to youtube was a guy talking about elephants.  Why would a guy talk about elephants on a dating web site.,Neutral

917,I wish to watch comedy scenes and cartoon videos also. It make me feel better.,Happy
917,Cartoon videos.  Is there a specific one?  Is bug bunny available.  Google bought youtube for $1.65 billion in 2006.  Cat videos must be worth something.,Neutral
917,Tom and Jerry is all time favourite for me. It make out from my stress and feel better and happier. You have any favourite cartoon videos ?,Happy
917,Tom and Jerry are old school proper cartoons.  Animaniacs came in later.  Pinky and the Brain were funny.  Polka Dot?  I have never registered for youtube.,Neutral
917,Today I surely watch this video thank you.,Happy
917,Ayn Rand is often referenced by the Simpsons.  Never thought of her as a poster woman for the tea party.  Good day!,Neutral
918,I recently heard that there are three subway lines used exclusively for members of Congress to move between the Capitol building and their House or Senate office. Crazy!,Surprised
918,Yes. They get many perks,Curious to dive deeper
918," I wonder if they have to wait as long as regular people do, or if the lines are ever down. LOL!",Curious to dive deeper
918,I would think they are running smoothly.,Neutral
918,There is so much random information available these days. I recently heard that the first woman was elected to Congress in 1916 - before she could even vote in the election! We have come a long way!,Surprised
918,yes women have overcome much in the past  hundred years.,Surprised
918," Staying on the topic of random information. I just saw that when Harry Truman was president, he went to Disneyland. While there, he refused to have his picture taken on the Dumbo ride so he wouldn't be associated with Republicans. Truth is definitely stranger than fiction!",Surprised
918,Yes he was worried,Surprised
918," Related to Republicans, do you think Congress will take any action on gun control, now that the Houses are split? It will be interesting to see if the Democrat controlled House will have any pull.",Curious to dive deeper
918,They wont be able to get past the senate,Happy
918,Probably not. It seems that the GOP and the NRA are in lockstep.,Neutral
918,Its been that way for many years.,Fearful
918,True. And apparently legislation is the only way to accomplish real change. The Justice Department does not have the legal authority to do anything.,Sad
918,to get anything done on guns you will need three branches controlled by Democrats,Disgusted
918," Quite possibly. Meanwhile we continue to have mass shootings every couple of months. I'm not sure if the answer is gun control, mental health policy, or both, but we need to do something!",Sad
918," It wont get done anytime soon, unfortunately. ",Angry
918," Probably not. At least not as long as we let the get away with stalling via ""debate"".  Apparently even the NRA is in favor of banning bump stocks, but we still can't get this through Congress. Sad state of affairs.",Sad
918,Too much money involved,Disgusted
918," That's a whole other can of worms. LOL. PAC money and special interests have so much control. Foreign countries, too, apparently.",Sad
918,everyone has their hand in the cookie jar,Angry
918," Yeah, and nothing changes. Politicians sit around collecting pay checks, perks, and pensions, while spending tax payers' money. It's a very sad state of affairs.",Angry
918,People have to keep voting them out when they do the wrong thing,Fearful
919,Hi!  Do you frequently watch YouTube,Neutral
919,i do! every night before bed. How about you?,Neutral
919," I use it quite a bit too, you can truly find anything in there.",Neutral
919,There's something for everyone! It's a shock it began as a dating site,Surprised
919,Really?!  That is kind of crazy.  I also remember when they used to restrict the time of videos to like 10 minutes.,Surprised
919,Nowadays youd be hard pressed to find a good one that's less than that!,Neutral
919," True, although Psy's Gangnam Style is pretty awesome, so good they had to up the integer counter on the video.",Neutral
919,haha that video was such a hit when it came out! I was shocked it blew up so quickly. The song is kinda catchy though you have to admit.,Happy
919,It really.  You just have to dance when you hear it.,Neutral
919," a song I dont like to dance to is Baby by Justin Bieber, the most disliked video on the entire site",Neutral
919," I would agree with you there, it is a pretty annoying song.  I would have disliked it too.",Neutral
919,I heard in 2007 youtube took up as much bandwidth as the entire internet in 2000. That's huge!,Neutral
919," Wow!  It still makes up for half of the internet traffic, along with Netflix.",Neutral
919,absolutely. Do you like to paint?,Neutral
919," I try, but I am not very good.",Neutral
919," you should check out the 70 episodes of Joy of Painting that can be found on YouTube, you may learn a thing or two",Neutral
919,Is that with Bob Ross?,Neutral
919,sure is! He was a national treasure,Neutral
919," I have a feeling hed tell me, happy little trees and not angry blobs.  lol",Neutral
919,But I bet he would be very nice about it!,Happy
919," Probably, I love his stuff.  A local bar has a drunk painting class where you try to paint from one of his videos, while drinking.",Neutral
919,that does sound fun! I think I'm going to go try that class out now. Thanks for chatting!,Happy
920,How are you today? I've really felt like the U.S. hasn't done enough to start reworking gun policy.,Happy
920,I really feel that policy's don't need to be changed to much. GOP Rep. David Jolly doesn't seem to agree though.,Neutral
920," I dont own a gun so i dont have much of a ""dog in this fight"" but i can see how much of the policy we have now is in place for a reason and is working. ",Curious to dive deeper
920,Right. I guess we can all agree to disagree. One thing that we can agree on is how silly it is that the first youtube video uploaded was of a guy talking about elephants!,Surprised
920," Haha, i didnt know that! I wonder how many views it has? ",Neutral
920,I want to look it up and find out! Who knew Youtube began as a dating website. Would people update vidoes of themselves talking about their love interest or something?,Curious to dive deeper
920,I actually thinks thats an interesting idea to have YouTube as a dating site. A tinder before its time!,Curious to dive deeper
920,I agree. You can tell the popularity of the internet has grown since 2000! Youtube alone used the bandwidth in 2007 that 2000 used.,Neutral
920,Im still surprised that YouTube is as big as it is. Im interested to see what overall bandwidth we will be using in 2020!,Surprised
920," Yes! It's unreal. Google bought Youtube in 2006 and I bet they are happy about that investment. Youtube has been able to partner with other streaming providers like Hulu and Vevo, they are really racking in the money.",Neutral
920," OH, those companies would be bringing in so much money! What do you think the most liked video is? ",Surprised
920,I'm not sure but I love how there are 70 full videos of Bob Ross. I love watching him paint its so relaxing!,Happy
920,I love Bob Ross! His squirrel was the best pet ever! I didnt know there are 70 videos!,Neutral
920,Yes I agree! Thats a really good reason to binge on Youtube I guess. haha. I love how Youtube alllows users to upload those types of videos and not ban them. They even allow inappropriate videos for 18 year old users.,Curious to dive deeper
920,What type videos do that have that are inappropriate for 18 years old on YouTube?,Surprised
920,I bet its videos that that are sexually suggestive. Nudity or some sort.,Neutral
920," Oh, that makes sense. yeah those should be removed. ",Curious to dive deeper
920,Yeah. Who would have thought three former Paypal employees would create such as a global platform. Everyone knows about Youtube I'm pretty sure its so popular..,Neutral
920,It would have been great to have invested in the company much earlier!,Neutral
920,I agree! Especially since Youtube was bought by Google for 1.65$ billion!,Neutral
920,Have a great day!,Happy
920,You too,Neutral
921,Do you invest in the stock market?,Curious to dive deeper
921," I do, Lets talk about Snakes , in New Zealand they do not have any snakes at all",Surprised
921," No, but it is not surprising, it is a very isolated place. ",Curious to dive deeper
921,There are snakes called flying snakes that are able to launch themselves at their prey,Surprised
921,Do they have wings?,Curious to dive deeper
921," I dont believe they do. There are legless lizards , they are not snakes but lizards without limbs",Surprised
921,THat's crazy. Apparently the fear of snakes is not hard wired.,Curious to dive deeper
921,I believe it is hard wired not only in humans but also in monkey's,Surprised
921,Interesting. Do you use facebook?,Curious to dive deeper
921," I do, lets talk about that next , as of January 2018 they have more then 2.2 billion monthly active users",Surprised
921," Hmmm, did you participate in the burger king promotion? ",Surprised
921," I did not , not sure why they wanted people to unfriend others ",Curious to dive deeper
921," Yeah, it is a little weird. I remember that promotion. How much is a whopper? $1.00? ",Curious to dive deeper
921,I dont know anymore. The public in Iceland are making suggestions and alterations to their Constitution via Facebook.,Surprised
921,I wonder if that is going to go over really well or not.,Happy
921,Myspace had an option at one point to buy Facebook for 75 million in 2005,Surprised
921," Yeah, probably for the best, they likely would have ruined it. LOL",Happy
921,Facebook;s minimum age to join is 13 for the most part but variations and local law sometimes effect that also.,Surprised
921," Interesting, I didn't know that they have a minimum. Is that for the US? Nice chatting with you. ",Curious to dive deeper
921," Zuckerburg suffers from red-green colorblindness that is why Facebook is mostly blue, nice chatting with you also",Surprised
921,I've never heard that. That is pretty cool. So that's why it is blue and white. Does he know that?,Curious to dive deeper
921," I think he does, the like button is illegal in some areas in Germany. Nice chatting with you ",Surprised
922,Do you believe in evolution?,Curious to dive deeper
922," Yeah, I do.  There's certain aspects of it I can't really explain, but the basic principals I think are sound.",Curious to dive deeper
922," Well apparently we lost our hair as recently as 240,000 years ago.",Curious to dive deeper
922," I started losing my hair about ten years ago... LOL.  Speaking of evolution, did you know we (humans) adapted for persistence hunting? ",Happy
922,I did not know that i think it's pretty cool how animals can synthesize there own vitamin C. but we can't. Leaves some things to question.,Curious to dive deeper
922," I'm curious why that is... I may google it later.. I'm told our ""modern"" ancestors came about starting around 315,000 years ago.  So, we haven't really been around that long, relatively speaking",Surprised
922,Yeah and I've heard of homo sapiens but I've never heard the term taxonomically before. Have you?,Curious to dive deeper
922," I'm not sure, I don't think so.  We do have some neat healing abilities though.  They say he can regrow a rib within only 2-3 months of having it surgically shortened.  Say, jumping tracks here, do you follow basketball any?",Surprised
922,Not at all it boring to me don't have the patients. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
922," I'm not the biggest fan of it TBH, but I do find some of the little details about it fascinating.  For instance, I really admire all the charity work LeBron James has done during his career.",Neutral
922,When you have it to spare it shouldn't be hard to share but i'm happy that he gives back as well.,Curious to dive deeper
922," Course, I find it simply amazing how much money these guys make in endorsement.  For example, some of them get paid over the money just for wearing certain brands of SHOES.",Surprised
922," I know it's the way of the world give it to those who don't need it and take it from those who do...but i digress, lol! ",Curious to dive deeper
922," For example Lebron had an offer for $10 million from Reebok he turned down, then a year he got a $90 million offer from Nike.  Again, we're talking shoes here!  Wonder if any famous non-athletes get shoe endorsement offers?  LOL",Surprised
922,Right! that is very interesting what you said about the ribs growing back. the brain has the ability to reroute blood vessel in the brain as well. the human body is amazing.,Curious to dive deeper
922," Yeah, it is amazing!  They say the brain is a lot like a computer!  Speaking of, do you know the space shuttles general purpose computer runs on a mere 1MB of ram?  All this time and still so little memory!",Surprised
922," Yeah i can't figure out if that's incredibly efficient or stupid, lol. You know if you smoke near apple computers it voids the warranty. ",Curious to dive deeper
922," Yeah, I've heard about that.  They consider it a ""bio-hazard"". Makes sense to me!",Neutral
922,Yeah your right actually! The Russian made a computer that operated on water. That sounds fascinating.,Curious to dive deeper
922," I heard someone made a working 16 bit computer using minecraft building blocks.  I'm not familiar enough with the game to know how that would work, but it sounds pretty amazing!",Surprised
922,Yeah kind of ingenuous actually. That computer that ran on water was in 1936. Anyways nice chatting with you.,Curious to dive deeper
922," Hey, you too!  Have a great night!",Surprised
922," You too parting thought..If you could would you upload your mind to a computer if you could, like the Trashumanists want to? ",Curious to dive deeper
923,Hello. How are you today.,Happy
923,Hi!  pretty well.  how about you?,Neutral
923,Im doing good. Do you have any pets.,Happy
923," Yes, I have two cats - a male and a female.  both black.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
923,Nope. not at the moment. Did you know that they cloned a cat.,Happy
923," Yeah.  I had heard about that.  They called it ""copy cat.""  :) But even if you clone a cat and it looks identical to the original, I wonder if its personality will be the same?",Surprised
923," Im not sure. I know I am a twin which isnt really the same, but we have totally different personalities.",Happy
923," yeah...it's he old nature/nurture question, i guess.  ",Neutral
923,There are more tigers living in as pets in the US than there are living in the wild in asia crazy huh.,Happy
923," Wow!  I didn't realize that.  Hard to believe, but we have been pretty destructive to the wild tiger population over the years!",Disgusted
923,Im just surprised that there are that many kept as pets.,Happy
923,I believe that there are certain areas of the world where that is more common than in others.  I saw a TV program on a rescue for big cats whose owners had tired of them.  or become afraid of them...,Neutral
923,I dont think I would trust them enough to keep one as a pet. I have kids though.,Happy
923,oh well...then you are probably used to wild beasts ;)  Did you know Theodore Roosevelt had over 20 pets?  Including a bear and a heyena.,Happy
923,Yeah what could you do with a hyena. Lol. What a weird pet to have.,Happy
923," good for a laugh, I'd say!",Happy
923,Did you know that its not legal in boulder CO to own pets.,Happy
923,,Disgusted
923,Yeah I was thinking the same thing. I wonder if you get arrested if you say thats my dog. Lol.,Happy
923," I grew  up with dogs...Old English Sheepdogs, to be specific.  I love them too.  just can fit a big dog in a small apartment.",Sad
923," Same here I always had dogs growing up, but I live in a trailer so dont have much room either.",Happy
923," I like the big breeds - the closer they are to wolves, the better.  ",Happy
923,Yeah i like them to. Well you have a good evening.,Happy
924,Hello. Have you ever seen the movie Smallfoot? Apparently it's an animated fantasy about a Sasquatch type of character.,Curious to dive deeper
924," Awe, I have watched it a bunch of times with my kids. Its really cute and has Tatum Channing as a voice actor. When it's adult time I like to watch basketball though. I like King James.",Curious to dive deeper
924,Oh nice yeah I like basketball too. LeBron James is definitely the king. I can't wait to see him in the upcoming space jam movie.,Happy
924," Oh that will be fun, I remember MIchael Jordan in the first one, I think. James raised more than 6 million for charity in the past. Hes a great guy.",Curious to dive deeper
924,Yeah he raise that money by televising his decision on where he was going to play next. Pretty sure he did that.,Happy
924," Yeah, super cool. Its funny because Judge Judy is the second highest paid celebrity only to Lebron. She get s$123,000 per episode.",Curious to dive deeper
924,Well she makes a ton of money I have never actually watched her show. Even back in high school he drew a lot of attention to himself. Over 1000 people would attend his games.,Surprised
924," Yeah, he even had his highschool games cost $120 bucks a ticket! I love Judge Judy, watch her all the time,lol.",Curious to dive deeper
924,Ha ha nice maybe I should watch it sometime. LeBron James even rejected $10 million from Reebok when he was only 18.,Surprised
924,Yeah right! He was smart enough to see into the future and know he could get even more money. Since he gives to charity he has been blessed.,Curious to dive deeper
924,Yeah I think you are right. It was good he waited since he got way more from nike.,Happy
924," Yeah, exactly. I guess NIke gave him $90 million dollars! Thats crazy money.",Surprised
924,Yeah he is definitely set for life. He is also an amazing basketball player and he recieved four NBA most valuable player awards.,Neutral
924," Yep, very cool. I have been studying and trying to learn more about my computer lately and found out that if I smoke near it , it will void the warranty. Apple says it becomes biohazard. lol",Curious to dive deeper
924,Oh wow well I guess that makes sense. Apple seems to know their products quite well. Someone want to build a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic Minecraft building blocks. I wonder what that look like?,Curious to dive deeper
924," Oh man, I dont know. I heard that transhumanists want to upload their minds to computers and their memory onto memory sticks, sounds like a movie to me?",Curious to dive deeper
924,Yeah that sounds exactly like a sci-fi movie. In fact I think they made a black mirror episode about that. The space shuttles general purpose computer runs on about 1 MB of RAM. Doesn't seem like a lot.,Surprised
924," Yes, that doesn't seem like anything at all really. We have come so far.  ",Surprised
924,Agreed. The Russians have also made some advances themselves. In 1936 they made a computer that ran on water.,Surprised
924," Yeah, water! Thats amazing. I learned that humans lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago,  that reminds me I need to get ready for the gym. I wish I would lose all my hair and I could get ready quicker,lol.",Curious to dive deeper
924," Ha ha I couldn't even imagine having body hair all over my body like that, I'm glad we lost it back then. Apparently there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans, but I don't know if I have ever heard it. Very nice chatting with you have a good day.",Curious to dive deeper
925," Migo is a funny yeti, fun movie by Warner Bros Pictures",Curious to dive deeper
925,I missed that movie.  I need to see if I can catch it. It sounds awesome!,Neutral
925," It has great actors, well voices, Channing Tattun and James Corden are the voices of some of the characters",Curious to dive deeper
925,I heard there are some intellectual jokes in there that are fairly masked.,Neutral
925," Yeah I cant recall any of them now but yeah, the movie had good punch lines, interesting plot, reviving Bigfoot",Curious to dive deeper
925,So is it about a Yeti searching for a Yeti?,Curious to dive deeper
925," Well in the movie Bigfoot, Sasquatch and the abominable snowman are real and they think we are a myth, so its the other way around for them",Curious to dive deeper
925,Ahh.  I missed that movie too.  lol  That makes sense.,Neutral
925," Its a really funny movie,do you like LeBron James? I think he was also a part of the movie",Curious to dive deeper
925,Was he really?  That is cool. I hear he is going to star in the Space Jam sequel.,Neutral
925," Yeah, he is, so it will not be his first film, I am excited about that Space Jam sequel, ",Curious to dive deeper
925," I loved the one the MJ, I hope it can live up to the hype.",Neutral
925," I hope that too, well Warner Bros is going to produce it so I bet its going to be good I wonder what othere players will be in the movie as well",Curious to dive deeper
925,Maybe Steph Curry?  He seems to be pretty popular on the basketball scene.,Neutral
925," He is another popular player yeah and Cobey maybe even Jordan, he could make a guest appearance",Curious to dive deeper
925,I think it would be great if Jordan was in it too!,Neutral
925," I know right, having Jordan in the game would attract many fans, well I know LeBron will, people are crazy about him",Curious to dive deeper
925," He has certainly done well for himself.  He has switched teams frequently, that has caused some problems for some fans.",Neutral
925," He sure has, he is the highest paid celebrity right now, he sure earns a lot of money",Curious to dive deeper
925," Definitely, he even waited out a deal from Reebok for 10 mil, to get 90 mil from Nike within a year!",Surprised
925," That was a smart move, he won a lot of money by doing that. ",Curious to dive deeper
926,Channing Tatum was in Smallfoot.,Happy
926," I've not seen this movie, have you?",Curious to dive deeper
926," No, James Corden is also in it.",Happy
926,Sounds fun! looks like Lebron james is too.,Curious to dive deeper
926," Yes, it's about a himalayan yeti named Migo.",Happy
926," Did you know that Humans (taxonomically, Homo sapiens) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina.",Curious to dive deeper
926," Interesting, they also have erect posture and bipedal locomotion.",Happy
926,high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals;,Curious to dive deeper
926," Also, open ended and complex use of language compared to other animals.",Happy
926," I wonder if this is right? Several of these hominins used fire, occupied much of Eurasia, and gave rise to anatomically modern Homo sapiens in Africa about 315,000 years ago.",Curious to dive deeper
926,Fun! Did you know Lebron James raised 6 million dollars for charity.,Happy
926," No idea! humans began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity around 50,000 years ago.",Curious to dive deeper
926,What a long time ago. Humans also use tools better than any other animal.,Happy
926,also a larger brain!,Curious to dive deeper
926,The russians made a computer that ran on water. They must have big brains also.,Happy
926," :) Humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago.",Curious to dive deeper
926,Humans can also regrow a rib in 3-4 months of having it shortened.,Neutral
926,What? Are you joking?,Curious to dive deeper
926," No, very true. Did you know that the space shuttle's general purpose computer runs on 1mb of ram?",Surprised
926," I did know that! Did you know Judge judy makes $123,000 per episode, making her the highest paid celebrity only after lebron james.",Surprised
926," Wow, I wish I were her. She has a great show and is very rich.",Happy
927,hi do you like dogs?,Curious to dive deeper
927,I love dogs . THey have 12 blood types?,Curious to dive deeper
927,Yeah and there are blood drives for dogs,Curious to dive deeper

927,Wow that is a very fitting name for that cat for sure,Curious to dive deeper
927,Yeah. THere are more tigers living as pets in the US than there are in Asia in the wild,Curious to dive deeper
927,That is pretty sad. Roosevelt had 20 pets including a bear and hyena.,Curious to dive deeper
927,Yeah and in Japan there are more pets than children under 15,Curious to dive deeper
927,No way. Do you know how many individual animals are out there?,Curious to dive deeper
927," Yes a number that I do not even know how many zeros is has, 20 quintillion",Curious to dive deeper

928," Hi, do you like baseball?",Happy
928,Hi! I love baseball as well as kickball aka soccer-ball as they call it in Canada. Ha! What about you?,Happy
928," I like baseball and all sports in general. And you know what, I used to play kickball as a kid!!",Happy
928,That's awesome! I couldn't believe that the Japanese baseball fans were surprised to learn baseball is America's national pastime. I'm equally surprised to learn they were surprised,Surprised
928,That is a suprised cycle! Did you know why baseball managers dress in uniforms during a game?,Happy
928,It's because they actually can play if needed. Can you imagine an old manager out there catching fly balls in the outfield? That'd be hilarious! Ha!,Neutral
928," Yes, LOL, and I don't remember that happening! did you know what a very lucky man found in his grandfather's attic?",Happy
928," I heard it was $3 million worth in old 1900s baseball cards that were hidden there since the 1940s. It's like, I need to start checking attics then! Ha!",Neutral
928,You never know what you ca find!! Nice hidden inheritance from grandpa!!,Happy

928,Wow I have to try that! And also reading the javanese alphabet which forms a poem too!,Happy
928," I'd like to read that one. Also, Demetri Martin once wrote a palindrome poem that was 224 words. That is pretty interesting!",Neutral
928," Yes it is! Talking about arts, do you like ballet?",Happy
928," I do, actually. In fact, I think it's interesting that pro ballet dancers often go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes weekly. How about you?",Neutral
928," I love ballet too! and i was surprised of how many pairs of shoes they use!! they should probably get 5000 year old shoes, because they work better than modern shoes!",Happy
928," No kidding? I should invest in a pair of those old shoes, then. Ha! But if they're that old, we may want to drop a dry tea bag in them to absorb the nasty odor. Ha!",Neutral
928,hahaha that is right . Have you heard of what NFL player Steve Smith does after every game?,Happy
928," Yeah, I think it's a great thing he does leaving his cleats on the field to help raise awareness of the homeless who have no shoes. That is very kind of him!",Happy
928,It is! well I think it has been a nice chat! I did learn some cool stuff,Happy
928," Agreed as I have as well! And I'll leave you with one last cool little fact about Stephon Marbury: he promoted a shoe line that retailed at $15 even though he wasn't paid to endorse them. That was pretty cool of him to do. Well it was great chatting with you! Take care, friend!",Neutral
928," I did enjoy the chat, Yo do the same!!",Happy
929,Hello! Are you into baseball?,Happy
929," Yes, I love baseball and you?",Neutral
929,Sure! Gotta love a game where you get to use a bat!  Have you ever played?,Happy
929,I have played softball. I go to a lot of games. Very interesting a 17 year old female pitcher was banned from professional baseball.,Neutral
929," Really? I wonder why? Was she a softball pitcher trying  to play baseball, or was she and overhand thrower?",Curious to dive deeper
929,No she struck out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in succession. Love the catching a ball in your hat deal!,Neutral
929," Nice. If you can beat her, ban he from the game! In Canada, they callkickball by the name, Soccer-baseball. I wonder if that game is integrated?",Curious to dive deeper
929," I don't know, 160,000 is a lot of ball for a baseball season.",Neutral
929,Yup. and 2430 is a lot of games for one married couple to schedule every year!,Happy
929," lol, yes it is. Wow, 9th century high heels were worn by persian cavalry soldiers.",Neutral
929," Fashion trends come and go, but that is ridiculous! Were they endorsed by Stephon Marbury? He promoted those 15-dollar shoes which he was not paid to endorse, so, why not 9th-century high heals too?",Happy
929," ha ha ha, I know. Do you tie all of your shoes the same way since there are 17 ways?",Surprised
929," I use Velcro, and fasten it the same way each time!  So, why is it that professional ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of ballet shoes every week, but you never see big endorsement deal for ballet. shoes?",Happy
929," That makes sense, must no money in it. I don't think I would want someone to break in my shoes for me like Queen Elizabeth.",Neutral
929," I would let her break in my shoes, as long as she brings tea... You know, 5000 year old shoes designed perform better than modern shoes? They don't make them like they used to!",Happy
929," lol, just the thought of it. Interesting about the Vikings were war poets!",Neutral
929," Poet warriors?  The pen is mightier than the sword, but a good poem will put all your opponents to sleep! There is a poem that, when read normally is depressing, but when read backwards is inspiring? How bad must a poem be to be improved by reading it backwards?",Happy
929," Really! Its not depressing to me. I love poetry!  Very interesting Art, music and poetry were once olympic sports! ",Surprised
929," Now the best poets are rap artists. You know, almost all of the Hobbit characters were taken from an old Icelandic poem?  Dvergatal. Say that ten times quickly!",Happy
929," Yes, I've heard of that before. Have you heard of the poem Chaos?",Neutral
929," No. But did you know that if the Javanese alphabet is recited in order, it forms a poem?",Happy
930,Hi. Have you heard about paleo or gluten-free diets?,Curious to dive deeper
930,I have.  I have done a paleo diet a few times.  How about you?,Neutral
930," Never tried, but heard that these diets may not be useful for children & teens (?)",Curious to dive deeper
930," It depends, I think they are sustainable if done correctly.  But it may deprive them of things they need to grow.",Curious to dive deeper
930," Paleo is low or no-carb, right?",Curious to dive deeper
930," It is natural carbs, so no refined things or bread/wheat.  Carbs from fruit/nuts are ok.",Neutral
930," Can you eat proteins, like meat/fish, that youth would need, too, for energy?",Curious to dive deeper
930,Yes.  It is a protein/veggie rich diet.  No dairy either.,Neutral
930," Sounds like a diet some would try to lose weight. Are processed foods out, too?",Curious to dive deeper
930,All processed foods are out.  I have been successful with weight loss on it before.,Neutral
930,Wonder if kids may end up eating more processed foods on a gluten-free diet. Could that happen?,Curious to dive deeper
930," Not usually, gluten free usually cuts out a lot of the processed foods, especially carbs.",Neutral
930," Okay. How do you replace the fiber, iron, calcium?",Curious to dive deeper
930," A lot of those can be found in vegetables, and meats.  Paleo is essentially a if you could hunt or gather it you can eat it.",Neutral
930," That's easier to understand. Meat, fresh fruit, veggies. Aren't there good - or slow - carbs in some veggies and fruits?",Curious to dive deeper
930,There are.  Most natural things have slow carbs so they dont spike blood sugars.,Neutral
930," Right. Wouldn't this type of diet cut diabetes, especially teen diabetes?",Curious to dive deeper
930," It could sure help, the processed foods and sugars are what leads to weight gain and often diabetes.",Neutral
930," I see. The old ""Let them eat cake"" poor advice. If kids cut out milk, what about bone growth?",Curious to dive deeper
930," I think it would be fine with a veggie rich diet, and with fruits.  There are ways to get nutrients other than just milk.",Neutral
930," Do you wonder that too many kids are influenced by celebs like Miley Cyrus or Marie Osmond, who have promoted certain diets - for a fee?",Curious to dive deeper
930," I am not shocked many celebs will do anything for money.  Its a shame many of them dont actually sue the diet they promote.  Anyway, nice chatting!",Neutral
931,What do you think of the Paleo diet for kids?,Curious to dive deeper
931," Hello! I think there should be some restrictions but not low carb if it's a good carb, Gluten free is good though I think.",Happy
931,yeah I don't think they necessarily need to be on a low carb diet.  Gluten free isn't bad if they have health reasons for needing to do that I suppose,Surprised
931,I think kids tend to take diets to the extreme sometimes. Not good because they need balance since they are growing.,Happy
931," Yes, I believe we should focus on feeding them healthy whole grains, fruits and vegatables and that way they will grow to choose better choices",Happy
931,Yes. good carbs fuel the brain and give you energy which kids need a lot of. They need a vast variety of these vitamins and minerals.,Happy
931,You want them to appreciate food and healthy food choices so they won't have a unhealthy relationship with food when they are older.  If we are always having them on a diet as a kid then they might go crazy and make bad choices later on in life,Curious to dive deeper
931," Exactly, and with all the celebrity influence it's vital they learn from parents what a healthy way of life and eating is not just about your size and shape.",Happy
931,I agree.  speaking of celebrities..Robin Williams in Aladdin was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films,Happy
931,That's very interesting! Did you know Miley Cyrus' real name is Destiny Hope? I like that better.,Happy
931," yes that is actually really pretty.  She also has a nickname of ""smiley""""",Happy
931,Yes! That's why she goes by Miley lol very cute. Her Godmother is Dolly Parton too that's awesome.,Happy
931,That is pretty neat.  Her brother is also famous.  He is the lead guitarist and backing vocal in metro stataion,Surprised
931," Wow, that family is talented for sure! Her Dad Billy Ray has been very famous as well but I haven't heard about him in awhile.",Happy
931,yeah they starred in the Disney Channel show Hannah Montana,Happy
931,I know and it seems so many of today's talent has come from being in t.v shows. and many from the Disney channel.,Happy
931,I know thats true.  She was also in a film called Big Fish,Surprised
931,Was she? I didn't know that. It's crazy that her hit Wrecking Ball was co written by 5 different people. She has had many hits.,Happy
931,Also party in the USA was originally written by Jessie J and intended for Jessie J,Surprised
931,Right? It's funny how things work out. Just like Eminem originally was going to be a comic book artist....I am sure he's happy now that he followed his  alternate dream,Happy
931,in 2001 a michigan judge delivered her ruling in the form of a rap when trying a suit filed against him,Surprised
931," Really? haha, I would have liked to have heard that! Eminem has had an amazing career. Tupac has music is in the library of congress.",Surprised
931," yes that had to be funny.  Korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle, it called ""compliment battle""",Surprised
931,That would be cool to watch. So many different styles these days! It has been great chatting with you!,Happy
931,yes you too,Happy
931,Have a happy New Year!,Happy
931,you too,Happy
931,Thanks!,Happy
932,Good morning. Do you like Lord of the rings? I think J.R.R. Tolkien was a brilliant English writer.,Curious to dive deeper
932," Actually, I do not. I don't even like the movies. I do think there is a fan among astronomers, though. As the moon, Titan's mountains are named after Middle Earth.",Surprised
932,Oh yes that is a cool fact. I like Middle Earth but I like our earth even more. I think it's so cool that the gravitational interaction between the earth and moon cause the tides.,Happy
932,It's saddening to think that over 80% of our forests have been destroyed.,Sad
932,Yes it truly is. When Earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long.,Surprised
932,It's insane to think that the UN has an ambassador for extraterrestrials.,Surprised
932,Yes I'm surprised it took them so long to be honest. They only appointed one in 2010.,Surprised
932,I wonder if that is why Jeff Bezos built his clock in the mountains of Texas?,Curious to dive deeper
932," Yes maybe he was so happy that he wanted to do something to commemorate that event. Do you think it will actually run for 10,000 years?",Curious to dive deeper
932," As long as there are enough hikers winding the key each year. However, it's a lot longer of a hike, than the 15 miles some warehouse workers walk each shift. ",Curious to dive deeper
932,That's a lot of walking. Especially since they have to work on Sundays because Amazon has a contract with USPS.,Surprised
932," I love getting my packages on sunday, lol. I wish I was the first customer, so I could have a building named after me.",Happy
932,Yes that would be so cool. And it only cost a customer $27.95.,Happy
932," I didn't know that IMDB was owned by Amazon, did you?",Curious to dive deeper
932,Yes but I didn't know that they acquired it back in 1998!,Surprised
932," That is amazing. Elizabeth Warren is wanting to break up Amazon, as it's the largest internet retailer in the world. I wonder if she will be successful in doing so?",Curious to dive deeper
932," I don't think so. She is crazy. We will always be a capitalist country. Amazon wouldn't allow it. They have film studios, a publishing arm, and much more.",Curious to dive deeper
932," Amazon has no say in the matter, and this country has  a history of going after monopolies. I think their customer service is slipping though, maybe they do have too many arms to keep the quality up. Their independent programming for their studios isn't the greatest.",Neutral
932,Yes that's a good point. Amazon does have a say in the matter. Politicians get paid off all the time and our country has a long history of this. I am not saying Amazon does this but it's possible. Well it was nice chatting with you.,Curious to dive deeper
932," You obviously don't know how the anti-monopoly stature works. If that were true, AT&T would never have been broke up, nor would the steel industries, and banks. Amazon has a publishing arm as well, there are a lot of books on the subject, you should check out a few.",Neutral
932,I understand what you are saying and I understand there exist anti Monopoly stature but if it was 100% effective than there wouldn't be any monopolies when in fact there are. Do you know how many tech companies monopolize certain geographical areas? I will definitely read more about it. Thanks for chatting this morning.,Curious to dive deeper
932," Again, that's not how it works, lol. It's a fascinating subject. Check out a few books on the ""Robber Barrons"".",Neutral
932,Ok I definitely will thanks for the recommendation! Have a good one!,Curious to dive deeper
932,Bye.,Neutral
932,Bye!,Neutral
933,Good morning! Do you ever shop on Amazon?,Neutral
933," Yes, I love it!  It was founded by Jeff Bezos on July 5, 1994",Curious to dive deeper
933,Hard to believe it's been around so long! For some reason it feels new to me.  You know it started out as just a bookstore?,Neutral
933,Really thats interesting.  The first customer spent $27.95 and got a building named after him.,Surprised
933,He's a lucky man! And a smart one for buying from what was an unknown company at the time that turned in to the powerhouse it is today.,Neutral
933,did you know that the United States Postal Service has a contract with amazon to deliver packages on Sunday,Surprised
933," I did know that and to me, it just says exactly how powerful amazon is.  As far as I know, they are the only company that has that contract.",Neutral
933,I think so.  I also saw that the workers for Amazons warehouse walk b/t 7 and 15 miles each dday,Surprised
933,Well that's a good thing. It's a great way to get exercise and make money at the same time!,Neutral
933,LOL exactly.  Did you know that Amazon passed up Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the United States,Surprised
933," I believe it. I shop at Walmart but I like to shop online.  Truth is, Amazon ships UPS and Walmart doesn't.  Amazon gets stuff to you in a day or so.  Walmart doesn't do that either.",Neutral
933,Exactly I prefer Amazon.  I just do Walmart for groceries.  I saw that Amazon is the third most valuable public company in the United States.,Surprised
933,I guess that Google and Facebook are probably the top two.  Amazon might just move up though. They've got their own film and tv studio now.,Neutral
933,Actually I read that they are behind Apple and Microsoft.,Surprised
933," Really?  Well I'm wrong lol!  Well still, they might move up anyways!",Neutral
933," Yes, they might.  They are the largest internet company by revenue in the world",Surprised
933,And right behind Alibaba in total sales.  I wonder if that's due to the population size of China.,Neutral
933,It might be.  I also saw that after Walmart they are the largest employer in the United States.,Surprised
933,What do you think about the cashless stores they are starting up?,Neutral
933,Well I guess most people dont carry cash so it makes sense.  I was reading that IMBD has been owned by Amazon since 1998.  I didn't know that,Surprised
933," I didn't know that either.  Sounds like amazon got into expanding early on. They were only a 4 year old business when they did that.  Well, I've got to go for a bit.  It's been nice chatting with you!  Have a great day!",Neutral
934,hello,Curious to dive deeper
934,Hello,Happy
934,Have you heard of El Chapo?,Curious to dive deeper
934,I have heard of El Chapo but tell me more.,Curious to dive deeper
934,well his wife just through their daughter a huge Barbie themed party as he sits in jail,Surprised
934,Was that the one where the daughter had a pink themed party?,Curious to dive deeper
934," Yes it was.  .  They had pink flowers, pink cakes, pink couches, etc",Curious to dive deeper
934,That's really crazy. I saw that they had a carnival ride and a pink themed splashed party room.,Curious to dive deeper
934," switching topics, did you know that in Nevada, the US government owns 86% of the land.",Surprised
934," Yeah, I heard something like that. It's crazy that the government could own that much of the land. Reminded me of when wikileaks published the government plan to ruin wikileaks.",Happy
934," Yes, I remember that. I also remember the us passed legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the geneva conventions in 2006",Curious to dive deeper
934," That's right they did do that. That was such a shame like when a man in France managed to impersonate the government and tell the Eiffel Tower, not once but twice.",Curious to dive deeper
934,Did you know the actor Ricky Gervis was a pop singer in the '80s?,Surprised
934," No I did not, but I did remember that ""We are the Champions"" was rated as the catchiest pop song of all time by scientists.",Happy
934,That is cool.  Its also funny that the Indonesia president has 3 pop albums.,Surprised
934," Haha, that president is truly living the life. Switching subjects, do you know much about Lebron James?",Curious to dive deeper
934," Yes I know a lot, including many consider him the greatest basketball player of all time.",Curious to dive deeper
934," He does have an extensive amount of awards including four NBA MVPs, three NBA FInals MVPS and two Olympic gold medals.",Happy
934,I heard he has partnered with Warner Bros to do a Space Jam sequel.,Curious to dive deeper
934," Wow, a Space Jam sequel would be great. I hear he even gets paid more than Judge Judy.",Curious to dive deeper
934," well, thanks for chatting.",Neutral
935,Are you familiar with El Chapo?.,Curious to dive deeper
935," Oh, sure. I heard his daughters got thrown a Barbie party. I wonder if his kids know what he does for a living.",Curious to dive deeper
935," Yeah, apparently he was a drug king pin. ",Curious to dive deeper
935," I know his older kids know, as some of them were involved with him, but I always wondered about children of drug king pins and mafia members, etc. His twins are only seven years old.",Sad
935," Yeah, pretty interesting. I think he was found guilty recently wasn't he? ",Curious to dive deeper
935,I have not heard. There is outrage because his wife is hosting parties with alleged drug money.,Angry
935,I believe it. It is hard to prove that it is actual drug money likely though.,Curious to dive deeper
935," Yeah, it is hard to prove. He (do I have to say allegedly since you say he was convicted?) ran a billion dollar narcotics empire and actually controlled the American illegal drug supply. There were a lot of dead bodies.",Curious to dive deeper
935," Probably, it reminds me of Pablo Escobar. Same type of deal. Bad dude.s ",Curious to dive deeper
935,I heard the government has failed to pocket any of Chapo's gains.,Surprised
935,It wouldn't surprise me. Did you know that a 2012 study concluded that Pop Music has grown louder?,Curious to dive deeper
935,Louder and more homogeneous. I'd say more hideous haha.,Surprised
935,Interesting. Did you know Warner Bros signed a deal with King James for Space Jam.,Surprised
935," Cool. I look forward to seeing it. Lebron doesn't only make money for himself, he raises millions for charity.",Happy
935," Yeah, he's a great player, but I wish he would have stayed with his original team. ",Curious to dive deeper
935,He kind of always knew how good he was. He rejected a $10 million dollar offer from Reebok because he thought he could do better. He was right. A year later he got a $90 million offer from Nike.,Surprised
935," WOW, but typically Reebok isn't the way to go if you ask me. ",Curious to dive deeper
935," Ha, from a business standpoint or style? I really don't like those shoes!",Curious to dive deeper
935," Both, LOL! Did you know Judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode? That is insane! ",Curious to dive deeper
935," Haha, that is pretty awesome! Is she really the highest paid celeb after Lebron?",Curious to dive deeper
935," I think so, that is surprising to me. Well, nice chatting with you. ",Surprised
936,What do you think about El Chapo?,Curious to dive deeper
936,I honestly think he's a snitch when a person goes to court they have to agree on their legal defense's strategy. HE chose to point out he wasnt the true leader of the group instead he pointed at a man who is 70 years old an has never been caught before names Ismael mayo zambada.,Curious to dive deeper
936," Snitches get killed terribly, so I unless he isnt afraid, he committed a lot of crimes, he is a smart man though,",Disgusted
936,He is very smart indeed. But I think mayo is smarter he didn't get caught trying to film a dumb movie about his life with sean penn after escaping and he made it to the old age of 70 years old by flying under the radar.,Surprised
936," I  guess he is smarter than El Chapo, still escaping like two prisons in the way he did, being the leader of the cartel after being only a poor farmer",Curious to dive deeper
936,He never was the actual leader... This is how he snitched he pointed out the old man as the true leader. Chapo wouldn't have tarnished his legacy if he would have just chose to remain quiet and loyal to end and not snitch. This is what makes pablo escobar a much bigger figure since he was never actually caught he only turned himself in to his own prison he built. They had to kill pablo to catch him.,Happy
936," He was not? I must have my facts wrong then, maybe he pointed the old man because he wanted to divert attention away from him, and yeah Pablo made a similar mistake, he wanted a political career and that was the beginning of the end for him",Curious to dive deeper
936,If you have time watch the documentary on chapo's life on netflix you'll understand alot more. And watch the newest season of narcos they show that chapo was from the younger generation he started out working under the old mustaches,Happy
936," I guess I will watch it now, its an interesting story, has changed a lot of thins, it seems like El Chapo is not a violent person, he never said a bad word or acted violent according to Coronel",Curious to dive deeper
936,Maybe he knew that violence only brought more problems so he only used it as a tool when it was necessary to defend himself,Curious to dive deeper
936," Yeah he does seem like a quiet person, do you follow the government much?",Curious to dive deeper
936,Yup I'm constantly on google news looking at whats happening in the government daily,Surprised
936," I think its important to keep up with the news, you know that 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the government!",Curious to dive deeper
936,So do you think most of the city of las vegas is probably government owned too?,Curious to dive deeper
936," I dont think so, that is mostly private companies but who know I might have to Google that, maybe the own everything but Vegas lol",Curious to dive deeper
936,It would make so much sense they are just taking in all that casino money lol,Happy
936," It would, the government should donate more money to important causes then, just like the Norwegian government the donated $1 billion to save the rainforests",Happy
936,We definitely need something like that especially since our current idiot president doesnt even believe that climate change is real,Happy
936," Yeah he should take a look at the glaciers, did you hear about the plan the government had to destroy Wikileaks, ironic",Curious to dive deeper
936,They can plan as much as they want lol wikileaks will never go down there are already back ups of the site in different countries in case something happens it will go right back up from a server in some remote island lol,Happy
936," They must be a pain in the government ass lol, I think its a great service, why hide the truth, the truth will always come out. ",Curious to dive deeper
937,Hi! Don't youjust love the government? LOL,Happy
937," hi how are you? ""love"" um that is not the word i would use. the govt tests my patience. LOL",Neutral
937," Whatever could you mean? Don't you just love their decisions, like choosing to own 86% of Nevada? How could yo question their common sense?",Happy
937,I wonder what the govt does on that land. alien landing sites? secret experiments?,Neutral
937," All good reasons to devote our national resources!  Perhapws your opinion of givernment officials is somewhat jaded by the imposters out there, selling the Eiffel Tower and such... But not all government is inept...yet....",Happy
937,I want to meet the guy that sold the eiffel tower. i want to meet the people he sold it to.,Neutral
937," Right?!  What kind of a box do you think they will need to carry home that purchase?  We, I for one am encouraged by the actions of some governments, like the Norwegian gov, who donated $1 billion to save the rain forests!  I think they plan to put it in millions of small Ziplac freezer bags where it can stay frssh onger!",Happy
937," LOL. yes, norway makes a lot of money from oil. i think they are worried about its impact on the environment. it is a rich country too",Neutral
937," Greedy, oil-crazed governments...no wonder WikiLeaks is paranoid!  They have published the government's plans to destroy WikiLeaks. I am comforted by that. Not that we know it is a governmental priority, we know it will never happen!",Happy
937," I dont know what to expect from govt at this point. there is so much money in there, it no longer seems like a govt for people like me.",Neutral
937,Don't be fearful little one!  LeBron James is here to protect us...right after he finished up promoting Space Jam!,Happy
937," Space jam? another space jam movie? well, i guess people want to see lebron in a movie.",Neutral
937," People will pay money watch Lebron clean his nostrils.  Some of his High School games were sold out 1750 capacity evens running at $100-150 per seat.  Yes, there is an audience for him...",Happy
937,LOL true. they love anything he does. and who got the money for those tickets? lebron? i doubt it.,Neutral
937," At least on occasion money finds it's way to the needy. LeBron televised his ""decision"" and gave the $6 million raised to charity.",Happy
937,he has been quite generous off the court. he donated money to help kids go to college too.,Neutral
937,Nice. Maybe he uses some of that $90 milion he got from Nike to do some good in the world?,Happy
937," yeah, a lot of the players dont do that. they blow their money and often end up broke after they retire. it is sad.",Neutral
937," It is. And then, before too long, the appear before Judge Judy, the second hiohest paid celebrity, behind LeBron, and get to tell their sad stories to the world.  ",Happy
937," True LOL. Anyway, great chat! see you on judge judy!",Neutral
937,No if I see you first!  I am going to watch old videos of Ricky Gervais as a pop singer... Now that's entertainment!,Happy
937," LOL. yes, i should watch myself. i could easily end up on JJ. Have a good day!",Neutral
937," I'll leave you with this: Scientists have voted that ""We are the Champions"" is the most catchiest pop song of all time. Nerds would know!",Happy
938,There is a cabaret that wants to ensure that Elvis' songs and music are taken seriously.,Curious to dive deeper
938,I was never a big Elvis fan but my Uncle was.,Neutral
938,I liked some of his songs but I was not a big fan.  So perhaps your uncle would like to see the cabaret show entitled Entirely Elvis.,Curious to dive deeper
938,I wasn't very interested given its mix of country and gospel,Neutral
938,What are you interested in?,Neutral
938," I like the classics but not country, more of the rock classics",Neutral
938,Do you know that Bellamy holds the guiness work record for smashing guitars?,Curious to dive deeper
938,how many?,Curious to dive deeper
938,The article did not say.  I am curious myself.   It just says that the musician holds guiness world record for smashing guitars.,Neutral
938,I almost smashed the one I bought to learn how to play with but I stopped myself and just turned to learning to play drums instead,Neutral
938,I played drums when I was at high school.  I did not know that guitar had six strings.,Curious to dive deeper
938,Both electric and traditional have six strings?,Curious to dive deeper
938,I believe both types have six strings. My fingers hurt when I tried to play guitar.  I gave up.,Neutral
938,How did guitar players tune their guitars before the days of apps and the internet?,Curious to dive deeper
938,They must have done it manually.  I prefer to play piano instead.  I did not know that this instrument was invented in Italy.  I thought it was in the US.,Surprised
938,The piano is one of the more beautiful instruments in my opinion,Neutral
938," I agree with you.  when BBC had no news on April 18, 1930, they decided to broadcast piano music.",Neutral
938,I wish they would still do that. they would be broadcasting a lot of that these days with nothing too important going on,Neutral
938,I totally agree.  I am tired of bad news.  The sound from an acoustic instrument would be pleasant.,Neutral
938,I listen to Mozart pretty frequently when feeling stressed,Neutral
938,It must be very relaxing.  I need to do that too.  Perhaps English people are more calm on the old days when BBC decided to broadcast piano music instead of news.,Neutral
938,Time for some piano practice for me.,Neutral
939,Do you take Elvis' music seriously?,Curious to dive deeper
939,I do. He has some great music and was a great entertainer.,Curious to dive deeper
939,Someone is putting on his music cabaret style to showcase his music.,Neutral
939," I'm sure some people will like it and others won't. Either way, it will help his songs stay alive and showcase how truly original he was.",Curious to dive deeper
939,Yes.  They claim that there is a rawness to his music that really hits home.  Several of his songs are like that to me.,Neutral
939," The mix of the songs make it that way I think...country, gospel, blues. All different in a way but pretty cool when put together.",Curious to dive deeper
939," That makes sense.  I never thought of it before, but his blues songs were not pessimistic.",Neutral
939,I didn't know that he did not write many of his songs. He only took the songs and changed the arrangements to his liking.,Curious to dive deeper
939," But either he or the Colonel picked some that are just right.  For others it would be fatalism, but he made the Heartbreak Hotel sound like a place I would want to visit.",Neutral
939,I agree. His originality and unrestricted way of singing and performing definitely made him the best.,Curious to dive deeper
939,He accused someone of being nothing but a Hound Dog.  Did you know dogs have 12 different blood types and can donate blood at blood drives?,Neutral
939," Uh, I did not know that. For real? I mean I know they are man's best friend but....",Curious to dive deeper
939," Some people will spend on their pets.  Dogs and elephants are the only animals that instinctively understand pointing.  If an elephant every charges you, point in another direction!",Neutral
939," I didn't realize they were super intelligent. They can learn over 1,000 words and reason better than chimpanzees. Crazy, right?",Curious to dive deeper
939," That's a lot of words.  I have seen smart dogs, but not one that had been that trained.  Google prefers dogs to cats and states in their code of conduct that they are a dog company",Neutral
939,That's cool. Cats are so temperamental. Did you know dogs drink with the underside of their tongues?,Curious to dive deeper
939,No.  I did not know that.  I once read that cattle do not bit grass but wrap their tongue around it and pull on it.  Dogs also cannot see as many colors as humans do.,Neutral
939,I am glad dogs and humans associate well together. Dogs are very helpful to us in so many ways and to so many types of people. I really appreciate their care for the disabled.,Curious to dive deeper
939,That,Neutral
939," Also, how they help law enforcement specifically and are even given titles just like human officers.",Curious to dive deeper
939," I hit the wrong key last time.  Sorry.  I was going to say That's why they are called ""Man's best friend""  Thanks for carrying on!",Neutral
939,I figured that! Maybe I should get a dog. Nice chatting!,Curious to dive deeper
939,I have had a couple and really enjoyed them.  Likewise!,Neutral
940,Hi do you have an interest in planets?,Curious to dive deeper
940," Hello, I love space and planets. Did you know that a moon of JUpiter's could be a planet if it rotated around the sun?",Curious to dive deeper
940,Nice that is awesome. I believe that is it's moon Ganymede.,Curious to dive deeper
940,Yes that is it. ANd Venus does not even tilt like others,Curious to dive deeper
940,Yeah and that is the reason why there are no seasons there,Curious to dive deeper
940,Yeah and it is also the only planet that rotates clock-wise.,Curious to dive deeper
940,Yeah all sorts of cool with Venus. There is another planet where it precipitates shards of glass,Curious to dive deeper
940,Yeah heard about that and it does so at 4500 mph in 2000 degree Fahrenheit. Scary,Curious to dive deeper
940,That is super scary indeed. Astronomers have found building blocks in another planet,Curious to dive deeper
940," Yeah but that is really far away, like 455 light years away. Interesting though",Curious to dive deeper
940,Yeah that is. Uranus also rotates sideways and does not spin like the others,Curious to dive deeper
940,So awesome. DO you know much about the government?,Curious to dive deeper
940,I know some stuff. DO you know what wikileaks is?,Curious to dive deeper
940,Yeah that is the website that reveals secrets of the government,Curious to dive deeper
940,Yeah and they once published documents showing how the government is trying to destroy them,Curious to dive deeper
940,Yeah. Did you know the government owns 86% of the land in Nevada?,Curious to dive deeper
940," That is a lot and I wonder what they do with all that land, most of it is just a desert anyways",Curious to dive deeper
940,True. A man in France once managed to sell the eiffer tower twice,Curious to dive deeper
940,Yeah he must have been really good at impersonating state officials,Curious to dive deeper
940,Yeah indeed. THe Norwegian government donated $1 billion to save e the Amazon,Curious to dive deeper
940,I hope that helps somehow because it is heading for a great destruction at this rate,Happy
941," It's interesting how sometimes Americans joke about moving to Canada due to our politics, yet sometimes Canada's politics make just as much sense as ours",Curious to dive deeper
941," Canada has many politics, but probably not as many as the US. The US has too many politics. What is climate change anyhow?",Neutral
941," Climate change is the more updated term for what used to be called ""global warming."" Canada is starting to put policies into place that they believe will help with the said issue, but most aren't sure why, it seems",Neutral
941," I guess it's tricky. I would like to see some progress, but people seem reluctant to change. Plus, will it raise taxes?",Curious to dive deeper
941," It raises tax on anything that produces carbon, in most cases. Which includes gas, of course",Neutral
941," In 1975 the Soviet Union successfully sent a spacecraft to Venus, and captured the first images from the surface of another planet. Did the colonists survive? Is there a secret base on Venus? Do they have to worry about climate change there? Maybe we should communicate with them about carbon taxes. ",Curious to dive deeper
941," I'm not sure, because Venus doesn't experience seasons due to the lack of tilt in the axis. It also rotates clockwise, which might affect some things. I think seasons are what make people paranoid about climate change",Neutral
941," Maybe we should outlaw seasons. Canadia has a prime minister, right? Could we talk to the PM?",Neutral
941," I think so. It's a strange setup. Seasons aren't something that can be outlawed, but rather something that occurs naturally. I can't imagine what it would be like living on Uranus. It actually rotates sideways and looks like it's spinning compared to other planets",Curious to dive deeper
941," I just found out that the Canadian PM serves at her majesty's pleasure, so the post does not have a fixed term. In a survey, 51% thought the prime minister was directly elected by Canadians. I wonder if the Queen has ever ejected a prime minister from the game of thrones. Can the Queen do something about seasons and climate change? She might be busy though.",Curious to dive deeper
941," It is a strange position, indeed. The Queen is old enough to know whether our current weather is actually a problem that needs to be addressed or rather a natural cycle, right? I wonder if the same applies to the PM of Australia. Technically, the position isn't even in their constitution, but they were owned by England",Curious to dive deeper
941," I dream of moving to Uranus to get away from these sorts of politics here. But the Internet connection is probably slow. Plus climate change would follow me there, I suppose.  Does Australia have climate? Do they have Internet?",Curious to dive deeper
941," Everywhere has a climate of some sort, but some are milder than others. And of course Australia has the internet. If you move to Japan instead, you'll get a silver cup from the PM there if you make to 100",Neutral
941," Is there a connection between climate change and Internet? The Chinese government has censored the word 'censorship.' Could they censor ""Climate change"" well and be done with that? Could the Japanese invent a clever device to make climate change less expensive or faster?",Neutral
941," None of these governments can actually control the weather. Well, they do try. Like how the Norwegian government donated money to help save the rainforest in the Amazon. But that's less climate change and more man using natural resources",Neutral
941," The Norwegians probably bought a bunch of snow and shipped it down to the rainforest to cool things off. Thoughtful, but ultimately futile. ",Neutral
941," They don't have to buy snow. They could just ship the snow they already get. I wonder if it's actually possible to buy the Eiffel Tower. There was a man who managed to sell it twice by impersonating a government official, but it may not even be a good investment",Curious to dive deeper
941,The Eiffel Tower is romantic but does not have enough parking. Did you know that Andrew Bonar Law is the only person from outside the UK to ever become the prime minister of the UK? Why did his parents saddle him with such an awkward middle name?,Curious to dive deeper
941," Maybe it's French? Of course the British wouldn't make it a requirement to be born there, unlike Americans. You can't be President unless you were born on US soil",Surprised
941,What if you were born on the moon? That would be unfair. What if the moon were right over the US at the moment of your birth?,Curious to dive deeper
941," What if you were born on Jupiter's moon Ganymede? It's not technically a planet, but it's big enough to be if it decides to orbit around the sun instead. Oh, the things we may never know",Curious to dive deeper
942,hi how are you over there?,Neutral
942,I am enjoying my location on planet earth. You?,Happy
942," my location is pretty good. happy to still be on this planet. its a good planet, i think.",Neutral
942," As far as astronomical bodies is concerned, it is a good one. Not like the ones that are too small to allow their own gravity to round them out!",Happy
942," cubic planets look cool but they really are not fun to live on. plus they dont hold their value in the real estate market. What is up with uranus though? Uranus actually rotates sideways and ""rolls"" around the sun rather than spinning like the other planets.",Neutral
942,Don't you get embarrassed when someone talks about Uranus? I do. Some consider planets as divine emissaries of the deities. Pretty cool.,Happy
942,i would think that uranus is the source of many things. i do not see divine emissaries emerging from it though.,Neutral
942," The planet Venus doesn't tilt. What's up with that?  I say, come on Venus, live a little!",Happy
942,venus already suffers a terrible reputation. better to stay on the straight and narrow. the word venerial comes from venus. living a little has gotten venus in trouble.,Neutral
942," Yeah, but even Jupiter has a moon on the side--a big one named Ganymede--and she is not even a planet!",Happy
942,that uppity ganymede has gotten too big for its britches. there is a place for everything and ganymede has its place.,Neutral
942," Of course, some planets you do not want to cross paths with.  Like that one that rains shards of glass down at about 4500 mph in 2000 degree heat!  Now that is jealous fury!",Happy
942,that is a planet in need of therapy. maybe an intervention? why all the noise and rage? it does not change anything but it does get you some attention.,Neutral
942," Well, insecurity can cause a lot of personality complications. Some celestial bodies are not even recognized as planets, and that can leave a chip on one's shoulder...",Happy
942," so many of these so-called planets do not deserve the distinction. when they make their linkedin page, they bandy about the term planet pretty freely, its boastful.",Neutral
942," True, but self-image is important to self esteem. Think of poor Pluto. Once considered a plant, and now completely disrespected. I think it is becuase of his/her status as a trans-neptunian object. Am I wrong?",Happy
942,pluto never understood interplanetary politics. there is a whole game to play. you gotta know the right people. it is not plutos fault. so far away. its not fair.,Neutral
942," Maybe if Pluto bands together with former planets like Ceres, Pallas, Vesta and Juno, then they can find power in numbers? If they play it right, they could band together with the Kuiper belt and not even be considerd a minority anymore!",Happy
942," in the celestial game of thrones, pluto would have to become a tyrion lannister. not an easy thing for one so small and distant. then again, pluto has money.",Neutral
942," Much care must be taken, lest a heavenly battle ensue.  And in such a war, planetary mass can make all the difference.",Happy
942," we can promise a promotion to full planetary status to ganymede, who is too stupid to know that cant possibly happen. anyway, great chat!",Neutral
942,I genuflect before thee.,Happy
943,The dog is domestic animals which is long associated with human. Which is helpful in many way to safeguard their place and cattles.,Curious to dive deeper
943,Good morning.  How true.  Do you own a dog?,Curious to dive deeper
943," Have a great day. Yes, two dogs. What about you?",Happy
943," I have 4 dogs, but I live in the country, so they have lots of land to run and play.",Happy
943,Its very interesting. The dog population is estimated around 900 million and keep increasingly around the world. They are help to human in many ways.,Happy
943," Yes, they do help humans and that's alot of dogs, for sure.  I hear in Istanbul they have a system for their stray dogs to get food and water in exchange for recycled plastic bottles.  That's so cool!",Surprised
943," The Domestic dog are mostly carnivore, some of them are omnivore. They are used for hunting and rearing cattle.",Happy
943," Yeah, I would agree about the omnivore part, my lab will eat almost anything.  Shoes, newspapers, etc.  I think she could probably even eat a can if I gave her one!",Happy
943,Dog are not colour blind but they can see limited colour only they have colour blindness like humans.,Curious to dive deeper
943,That's interesting to know! I always wondered that about my dogs.  I wonder what my dogs' favorite color is now?,Surprised
943,It is very interesting. Do you play any musical instrument ?,Curious to dive deeper
943," As a matter of fact, I play the guitar.",Happy
943," Guitar is a type of chordophone, which is made up of wood string are made up nylon.",Happy
943," I guess that is one description for a guitar. lol I've played since I was a child and I'm no Eddie Van Halen, but I'm a pretty good player.  Do you play?",Curious to dive deeper
943," Electric guitar was introduced in 1930, use an amplifier and speaker to produce the sound to make the audience to hear.",Curious to dive deeper
943," Yeah, that's what Eddie Van Halen was playing when he set the speakers on fire when recording his solo for Michael Jackson's song, ""Beat it"".",Neutral
943," Pink floyd guitarist turned a ""grand houseboat"" on the river thames.",Curious to dive deeper
943,That's nice.  Do you play piano?,Curious to dive deeper
943," No, I see it in musical shop only. Do you have it.",Curious to dive deeper
943," No, I never learned to play piano.  But, I would like to learn.",Curious to dive deeper
943," In 1930, Digital piano was introduced.",Curious to dive deeper
943," Cool, I don't think I have ever heard of that type of piano, before. Did you know the Hindenburg had an aluminum piano?",Curious to dive deeper
943,Somewhat. Digital piano don't have any strings or hammer. They use digital sampling technology through which the sound is produced it is very accurate.,Curious to dive deeper
943,How interesting.  Well it's been nice chatting with you.  I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.,Happy
944,Hi! Do you like animals? I especially like dogs because they can donate blood at dog blood drives! I haven't tried yet though.,Surprised
944," I just learned that! They have 12 different blood types, which I think is more than humans, but I'm not sure.",Surprised
944," That is definitely more than humans! They can also perform many roles for humans such as hunting, herding, protection, but I mainly have dogs for cuddling.",Happy
944," I had always thought that dogs were completely color blind, but apparently they can see color, just not as many colors as humans can. Wish I had a dog to cuddle :(",Neutral
944," Do you have other pets? I didn't know they can see color! My dog certainly acts like he can't distinguish colors but like elephants, he can understand pointing.",Surprised
944," I have a cat! She is such a good climber :) I know Google doesn't prefer her, but I definitely do.",Neutral
944," Cats are really cute too! Google definitely is a dog company, they even have it in their code of conduct! That's kind of lame, does that mean people can't bring cats to work?",Curious to dive deeper
944," I read it and I think it means they don't have a position on the subject. Like, they started by professing their love for dogs over cats but then said people should be mindful when choosing to bring dogs to work. So no rules about cats... :)",Happy
944," Oh ok! I would totally love to work for Google some day, the environment and culture seems so fun and hip! They even offer music rooms filled with guitars and drums! Probably to vent out some frustrations and stresses",Surprised
944," If you want to vent frustration, just become a musician and get away with destroying guitars on tour ;) Matthew Bellamy from Muse has the world record for most guitars smashed on tour, so you've got a lot to live up to.",Neutral
944," Good point! Now I wonder if he was stressed, trying to set a record, or look cool, I think if I were to smash guitars, it would probably be for the latter and then after knowing someone beat my record, I would smash more guitars to vent out my frustrations.",Surprised
944," I'd rather smash office printers and things that frustrate me by malfunctioning. If I were a touring musician, I'd be more like...Brian May. I'd use coins as guitar pics, have amazing hair, and just be chill lol",Happy
944," If I could get away with it, I'd definitely smash some of those too haha. Coins as guitar picks, now that's different! Those must be the successful musicians, well at least Pink Floyd turned a grand houseboat on the river into a floating recording studio called the astoria that's when you know you've made it!",Surprised
944," Yep, Queen is very successful (and my favorite band). The weird thing is their first huge hit was Bohemian Rhapsody which is when they ""made it."" But even when just recording it, they got to use the same piano as was used for Hey Jude. It was like foreshadowing.",Surprised
944," Did you see Bohemian Rhapsody then? Oh wow, yeah that's pretty cool! Wonder how much pianos weigh on average, because an aluminum grand piano weighed only 356 pounds for the lounge of the airship HIndenburg.",Surprised
944," Must've been the same one that someone hauled to the top of a mountain in the UK somehow. Yep, I saw the movie. It was as good as any biopic.",Neutral
944,Rami Malek really did a great job of impersonating Freddie Mercury! Wonder if they played the song composed solely for stress testing auto-pianos while on set since I don't think the actor plays the piano.,Curious to dive deeper
944," He did a great job, but they over-did his faux overbite. And yeah, he had never played piano before when he auditioned!",Neutral
944," Oh yeah, that was a bit annoying. Do you play any instruments? I would love to learn how to play the guitar or piano, probably the guitar because it's portable and I can show off my skills",Happy
944," I used to know how to play the flute when I was 10, but didn't stick with it :/ I actually have always wanted to learn the piano",Neutral
944," I learned the flute as part of band in high school but was never good at it, I think I still have it in my attic somewhere, probably needs a deep clean. Me too! The piano sounds so melodic, the BBC even broadcasted piano when there was no news worth reporting",Surprised
944," That's a broadcast I would listen to. As the Talking Heads once said, ""When I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed. Say something once, why say it again?""",Happy
944,That's a great quote! I think broadcasting music is better than 'gap fillers' like some news stations do with nonsense news.,Happy
944," Did you know there's a song that's composed entirely of silence? It's called 4:33 (it's four minutes and 33 seconds of silence) and is meant to highlight how important silence is to music, like negative space is to art",Curious to dive deeper
945," hi, do you use the computer much?",Curious to dive deeper
945," I always use my computer, maybe too much. ",Neutral
945,yeah me too i think. the space shuttle uses one that runs on one mb of ram,Curious to dive deeper
945," In the 80s, 1 mb ram was really big. It would be the equivalent of 10 Gb of ram today. ",Neutral
945,yeah. did you know russians make a computer that runs on water,Curious to dive deeper
945," It is probably to cool them, they always produced a lot of heat even in the times of Ada Lovelace, the first programmer. ",Neutral
945,yeah that is true. did you know transhumans are trying to upload their minds to the commuter?,Curious to dive deeper
945," I would not surprised that it is a Google project, it is so big now. ",Neutral
945," yeah, we will have to wait and see I guess. do you have an apple or a PC?",Curious to dive deeper
945," I have a PC, and you  ?",Neutral
945,I have an apple. Good thing I do not smoke otherwise I can void its warranty,Curious to dive deeper
945,Why would it void the warranty ? Computers don't have lungs.,Curious to dive deeper
945,I am assuming it is because it is a fire hazard,Curious to dive deeper
945," Are you sure ? Computers don't burn easily,  they are made to be hot because they consume so much power, Google uses 0.01 % of all worldwide electricity. ",Curious to dive deeper
945,yeah that is amazing. a single google search also requires more computing power than sending armstrong ad other astronauts to the moon,Curious to dive deeper
945," They had weak computers at the time, but google has a good sense of humor about the moon, in the early versions of Google Moon,  pictures of cheese were used when you zoomed at the maximum. ",Happy
945,haha that is funny. do you know how they calculate traffic?,Curious to dive deeper
945," No idea, they go outside and check for cars ? ",Curious to dive deeper
945,actually they track android devices and see how fast they are moving,Curious to dive deeper
945," That is smart, but it is expected for a company founded by PhD. students. ",Neutral
945,true. nice chat,Happy
946,Do you like baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
946,I love baseball!  I also like baseball cards.  Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
946," Not as much as when I was young, I like to play though.",Curious to dive deeper
946," If I recall , the Honus Wagner baseball card is the most valuable ever.  But once a man found $3 million worth of 1900s cards in his grandfather's attic!",Surprised
946,I have some from the 70's and 80s that my fathers store did not sell.  Many in mint!,Curious to dive deeper
946," Wow, you might be rich without even knowing it! ",Surprised
946,I should check huh?  Did you know managers can technically play?,Curious to dive deeper
946," I did hear that.  Interesting. I wonder if baseball rules are the same in Japan, where it's an incredibly popular sport? ",Surprised
946,They should have a game with US managers vs Japanese managers then haha.  Wonder why they  run counter clockwise.,Curious to dive deeper
946," Haha.  YOu know how, when a baseball player plays particularly well, he tips his hat to the crowd? That originated from knights in the olden days, raising their face visors to show friendliness.",Curious to dive deeper
946," I have seen that...cool.  Canada is confusing, they call Kickball, soccer-baseball?",Surprised
946," I know! Speaking of hats, did you know that in the old west, the most popular hat was a bowler (not a cowboy hat)?  I can't picture Billy the Kid in a bowler!",Surprised
946,I did not know that....Im sure if the person was riding a horse they would get more weather protection from a cowboy hat.,Curious to dive deeper
946," I would think so also. I know hats can be decoratvie and fashion statements, but they seem most useful as protection.  But there are lots of reasons why people wear hats.",Curious to dive deeper
946,Some are signs of rank in military or police,Curious to dive deeper
946,True or for religious purposes like turbans the Sikhs wear.,Curious to dive deeper
946,I wear a hard hat sometimes...our engineers have a variety of decorations on them lol.,Curious to dive deeper
946," LOL I wore one when I graduated college. It wasn't a dunce cap, either! LOL",Happy
946," Is that a real thing, a dunce cap? Must be a real fool to be made to wear one",Curious to dive deeper
946,Apparently it is. I've only seen them in cartoons.,Curious to dive deeper
946," Haha, I will have to google.  Nice talking to you.  Have a good one.",Happy
946,Nice to talk with.,Neutral
946,:),Happy
947," hey there, are you a fan of technology?",Curious to dive deeper
947,I do.  I love technology.  I would love to work for google.,Neutral
947,That would me amazing. YOu can maybe even play with the goats they hire to graze the grass,Surprised
947,I am not so sure about being referred to as a noogler and wearing a beanie cap!,Curious to dive deeper
947,Hahaha. Apparently a single google search uses more computing power than sending Armstrong and 11 others to the moon,Surprised
947,That is absolutely crazy.  I guess that is why google's data center uses about .01% of all total worldwide electricity,Curious to dive deeper
947,It would explain a lot. It once went down for about 5 minutes. Imagine if that was longer?,Surprised
947,I love the fact that g-mail used to be a free email server on Garfield's website,Happy
947," Oh that is funny. Interesting thing about the borders and google maps too, adjusting them to what each country says",Surprised
947,I did not know that.  Computers are amazing things and it is crazy to think about how much they have evolved since the 60s.,Neutral
947,Yeah. the computer in charge of the space shuttle has a ram of only 1mb,Surprised
947,Right  and now everything from a microwave oven to a remote control has a computer in it!,Neutral
947,exactly. someone even built a 16-bit computer using only minecraft building blocks,Surprised
947,And the first computer algorithm was written by a woman named Ada Lovelace.   She had a programming language named after her,Neutral
947,It is said we do not know more about these people who built the foundations of important things,Surprised
947,Absolutely. I love the fact that the first google computer at Stanford had enclosures made of Legos!,Happy
947,We have come so far from those days. Do you have much interest in the galaxy?,Curious to dive deeper
947,I do find stars interesting.  It is fascinating to consider stuff from outer space,Curious to dive deeper
947,Venus is the only planet that does not tilt to it is stuck with only one season all the time,Surprised
947,Wow that is interesting.  I knew the Soviet Union sent a spacecraft to Venus in 1975,Curious to dive deeper
947,So much cool stuff. It was nice chatting with you.,Happy
948,Are you a fan of baseball by any chance?,Curious to dive deeper
948,Yes I watch baseball from time to time. It's interesting how both teams take turns batting and Fielding,Neutral
948,It is. Do you happen to know why baseball managers wear uniforms?,Curious to dive deeper
948," Yes I do, I think it's because they can actually play in the game if necessary right? Did you know that a seventeen-year-old actually struck out Babe Ruth? I wonder what became of her",Surprised
948,Yes it is. I did not know that. That's very impressive.,Neutral
948," There is a rule in baseball I'd never heard about though, have you heard about what happens if a player catches a baseball in their hat?",Curious to dive deeper
948,I have not. What happens?,Curious to dive deeper
948," Yes if you catch the ball in your hat then you will get three bases actually, that's actually really good they should try that more often in games",Surprised
948,I had no idea. Did you also know that baseball in insanely popular in Japan?,Curious to dive deeper
948," I did know that I think that the stadiums are a lot more fun in Japan as well, what do you think about the Chicago Cubs by the way? They actually won the first World Series back to back",Curious to dive deeper
948,It's so popular that they are shocked that it's America's past time. They had a very long lull after that until recently.,Neutral
948," Yeah that makes sense. Did you hear about the fact that the MLB will typically use about 160,000 baseball's a year",Surprised
948,I did not. I knew it had to be a lot but I would not have guessed that high. Do you know the alternate name for kickball in Canada?,Curious to dive deeper
948,Isn't it called soccer baseball LOL that's a really dumb name. on a different note though do you ever watch the news,Curious to dive deeper
948,It is. I do watch the news sometimes but I get more of my news from newspaper apps.,Neutral
948,Yeah I mostly get my news online too. But it is funny to me that the Simpsons was making fun of Fox News so then they were going to sue them LOL,Surprised
948,Wow! That's ridiculous. They would never be successful with parody laws anyway.,Surprised
948," No I don't think so. But what is also interesting is that Fox News tried to make a conservative Daily Show television show, but it was cancelled after only 13 episodes",Surprised
948,They certainly are not known for their comedy so I am not surprised. Did you know that it was created by Republican media strategist Richard Ailes and Richard Nixon?!,Surprised
948," No I didn't know that. Did you also know that the median age of viewers for Fox News is 68, that is pretty old",Surprised
948,I'm not surprised by that either. Especially when I see who is posting things they would do on Facebook.,Neutral
949,Do you use google or bing?,Neutral
949," i use google most of the time and very rarely use bing.  Do you use them?  Hey, did you know google was founded back in 1998?",Neutral
949," Google sure has come a long way as a company that specializes in internet related services and products, they even dabble in self driving cars now",Neutral
949,They really have.  I heard they use android devices for the google maps to calculate traffic. They track how fast phones are moving.  This really surprised me for some reason. I guess I just thought they had a satellite in orbit watching roads lol.,Neutral
949,I mean google often goes the extra mile. A single google search uses more computing that it did to send men to the moon!,Neutral
949,I'm going to think about that every time I google a recipe!  So many people use google nowadays.  It went down once and took down 40% of web traffic with it.,Neutral
949,They also tailor google maps to the claims of the respective country. Way to go the extra mile,Neutral
949,How do they do that?,Neutral
949,They do it based on where the internet browser is located and knowing the country's border claims,Neutral
949," Really?  That is going the extra mile.  Speaking of going the extra mile, I do know that Google used goats to mow their lawns in order to help the planet.",Neutral
949,I bet that doubles down to fertilize the grass too lol,Happy
949,I bet it does too!  I like pro environment activity.  I am really not a big fan of apple but they do consider smoking near their products a biozard and make it void the warranty.,Neutral
949," True. In any case, what kinds of things do you search on google?",Neutral
949,Oh recipe ideas and gardening ideas. i also search about space.  i found out that Jupiter has a moon that is large enough to be a planet.  What do you search?,Neutral
949,Do you enjoy looking up information about planets? Did you know Uranus rolls around the sun rather than spinning like other planets?,Neutral
949,I do and I do know that.  It's crazy and funny when you think about how it must look.  Uranus has more character than Venus.  It doesn't tilt so it doesn't have any seasons.,Neutral
949,Well that doesn't sound as bad as the planet that has shards of glass precipitating sideways at 4500 mph,Neutral
949,True.  You know I feel sorry for Pluto.  I still think of it as a planet even though scientists changed their minds and said it's not.,Neutral
949,Well even the definition of planets is subjective so perhaps pluto maybe a planet once more.,Neutral
949,It does seem odd the way planets are chosen. They are chosen based on where and what they orbit.,Neutral
949," True. In any case, thank you for the enjoyable and informative chat. I hope pluto become a planet again since I miss making a solar system without that small ping pong ball",Neutral
949,I hope it does too as well as Ceres and Pallas. They too were once planets and now not.,Neutral
950,Do you like baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
950,Hello!  I love baseball!,Happy
950,Did you know that baseball is so popular in japan that many fans are surprised to discover its status as america's national past time.,Surprised
950,Interesting.  A man once found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in his grandfathers attic.  Talk about hitting a gold mine!,Happy
950,I can not imagine what that must have felt like! I wonder if he sold them all or kept them.,Curious to dive deeper
950,He probably sold them.  How could someone pass up getting that much money?  Up until 2005 a married couple scheduled all 2430 MLB games played each year for 24 years.  That's a long haul.,Happy
950,I can imagine scheduling that. I wonder how much they were paid?,Neutral
950," If they did it for 24 years, I'm guessing they made enough to make it worthwhile.  Although I knew someone who was a big baseball fan and they took a part time job working at a concessions stand at the Cleveland Indians stadium just so they could be around the vibe of the ball park.",Happy
950,I love it. Baseball games have such good and happy vibes for all ages.,Neutral
950,Yes. I've been a fan my whole life and played as long as could up through college.  Do you know why baseball managers wear uniforms?,Happy
950,I learned that they can actually play in the game!,Surprised
950,Yes.  That would be interesting to see wouldn't it?,Happy
950," I always thought they looked silly dressed like that,",Surprised
950,lol  Do you watch Fox news by any chance?,Happy
950,Not really but i know its watched more than cnn and msnbc combined,Curious to dive deeper
950,I know Richard Nixon played a role in creating Fox news.  I didn't even know it existed back then.,Happy
950,I wonder if that was before he was president?,Curious to dive deeper
950," I'm not sure.  The gaming website IGN is owned by News Corp., who also owns Fox news.  I've never used that site for games.",Happy
950,I hope you have a good day.,Neutral
950,One more quick question.  Do you know what the most popular hat was in the old west?,Happy
950,no what is it?,Neutral
951,Do you have a Facebook account?,Curious to dive deeper
951,I do have an account but I do not use it too much anymore. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
951," I have an account as well and use it ever week, so a bit more frequently, Facebook is now worth $104 billion",Curious to dive deeper
951,I wonder if there will be any major changes after all of the privacy and data usage issues came to light.,Curious to dive deeper
951,I have no idea about that what I can tell you is that Facebook is blue because the creater suffers from color blindness,Curious to dive deeper
951," That's interesting, I never would have guessed that just based on the color scheme.",Surprised
951," It is interesting and I know right, I thought it was blue because it was an strategy or a psychological thing to lure subscribers, turns out the answer is a lot more simpler",Curious to dive deeper
951,Yes I always seem to dig into deeper meaning that the real answer.,Curious to dive deeper
951,Did you hear about that promotion Burger King had? the one involving the free whopper and Facebook,Curious to dive deeper
951,Yes I remember that coming up! I seriously considered unfriending people but there isn't a Burger King close by me.,Happy
951," Thats too bad I unfriended some and ate my free whoppers, easier meal ive ever gotten, Facebook has such an impact, even on other countires",Happy
951," I've never talked to anyone who got the free whoppers, I applaud your decision. I think it was a great marketing campaign since people still talk about it.",Surprised
951," I think it was as well, Iceland is rewritting their constitution via Facebook, maybe Burger King can stop that by bringing their free whoppers promotion over there",Curious to dive deeper
951," I wonder if they even have a Burger King, I'm sure they do but it's not a very large country and I feel like they are pretty health conscious from my research into traveling there.",Curious to dive deeper
951," You traveled to Iceland? it must be a really nice country and yeah Burger King isnt a healthy choice so maybe they dont have one, they sure have Facebook accounts and place a lot of value on them",Surprised
951," I have not made it there yet but I have been exploring it. I recently booked a trip to Paris, Amsterdam, and London.",Happy
951,You must love to travel then?,Curious to dive deeper
951,I have begun to really make it a priority. There are so many places I want to visit.,Happy
951," I love to travel as well, the world is a big place with a lot of places to visit but changing the subject, theres a funny fact about Elmo, do you  want to know what it is?",Curious to dive deeper
951," No I do not, what is it?",Curious to dive deeper
951," Well he is the only non human to ever testify before the US congress, I think thats really funny, how can that be",Curious to dive deeper
952,Are you a facebook user?,Curious to dive deeper
952," I am, Are you?",Curious to dive deeper
952," Yep, I have decreased my use as of late, but still using it. Have you heard of burger kings former promotion?",Curious to dive deeper
952," No! I had no idea, but I'm sure I could've taken advantage of that. I still use it almost daily, but have already decreased my friend list for privacy reasons.",Surprised
952," Right, I don't like what they are doing for privacy! I wish i could delete 100 friends to get 10 whoppers!",Curious to dive deeper
952," I've got myself down to 85 friends, and still sometimes feel like that's too much. Did you know about Iceland using Facebook to rewrite their constitution?",Curious to dive deeper
952," Nice I think I am just at 200, I have a big family. Do you know facebook is blue because zuckerberg is color blind",Curious to dive deeper
952," No, I didn't know that - but can totally understand why he did it that way. Also I had no idea the 'like' button is illegal in Schleswig-Holstein in Germany. I'm just glad they have other reactions now besides 'like.' ",Surprised
952," That needs to be liked lol. I feel that is illegal in general, what do you think. ",Curious to dive deeper
952," Having a like button? I don't know about illegal in general, but it certainly makes for a situation where only folks who agree with you tend to make their voice heard. My friends list is extremely divided between liberal and conservative friends, and they don't tend to talk to each other because of how polarized the discussions are. Do your friends tend to have heated discussions on facebook or stay quiet?",Curious to dive deeper
952," I have some friends that say a lot on facebook and some that argue. I sit behind my computer and what the awkwardness unfold and stay quiet, you?",Curious to dive deeper
952," Lol, I'm so quiet that I tend to never post or even react to anyone's comments, but I guess I still want to have a Facebook and see what people have to say. I have a particular friend who always shares news articles, so it's like the only way I get the news anymore.",Neutral
952," Right, I like facebook for the news and seeing my family members grow up and such. Did you know myspace could have bought it in 2005",Curious to dive deeper
952," I bet they're kicking themselves for letting that deal go by, huh? Is Myspace even still in existence?",Curious to dive deeper
952," I doubt it lol, last I heard Justin Timberlake part owned it lol.",Curious to dive deeper
952," I agree. I'm actually surprised to learn that Facebook has 2.2 billion active users, I just thought that with 7 billion people in the world, more would be on Facebook. I wonder if the other people use something different in their part of the world. I'm not sure what to do when my kids get old enough for Facebook - I feel like 13 is too young to be responsible with an account. What do you thinK?",Curious to dive deeper
952," 13 is too young I think, but it is hard to say no. I wonder out of the 2.2 billion users, how many people have multiple accounts, cat fish accounts, or business accounts.",Curious to dive deeper
952," Oh man, I didn't even consider that. I went off Facebook for 7 months a couple years ago when I realized that of all my friends, none of them lived within a half hour's drive of me. Do you find that Facebook takes the place of real life, face-to-face friendships?",Curious to dive deeper
952," It totally does, that is a good idea. I quit once for like 2 weeks and I needed my fix after that two weeks, quite sad. It was so nice chatting with you, have a great day and weekend!",Curious to dive deeper
952,You too! Thanks for the chat!,Neutral
952,Bye!,Curious to dive deeper
953," Do you follow tennis much, or have a interest in the game?",Curious to dive deeper
953," Hello there, I don't follow too much but think it is a very exciting sport.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
953," I have a passing knowledge and know some of the big names like Nadal, Federer and Murray.",Neutral
953," Yeah those are some of the current greats, I heard Nadal injured his knee recently as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
953," He is always hurting himself, I believe it is the way he plays, he runs so much more than some of the other players.",Sad
953," Yeah and at the age of 32 and still competing for titles, I say he has had a good career. ",Curious to dive deeper
953," He still does very well, he is the current French Open champion, he hardly ever loses when he plays on clay courts.",Happy
953," That is very impressive, I think if you are still playing pro sports past your 20's you are doing pretty good. ",Curious to dive deeper
953," He has always relied on his mobility as a player, he's not such a great player of the ball like Federer, but he will keep chasing it.",Happy
953," That is true.  Speaking of tennis, did you know that until 1978 a player was allowed to use any object as a racket?",Curious to dive deeper
953," If that were still true I might try to find something very big and light to use.  I think tennis is interesting as it is played on different surfaces, hard, grass and clay, and each has it's own style.",Surprised
953," That is very interesting, and I'm sure players have their own personal preferences for each. ",Curious to dive deeper
953," They do, Nadal rarely loses on clay, Federer rarely loses on grass.  The ball moves slower on clay and you can run after it more.",Neutral
953," Very interesting, I would like to try to play on a clay court one day and then a grass one, see the difference for myself. ",Curious to dive deeper
953," I've played a bit on concrete at the local park, but only for fun with the kids. My kids typically like electronic entertainment.",Curious to dive deeper
953,Oh yeah and especially kids these days i'm afraid are more and more electronic only entertainment.,Curious to dive deeper
953," My son loves his game console, an Xbox.  They are so much better then the old Nintendo's.",Happy
953,Oh yeah but those old nintendos with the 54 colors were tons of hours of fun!,Curious to dive deeper
953," It probably doesn't really matter how many colors you have, I was happy with Pong at the time and that had just 2.",Happy
953," Right, it's all about the gameplay and that type of thing, but I think kids would notice the lack of colors today. ",Curious to dive deeper
953," I'm shocked that the Nintendo was discontinued as long ago as 2003, doesn't seem that long ago that it was the in thing.  Good talking to you.",Surprised
953," Yeah and it was one heck of a run!  Nice talking to you as well, have a good day. ",Happy
954," Hi, how are you?",Happy
954," I'm doing well, you?",Curious to dive deeper
954," Very well, thanks. Did you know The Nintendo entertainment system could display only 54 colors.",Happy
954,I think it was called Nintendo 54 at one point. That must be why. It was discontinued in Japan in 2003.,Surprised
954," really! Nice...Bill nye ""the science guy"" got his break in entertainment by winning a steve martin lookalike contest.",Happy
954," He does look like him! Ronald Reagan got rejected for a movie because they didn't think he had a ""presidential look""",Surprised
954," The arrow through the head gave it away... Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player rene ""the crocodile"" lacoste and only later adopted by polo players",Happy
954," That's pretty cool. Speaking of tennis, only one man has ever won the US Open. That was in 1968.",Surprised
954,I did not know that. Im going to have to look into that. They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 us open,Happy
954,That was a great idea! The longest tennis match lasted 11 hours.,Surprised
954," I would need a nap! Us open quarterfinalist gael monfils beat the ""roger federer of paddle tennis"" after learning how to play just days earlier",Happy
954,Wow. Roger federer has been gifted two cows over his career for winning the 2003 wimbledon and the 2013 swiss open.,Surprised
954,What the hell do you do with a cow?,Surprised
954,Seriously! I wonder who gave them to him? Super weird!,Surprised
954," Us open quarterfinalist gael monfils beat the ""roger federer of paddle tennis"" after learning how to play just days earlier",Happy
954,Roger federer is the first living person in switzerland to be honored with an official stamp.,Surprised
954," I would love a stamp with me on it! In 2016, roger federer suffered the biggest injury of his career when he stretched too far while drawing a bath for his daughters and tore a meniscus.",Surprised
954,Haha. Figures! He has won 20 Grand Slam singles titles.,Surprised
954,That's a lot. Only 20 more than me...,Happy
954,Ain't that the truth! He was in the top ten from 2002-2016 and then again in 2017.,Surprised
954,Nice chatting with you.,Happy
955," Hi, ya. I guess a knee injury forced Rafael Nadal out of the U.S. Open semi finals. ",Curious to dive deeper
955,Yeah.  that is really sad.  He is such a talented player.,Neutral
955," Right, I know. Del Port said that its not the best way to win a match and that would have loved to play against Rafa because hes the biggest fighter in the sport.",Curious to dive deeper
955," It is never great having something handed to you at that level.  It is more fun to earn it, so I see his point",Neutral
955," Yep, I agree. I guess he typically doesn't like his knee taped up and his coach retaped it a few times and each time he tore it off. So eventually he had a limp and his speed was being effected and his knee was declining.",Curious to dive deeper
955,At least he believes he knows what is going on with it so he can rehab it faster,Neutral
955,That is true and a good point. I guess he has suffered with tinnitus  for a while now and he's 33 years old.,Curious to dive deeper
955,It was projected that he would have a short career too.,Surprised
955," Oh really, I didn't know that. He has proven people wrong with his work ethic and raw talent. Do you like any other types of entertainment?",Curious to dive deeper
955,I love old school video games!  You?,Neutral
955," Yeah, I loved playing Nintendo. The system was discontinued in 2003.",Curious to dive deeper
955,It is sad!  That was classic! Even though there were only 54 colors that was the best!,Neutral
955," Yeah, things have come so far now. It's almost unrecognizable. Entertainment has evolved and can be adapted to suit any scale now.",Curious to dive deeper
955," It really has.  Did you know someone once told Reagan he didnt look ""presidential enough""",Curious to dive deeper
955," What! No way! That is crazy, lol. Not presidential enough I wonder who made that call? It was a bad one.",Surprised
955," Yeah, they certainly didnt know what they were talking about.  ",Neutral
955,I was recently watching an old match with Roger Federer. He was an amazing tennis player. He was born in 1981 and was a Swiss professional player who ranked 3rd in the world.,Curious to dive deeper
955,He along with Nadal and Djokovic account for 56% of Grand Slam titles,Neutral
955," Man, that is something else. Wow, wait talent. It was in 2016 that Federer suffered the biggest injury to date and of his career. He stretched too far while drawing a bath for his child and tore his meniscus.",Surprised
955,That is kind of crazy for an athlete.,Neutral
955,Ya just never know when you may step wrong. Its very shocking though. I think its neat that they used to use a helicopter to dry the grass at the US Open tennis match.,Curious to dive deeper
955,I heard about that... kind of nuts.  Anyway Good chat!,Neutral
956," Hi how are you doing?  Did you know When caesar visited britain, around 50bc, he noted that its people bred chickens not for food, but for entertainment",Surprised
956," No. I can believe it, though. Chickens can be entertaining. I prefer watching Wimbledon, though.",Curious to dive deeper
956," Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player rene ""the crocodile"" lacoste and only later adopted by polo players",Curious to dive deeper
956," I'm a big tennis fan. Which player do you like more, Federer or Nadal?",Curious to dive deeper
956,I like Andy Samberg in 7 days of Hell.,Curious to dive deeper
956," I never saw that movie. I like the tennis player, Andy Murray, too. ",Curious to dive deeper
956,You should watch it.  I dont keep up with tennis at all. But I read They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 us open,Curious to dive deeper
956," Yes, that's pretty interesting. There were some great players back then and now. Federer has 30 singles Grand Slam finals. That's a lot! ",Surprised
956,Thats amazing.  Tennis games can be way too long though- The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days.,Curious to dive deeper
956," And, I think a four or five hour match is long! I can't believe Federer's worst injury came from giving his kids a bath. That sounds like something I would do! ",Surprised
956,haha right!  This is interesting Roger federer has been gifted two cows over his career for winning the 2003 wimbledon and the 2013 swiss open,Curious to dive deeper
956,That is so funny! He also is the only living person in Switzerland to have his face on a postage stamp. Not sure if having your face licked is a big honor or not!,Surprised
956,I would say thats a huge honor!  Even in America!,Curious to dive deeper
956," I would agree. Federer and Nadal play lawn tennis as opposed to ""real tennis"" which I guess is still played all over the world.",Curious to dive deeper
956," Us open quarterfinalist gael monfils beat the ""roger federer of paddle tennis"" after learning how to play just days earlier",Curious to dive deeper
956," That's insane. I have played pickleball before, which I guess is very similar to paddle tennis. I don't think I could be world champion in just a few days.",Curious to dive deeper
956,I cant be a world champion in anything in a few days!  thats insane.,Curious to dive deeper
956," I could be in taking naps. Nadal is only 32, and he already has international tennis titles. ",Curious to dive deeper
956," wow,  thats crazy.  Over achiever!",Curious to dive deeper
956,I guess so. He had to an end a match at the US Open because he had a knee injury. Tennis can be hard on the knees.,Curious to dive deeper
956," Absolutely!  It was great talking to you,  have a good one. ",Neutral
957,I never have seen a baseball manager take the field and play a position.,Surprised
957," I have never seen one either but it seems like its totally legal, ive always wondered why they wore the jersey as well.",Curious to dive deeper
957," Yes, most other games the coach is not dressed to play.  There seems to be something universal about hitting a ball with a bat.",Happy
957," I see, did you know baseball is also popular in Japan?",Curious to dive deeper
957," Yes, It is big there.  Seems odd that man Japanese fans do not know that baseball is called Americas past time. Japan is full of surprises. ",Surprised
957," It sure is full with suprises I agree with you there, you know a man found like a million dollars worth of baseball cards.",Surprised
957," Thats a good surprise.  Who could have predicted that some cards would become valuable.  I played kickball in school, should I make a card and see if it becomes valuable?",Curious to dive deeper
957," Probably not a good idea but who know it might be worth millions in a future lol, a married couple scheduled all games untill 2005.",Curious to dive deeper
957," That makes me wonder why they stopped.  I know that there are 2430 games of MLB played each year.  I am surprised, thats a lot.",Surprised
957," It is a lot! I would have thought there were a lot fewer games, do you like comedy?",Curious to dive deeper
957,Comedy movies?  I like that very much.  Though the term bromantic is not one I would use.  Harold and Kumar is a weedy film. Ha.,Happy
957," I liked that film, so funny! and do you know the comedian Ryan Stiles?",Happy
957," I do know Ryan.  He is on Whos line is it anyway, and in the old Drew Cary show.  Did he do the right thing to drop high school and pursue a career?",Curious to dive deeper
957," Apparently it worked out for him but I think it was the wrong choice, he is sucessful but school is important still.",Curious to dive deeper
957,I have never seen Kung Fu Hustle.  Bill Murry likes it.  Do you have an opinion?,Curious to dive deeper
957," I havent seen it but I heard its pretty funny, Do you know who Demetri Martin is?",Curious to dive deeper
957,No idea who Demetri is.  3rd rock from the sun beat Seinfeld and friends for a golden globe.  That is a surprise to me.,Surprised
957," Ok so Demitri is a comedian, he was accepted into Harvard and left because for him it was boring.",Curious to dive deeper
957," The worst time to have a heart attack is during a game of charades.  I would think, that leaving Harvard was a hard decision to make.",Neutral
957," I know but apparently it turned out to be a good decision, I know thats not the decision I would take lol",Curious to dive deeper
957,early silent films are nice in a way.  So simple so funny.  humor does not have to be words.,Happy
958," Hello, are you a music fan? I am. I adore Linkin Park, and attended one of the 2001 concerts.",Happy
958,I am. Did you enjoy their concert?,Curious to dive deeper
958," I did, (unlike the Creed concert that resulted in a lawsuit the following year) . I was saddened when Chester Bennington took his own life. ",Sad
958,I have been to Croatia before but regret not going to see the ancient amphitheater there,Sad
958," I've never been to Croatia. However I've been to Pompeii. Unfortunately, not the day Pink Floyd recorded there.",Happy
958,Have you seen Pink floyd in concert?,Curious to dive deeper
958," I have not. Only tribute bands. I prefer movies, and saw The Silence of the Lambs on Valentines Day when it came out in 1991.",Neutral
958," Silence of the Lambs is my all time favorite movie, then Saw.",Neutral
958," I didn't care for Saw. I like Disney,  but hated Treasure Planet. I wasn't the only one, since it was a huge flop.",Surprised
958,Box Office ticket prices are ridiculous these days,Disgusted
958,They sure are. Movies are so expensive to make. Tom Hanks has a draw of over 8.5 Billion. That's insane.,Neutral
958,I though you might have been watching the movie Silence of the Lambs there for a second...lol,Neutral
958," No, I wish, lol. It grossed 270 million when it came out. Not bad for an old movie.",Neutral
958," As popular as it seems, Disney considered Sleeping beauty a flop according to sales numbers.",Neutral
958," Imagine how the animation industry would be like today, had they have taken that route.Yet, Sleeping Beauty is one of the all time classics now",Neutral
958,Did you ever watch Trojan Wars. I thought it was a horrible movie and it flopped in the box office.,Neutral
958," No, I haven't. They had a huge budget too.",Neutral
958,I think the movie only made a couple of hundred of dollars in ticket sales,Neutral
958," I think so. That's awful. I thought Chappie was a terrible movie, and it did horribly in ticket sales too.",Curious to dive deeper
958,I wish they would do another remake of Silence of the Lambs; Red Dragon did not do it justice and missed the mark in my opinion at the box office,Neutral
958,I agree. It's hard to improve on the original though.,Neutral
958,I am going to go play my piano now. Thanks.,Neutral
959,Five new comic books does not sound like a lot.  I wonder what he will be paid?,Surprised
959,That doesn't sound like a ton but it seems like there are a lot of new characters so maybe it will be a really cool read.,Curious to dive deeper
959," Oh, I see, he wanted the experience of Bruce Wayne.  No plan for author Bryan Hill to buy the F430.  New characters?",Neutral
959,Yeah it looks like he added Black Lightning and Orphan. I think that Signal and Batgirl make an appearance too. Maybe it will be a fun short run of these characters together.,Curious to dive deeper
959,What does Signal do?  What is the super power?,Curious to dive deeper
959,I'm not sure. I think Signal is from the suicide squad which seems like an odd team up for Batman. But i guess he is kind of an anti hero in a sense.,Curious to dive deeper
959," It would seem that Hill is also trying to make political statements with comics.  Cant we just have some Bam POW , SOCKOW fun.",Neutral
959,That is the classic Batman that I knew growing up. I will always sort of think of Adam West as Batman. He is iconic.,Neutral
959,Yes Adam West on the TV show.  It was funny to hear his voice on the Simpsons.  Batman first appeared in DC comics in 1939.,Neutral
959,He actually has the logo of batman etched on one of his molars. Talk about dedication to the character.,Surprised
959,I wonder if Adam West knows anyone named Alfred.  It would be a fun joke for all of five minutes I guess.,Neutral
959,That would be pretty hilarious. Stick them all in New Jersey where Gotham City is supposedly located in the fictional universe and it could make for some hilarious jokes.,Happy
959,Think of the Christmas card the two could make. Alfred and I would like to wish you a happy whatever.  I wonder why the batman and the joker never refer to each other by name.,Neutral
959,Hmm that is very strange. I know in some comics they were friends before they became enemies. Maybe that is why.,Curious to dive deeper
959," What are you doing here batsy.  Do cute nick names count?  Must be a comics only kind of thing, not the TV show or movies.",Neutral
959,Must be. I wonder which Batman comic had the condiment king. I don't remember him as a villian. I can't imagine it was a very good battle though.,Curious to dive deeper
959," I do not know.  police commissioner Gordon might have been taken prisoner by a hot dog covered in ketchup.  What is more important, super powers or super tech?",Neutral
959,I'm hoping super tech because honestly if they made a super villian by dunking him in some radioactive ketchup or something that issue deserved to flop and never be known by most of the public.,Disgusted
959," The base for almost all the super heroes today came from the 1930's. To bad we dont have a modern hero.  Able to create power points with the click of a mouse.  Surfs web pages like they were water, its office worker dude.",Neutral
959,That would be really cool. Too bad Stan Lee passed. I could totally see him creating something like that.,Sad
959,Your radioactive ketchup might play a role in neutralizing the smell from the guy that microwaves fish in the office kitchen.,Neutral
959,There could be a whole thing of office themed comics. It would be fun if they broke the fourth wall like they do in the show the office. That could lead to some really funny situations.,Happy
959,There is a insurance commercial where people use office binders like armor.  They are gladiators.  It could be fun.  The manager would end phone calls with excelsior.,Neutral
959,Just like Stan Lee did! Well it has been nice chatting with you. Have a great day!,Neutral
960,Good morning. How are you?,Neutral
960," I'm doing well, how are you today?",Curious to dive deeper
960,Doing great. So are you a fan of the dark knight? I love Batman myself.,Neutral
960,I really liked those movies even though I am not the biggest Batman fan.,Happy
960," I guess its an acquired taste. I dont know, but adam west sure enjoyed his time as batman. He actually has a bat symbol on one of his molars.",Happy
960," That's pretty interesting, that's dedication to one of his roles. Did you read the Batman comics growing up?",Curious to dive deeper
960,No I didnt really read comics when I was a kid.  I dont even think I ever owned a comic book. Lol,Neutral
960,I read a lot of Marvel comic books but not a lot of DC comic books. That's why I am not the biggest Batman fan.,Neutral
960,Batman was created by bob kane and bill finger all the way back in 1939.That is pretty amazing that it is still popular today.,Happy
960,I think once you come up with a great story it will last a long time. Look at how many classic stories are still being remade into movies today.,Happy
960,I dont think the condiment king will be one that lasts. Lol,Neutral
960," There have been some real crazy Batman villains, did you see the Lego Batman movie?",Surprised
960,I havent saw that one. I saw batman in the original lego movie. Is it good though?,Happy
960,It was very funny and it had a lot of nods to all the weird villains they made throughout the comics history such as Condiment King and Calendar Man.,Happy
960,Ill have to check that out with my son. He will love that. I always thought gotham was supposed to represent New York. I guess it is supposed to be in New Jersey I guess.,Happy
960," I did not know that,I would have guessed New York as well.",Surprised
960,I guess batman and the joker never mention each others names in face to face confrontations. I didnt catch that whenI have watch batman.,Happy
960," That's also interesting, I wonder who Weird Al voiced in the Batman animated film?",Curious to dive deeper
960,I would say it would be joker maybe. It almost has to be one of the villains. I could see him as the joker or maybe the riddler.,Neutral
960," The Riddler would be a good role for him, I know Mark Hammill is very popular with the fans as the animated Joker.",Happy
960,I think he would be popular with fans no matter what he was to do since star wars. Lol.,Neutral
960," I agree! It was nice talking with you, have a great day!",Happy
961,hello.,Happy
961," Hello, do you like attending concerts?",Curious to dive deeper
961,I havent really been to very many. The couple I have been to were cool though.,Happy
961,Did you know that Linkin Park played 324 concerts back in 2001?,Surprised
961,Thats a lot for one year. the ramones toured non stop for 20 years.,Happy
961,I agree. Wow that's a lot of touring over 20 years as well.,Surprised
961,They did 2263 shows in all.,Happy
961," Holy cow! In Croatia, there is an ancient Roman amphitheater that is still used today as a concert venue.",Surprised
961,Thats sounds like it would be neat to check out.,Happy
961,I agree. Creed played a concert that was so bad back in 2002 that four people who attended the concert file a lawsuit against the band.,Surprised
961,Thats nuts. I was never a creed fan though. It would have to be pretty bad to be sued over though.,Happy
961,Me either. Pink Floyd once recorded a live concert at an amphitheater in Pompeii.,Surprised
961,I heard that. There was no audience at that concert either.,Happy
961,Yep. I've actually seen that concert on video. It was really good.,Surprised
961,thats cool. On another note. Did you know that tom hanks is the highest box office grosser,Happy
961," Wow, did not know that. I did see that he has earned over $8.5 billion in film earnings.",Surprised
961,That is sure a lot of moo la.,Happy
961,Agreed. Disney once considered shutting down their animation studio after Sleepy Beauty flopped at the box office.,Surprised
961,That wasnt as big of a flop as treasure planet though.,Happy
961,Yea that was a bad one. Almost seems impossible to believe.,Surprised
961,Iknow right. Well you have a good one.,Happy
962,Are you familiar with DC Comics? One of their artists recently died.,Curious to dive deeper
962,I see that. The artist for Batman.,Curious to dive deeper
962," I don't know much about comics. I know that DC created Batman a while back, and that there have been many incarnations of him.",Curious to dive deeper
962,This is funny.. Marvel comics spent 10 years convincing the us government that x-men are not human.,Surprised
962,Why is that? What does it matter whether they're human or not?,Surprised
962,No idea. Maybe the gov't thought they were a threat?,Curious to dive deeper
962,I think it's funny that Marvel trademarked the names super hero and super villain. What other words could they grab for themselves?,Surprised
962,brainiac from what I'm reading!,Curious to dive deeper
962," I bet Stan Lee would try to grab ""Excelsior!""",Happy
962,i bet he would! Michael jackson tried to buy marvel comics in the early 1990's so that he could play spider-man in his own produced movie,Curious to dive deeper
962," Oy. That would not be so good. Now that Disney owns Marvel, I expect a dozen superhero films a year. Will they try to buy DC next?",Curious to dive deeper
962," Probably not, but, Dc comics paid $130 in 1938 for exclusive rights to superman.",Curious to dive deeper
962,Those rights must be worth a ton now. The name DC Comics is redundant. I never knew that. I appreciate that Michigan State U has the biggest collection of comic in the world.,Curious to dive deeper
962," isn't that fun? Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight.",Curious to dive deeper
962," Comics hold attention, but not because they're funny. In fact, it seems most comic books are rather serious and dramatic. The word ""comic"" is out of date.",Surprised
962,I agree with you. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale.,Curious to dive deeper
962,I laughed when I heard that Ronald Reagan was deemed not presidential enough for a role. I wonder what a president looks like then.,Surprised
962,He showed them! A canadian entertainment company will be excavating in the infamous atari video game landfill for a documentary,Curious to dive deeper
962," Oh, is that the one with all the cartridges they couldn't sell because they produced too many for the established user base?",Neutral
962," Yep! The nfl is recognized as an entertainment business rather than a sport, legally, like the wwe",Curious to dive deeper
962," I didn't know that. I know that wrestling isn't a sport because you can't gamble on the outcome, which is known beforehand.",Neutral
962," huh. The ""e"" in chuck e. cheese stands for entertainment. charles entertainment cheese.",Curious to dive deeper
962," Well, it's been fun chatting.",Happy
962,yes it has!,Curious to dive deeper
962,Have a good day!,Happy
963," Hi, are you a Comic Book Fan?",Neutral
963,I like batman and superman.  I heard that Breyfogle died.  He was only 58.,Curious to dive deeper
963,That is sad. He was one of the great Batman artists of all time.,Neutral
963," I did not know that there was more than one artist related to Batman.  Yes,  Breyfogle was very talented.",Sad
963," I didn't either, I just assumed that one drew them all.  I sometimes get confused with who is DC and who is Marvel anyway.",Neutral
963,Me too.  Breyfogle was recognized the first time when worked on Tim Burton's Batman in 1989.,Neutral
963," Wow, he was also one of the first to draw a Robin character, Tim Drake.",Neutral
963,I did not know that.  We will miss a very good talent.,Curious to dive deeper
963,We really will.  Stan Lee will be missed as well.,Neutral
963,Did Stan Lee die?  He wrote 15 DC comics.,Happy
963,Yea,Sad
963,Which one is your favorite super hero?  I like Batman.,Curious to dive deeper
963,Mine is Deadpool.  I like the comedic aspect of it.,Neutral
963,I have never heard of Deadpool.  Is he a superhero?  I like batman pictures that were created by Breyfogle.,Curious to dive deeper
963," Yes, sort of.  He is kind of like the sarcastic superhero, not quite all the way good, but not bad.",Neutral
963,Do you know who owns DC comics?  Is Tim Burton one of the owners?,Curious to dive deeper
963,I am not sure.  I know Gotham is in New Jersey.,Curious to dive deeper
963,Do you mean Gotham city?  Is it actually a real city?,Curious to dive deeper
963," I dont think so, according th DC canon, the Gotham City is in Jersey.  I dont think it is a real place though.",Neutral
963," Apparently, it took 10 years for Marvel comics to convice the goverment that Xmen are not human.",Curious to dive deeper
963," Wow, that is pretty intense.  ",Surprised
963,It is indeed.,Neutral
963," It has been nice chatting, but I must go.  Have a great day!",Neutral
964,Hi are you a fan of DC comics?,Curious to dive deeper
964," Good Morning....well, a bit. I'm 61 year old now and haven't read a comic book since I was around 12. LOL...is Batman still around?",Curious to dive deeper
964," Yes, but it hasn't been the same since Norm Breyfogle died. He was my favorite batman artist and he died at just 58 years of age.",Sad
964,I've  really never heard of Norm Breyfogle before. Did he do the graphics for Batman a long time?,Curious to dive deeper
964," Yes he did, some of the best graphics. In his death he also brought attention to the fact many in the comic book industry don't have health insurance. Kinda crazy to think about, but I guess it makes sense since they are mostly freelance. Doesn't make it right though.",Surprised
964,I believe that everyone in their life should make sure they have health insurance. I mean he drew for Batman for many years...I'm sure it must've come up in conversation through all those years.,Curious to dive deeper
964,The companies you work for should provide it as part of your benefit package especially a large company even if you are technically free lance. He had to start an online fundraiser to cover his medical bills.,Surprised
964," I'm sure that an executive would've mentioned it to him at least once or twice in his career. Heck, I'm guessing even Bruce Wayne would've mentioned it to someone...the dapper guy he was.",Curious to dive deeper
964,Speaking of Wayne did you know Batman was originally named Bat-Man?,Curious to dive deeper
964," No I didn't, wonder why they changed it to just Batman. I wonder if they started off  with just Rob-In...lol. Jason Todd would've like it.",Curious to dive deeper
964," Batman didn't even start in his own comic, he first appeared in Detective Comics issue number #27, probably didn't expect him to become such a big character and just named him last minute.",Neutral
964," I know, heck, when I first started reading comic books, I even remember Batman just being an additional plotline. Didn't even have his own comic for a little while until they fleshed out his character.",Curious to dive deeper
964," That's surprising to me, given how interesting his backstory is. My favorite batman though is the TV show with Adam West.",Happy
964," LOL....I loved Adam West as Batman. Killed his acting career, but he lived a long time relishing it. Man, that show was awesome...loved all the characters. Great Entertainment.",Curious to dive deeper
964,He didn't need anymore jobs although in recent hears he has gotten a few gigs playing himself. Did you know he has the batman logo on one of his molars? That's dedication.,Happy
964," On one of his molars??? Nope never knew that. I've seen a few Youtube interviews with him, and he never mentioned his molar as Batman. He looked and sounded like a really great guy that Adam West.",Curious to dive deeper
964," Speaking of great guys, I was just recently watching the latest animated batman movie and a voice in it was so familiar. Turns out it's Weird Al! I love Weird Al.",Surprised
964,Really? I love Weird Al...another great man of entertainment. I've got just about all of his tunes as MP3s. His videos were hilarious.,Curious to dive deeper
964," Yes, surprised he didn't make a batman song after working on the movie. Another thing I noticed in the movie is Batman and Joker never referred to each other by name. Turns out they never have in any Batman..",Curious to dive deeper
964," Wow....I never knew that either. I'll have to take a look next time I watch the show or movie. Well, I gotta get moving on. It was great talking to you about Norm Breyfogle, Batman, Entertainment and Comic Books....not to mention Weird Al Yankovic....you have a Great day!",Neutral
964," For sure. It's strange once you notice. Have a good day, Bye!",Happy
964,Kapow!,Neutral
965," Hi, how are you doing this fine evening?",Neutral
965," I'm good ,thanks. How are you?",Curious to dive deeper
965," I'm great. I know little about the character named Bat Man. Do you know him, the Bat Man?",Curious to dive deeper
965," Yeah, sure! Have you heard of the Batman villain Condiment King?",Curious to dive deeper
965," No, but he sounds delicious. What is his trademark power? ",Curious to dive deeper
965,I guess he shot out ketchup. But that was also how he was defeated-he slipped on his own ketchup.,Surprised
965," Generally, I am in favor of entertainment, mostly because of its fun factor. When Caesar visited Britain, around 50 BC, he noted that people bred chickens not for food, but for entertainment. Were the people vegans? And did chickens have more colors than the NES? ",Neutral
965," Haha, that is interesting that the Nintendo used to have only 54 colors. I used to think it was awesome.",Surprised
965," It was awesome, but not as awesome as a British chicken. The NES died an untimely death in 2003 in Japan. It should have lived forever.",Sad
965,It lasted longer than I thought though! I remember playing this game in the 90s. It was a track race and you had to stomp on this pad super fast in order to win. Awesome.,Happy
965,That could be your superpower. You could be a comic book hero.,Neutral
965," Do you read comics? There is a new one ""Batman and the Signal"" which is a three issue miniseries.",Curious to dive deeper
965," Unfortunately, my reading is not so good. I usually enjoy the pictures though. Comics have pictures, and usually more than 54 colors.",Neutral
965," Haha, that is true. Have you heard of Duke Thomas? I guess that is a character they are trying to develop.",Curious to dive deeper
965," I do not know Duke Thomas. Is that his title, Duke? Does he own lands?",Neutral
965,He is called the Signal. I guess he fights during the daytime,Surprised
965,That is an unusual superpower. Is he part of a union or something?,Curious to dive deeper
965,I am not sure! They hope that one day he will join the Justice League.,Surprised
965," They are definitely union. Work restrictions, overtime, mandatory dues. The ""Justice"" League. ",Neutral
965," Haha, right? I guess Duke is a teen superhero so he is still evolving.",Curious to dive deeper
965," Yeah, not too good to have child labor in the Justice League. Comics should be held to a higher standard.",Neutral
965," Ahhh, never thought about that! Have a good one!",Surprised
966," How's it going, do you like DC Comics Batman?",Curious to dive deeper
966,Yeah I love Batman. The dark Knight.,Curious to dive deeper
966," Yea, I wonder how much his first apperance in Detective Comics 27 sells for",Curious to dive deeper
966,I bet that one is worth a lot. Batman was created by bob kane and bill finge in 1939. Amazing it is still popular today.,Happy
966," Yea, Bruce Wayne must of been the first character with the billionaire philanthropist alter ego that is popular today",Neutral
966,I love the villains in batman. Especially the joker.,Happy
966," Yea the Joker is an iconic villain, the condiment king on the other hand isn't",Neutral
966," Well when you get defeated by slipping on your own ketchup, I dont think your gonna be remembered very well. Lol.",Happy
966," That's just awful, I wish Batman could have a better fight against the Condiment King. He can't kill him after all, because of his rule.",Neutral
966,I have seen batman throw some people from places it didnt look like they would live. Im just saying I dont know how in stone that rule is. Lol.,Happy
966," Lol, we can only hope. Did you know Gotham city is located in New Jersey and not NY?",Curious to dive deeper
966,I always thought it was based on New York for some reason. Adam west has a batman symbol on one of his molars.,Neutral
966," That is pretty odd, so is batman and joker never referring each other by name",Neutral
966,I watch a cartoon of batman with my son a few days age. Where he goes back to ancient china. They refer to each other by name in that one.,Happy
966," That sounds like an odd premise, I wonder if that was the Batman cartoon Weird Al Yankovich did a voiceover for",Curious to dive deeper
966,I dont think so. Did you know Stan lee end every phone conversation with excelsior.,Neutral
966," No, that's pretty cool, so is Michigan State University largest publicly available comic book collection",Neutral
966,I would say most collectors dont want just anybody touching their comics. Lol.,Happy
966," No I wouldn't lol. It pretty cool that marvel was able to trademark ""super-hero"" and ""super-villain""",Neutral
966,Dc comics stands for Detectice Comics which is redundant. Its Detetictive comcs comics,Happy
966," Lol, I know. Well it was nice chatting with you.",Neutral
967," Hey how are you, do you know what The Signal is by the way? I've never heard of it.",Curious to dive deeper
967,Hey there! Yeah its a new Bat signal that works during the daylight hours!,Happy
967," Ah I gotcha, I wonder what it looks like? Would you like to live in Gotham City?",Curious to dive deeper
967,That would be so cool to live in Gotham city!,Happy
967," For sure, so much stuff going on though. How worthless would it be to a police officer there, always needing Batman lol.",Curious to dive deeper
967,That's only because the police are not as brave as batman.,Happy
967," For sure, all that crime would get so old lol. Batman is pretty cool, I never knew he was made in 1939.",Curious to dive deeper
967," Yep, along with all of the other comic heroes",Happy
967," True, who is your favorite super hero ever?",Curious to dive deeper
967,It would have to be the Joker!,Happy
967,He's a super hero? Why do you like him so much? Very interesting.,Curious to dive deeper
967," Well, if you l  the villains then they are your super hero,",Happy
967," For sure, I've never thought of that before. One man's villain is another man's super hero right? There's some good villains I'd say.",Curious to dive deeper
967,Exactly! Its  so who is the hero and who is the Villain? Just like the new batman vs Robin,Happy
967," I never saw it, was it a good movie? Like was Bane that bad? Batman can be seen as bad too to some people.",Curious to dive deeper
967," I haven't seen it either, i am sure it will be ok.",Happy
967," True, Marvel had the generic comic book too, just to trademark those names. Did you like DC or Marvel more?",Curious to dive deeper
967,I prefer Marvel because Stan Lee was a master!,Happy
967," RIP Stan Lee, he was so cool. So many cool cameos in all of his movies too. I'd like to see the 18th century comics from Japan, I'm actually going there tomorrow.",Curious to dive deeper
967,Oh that would be so cool to see them. I lived in Sasebo Japan for 3 years!,Happy
967," Oh very cool, I'm going to Tokyo and Kyoto, should be fun! Did you like Sasebo? What did you do there?",Curious to dive deeper
967,That's cool! I worked there when i was in the Navy my ship was stationed there,Happy
967," Oh very cool, when did you get out? I was in the Marine Corps, never went to Japan though!",Curious to dive deeper
967," Well, maybe when you get there you can go to a comic con those are so cool",Happy
967," I bet, that'd be fun. I'm going to take off though, take care and great chat!",Curious to dive deeper
968," Hi, how are you tonight? Do you like the piano?",Neutral
968,Hi! I do actually! I even loved the steam pianos that once existed and were audible for miles. How about you?,Happy
968,I had not heard about the steam pianos! That sounds interesting! I do like pianos.,Neutral
968,Did you ever hear the story of the mute man they found in 2005 wandering around the streets of England who could only communicate by a piano? It was sad but also fascinating!,Sad
968," That is an odd story. I wonder how he ""communicated?"" It sounds like Sideshow Bob on the Simpsons.",Neutral
968,So true! Did you also know that Richard Nixon once wrote a piano concert and actually performed it live on The Tonight Show?,Neutral
968," The guy was bright and talented. I didn't like his politics, but he was capable. I guess he had a musical side as well.",Neutral
968," I agree and suppose he did! On a related note, I think it's also fascinating both Haydn and Mozart owned a piano made from the exact same tree. Would I love to get my hands on either of those pianos!",Happy
968,That's amazing! I guess the tree had some magic in its boughs.,Neutral
968," I'm sure it did. I'd also like to get my hands on one of the first typewriters that was made as it was at first called a literary piano, oddly enough. ",Surprised
968," Hm. I guess we're writing a duet right now, then, huh?",Neutral
968," Ha! No kidding! Since we're on the subject of music, do you like concerts as well? Lou Reed and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs back in 2010 and to me, that was very kind of them!",Happy
968,I wonder if they dogs appreciated it! LOL. I think it's an interesting idea. I haven't been to a concert recently. No time or money.,Neutral
968,I understand completely! I was always a fan of Abba and was surprised to learn Abba actually turned down $1 billion to do a reunion tour for 100 concerts. That is truly unbelievable.,Surprised
968," They have to put it behind them. They don't want that life on the road. The money is good, but I think they're tired.",Neutral
968," Agreed and you are right about that. Did you ever hear the story of the girl who was on her way to a Dave Matthews concert and saw a cyclist stranded? She stopped to help him and surprisingly enough, the cyclist was actually Dave Matthews. Talk about weird! Wonder if he gave her free admission? Ha!",Surprised
968,That sounds like something Dave would do. That is an odd coincidence. Almost fate.,Neutral
968,Exactly. So are you also a movie fan? I couldn't believe John Carter broke box office records over in Russia after it bombed for Disney!,Surprised
968,I guess the Russians were looking for something in the film that US audiences didn't like or see. I haven't seen the film.,Neutral
968," Maybe so. Since we're on the box office subject, did you know Mortal Kombat II was the first ever game that actually surpassed box office sales at Hollywood? ",Neutral
968," Yes, the game was intensely popular. It was so good, as good as the arcade version, IIRC. ",Neutral
968," Indeed it was! Can you also believe the Lord of the Rings trilogy was a massive box office success but despite that, it still managed to make huge losses? That is just sad, honestly! Well it was great chatting with you! Take care, friend!",Sad
969," hi, do you like batman?",Curious to dive deeper
969,Yea I enjoy Batman a lot although I haven't read much of the DC comics he's in,Neutral
969,did you know there is a batman villain called condiment king?,Curious to dive deeper
969," No I never knew that, I wonder if he was a reason why Michael Keaton declined 15,000,000 to be in Batman Forever",Curious to dive deeper
969,Well it could have been. do you know how condiment king was defeated?,Curious to dive deeper
969," No clue, how?",Curious to dive deeper
969,by slipping on his own ketchup,Curious to dive deeper
969," Lol, I wonder if he was created in one of the 15 dc comics Stan Lee wrote for DC",Curious to dive deeper
969," hahah I do not believe so, but maybe. do you know adam west?",Curious to dive deeper
969,Yea he use to be Batman in the tv show back in the 70s along with Burt Ward as Robin and Ceasar Romero as his arch enemy The Joker,Neutral
969,yeah and he has a batman logo on his molar,Curious to dive deeper
969," Lol, I never knew that. I also never knew the Batman animated show was drawn on black paper instead of white",Surprised
969," oh cool, i guess he is the dark knight after all so it makes sense",Curious to dive deeper
969,Do you like any other comics like X-men? Apparently Marvel had to convince the US government X-men aren't human,Curious to dive deeper
969,yeah they did so that they pay lower prices on mutant toys,Curious to dive deeper
969,I never knew that but makes sense. What doesn't make sense is Michael Jackson trying to buy Marvel Comics just so he could play Spider-man,Surprised
969,yeah that is a little over the moon.,Curious to dive deeper
969," Yea, it's also crazy the rights to Superman only cost DC comics $130",Surprised
969,yeah. do you know how Stan Lee ended all his calls?,Curious to dive deeper
969,With a catch phrase I think but not 100% sure,Neutral
969,yeah it is 'excelsior'. nice chat,Happy
970,Do you like Batman?,Curious to dive deeper
970,Yeah. Batman is awesome.,Happy
970,He first appeared in 1939. That is a long time!,Surprised
970," It sure is. I know I liked batman, and both my sons like him. He is pretty popular.",Happy
970,It's interesting that he doesn't have any superpowers.,Happy
970,I know thats the best part. Anybody who wanted to could become batman. Just got to have the will power and drive to go through with it.,Happy
970," Yeah, you're right. That's what makes the character so appealing. Have you heard of the Batman villain condiment king?",Curious to dive deeper
970,Yeah he was defeated by slipping on his own ketchup.,Happy
970," Yeah, that sounds quite messy, haha! And speaking of villains, have you noticed when Batman and Joker are face to face that they don't refer to each other by name?",Curious to dive deeper
970,I didn't noticed that at all. Did you know gotham is supposed to be in NJ.,Happy
970,I was not aware of that. That's really interesting. And the Marvel Cinematic Universe takes place in earth-199999 not earth 616 like the comic book. I am not sure exactly what the difference is.,Surprised
970,Me either. Do you know who adam west is.,Happy
970," I'm not sure exactly, who is he?",Curious to dive deeper
970,He used to play batman back in the 60s I think.,Happy
970," Yeah, I heard he has a Batman logo on one of his molars.",Surprised
970,That is true.,Happy
970,So I guess people thought that Batman was going to get married with Catwoman?,Curious to dive deeper
970,I always thought they were enemies. Catwoman is not a good guy. Lol.,Happy
970," Fans were disappointed because after they had been engaged for months, it didn't happen.",Surprised
970,I didnt catch that version of batman. I know there are a lot of different variations out there.,Happy
970,Yeah it was one of the comic books.,Curious to dive deeper
971," Hi, how are you?",Neutral
971," I'm doing well, yourself?",Neutral
971,I'm great! Are you a fan of music?,Neutral
971,I love music! In fact one of my favorite instruments is the piano.,Happy
971,The universal instrument! Where is the place that you would least expect to find a piano?,Neutral
971," I can think of quite a few places, but one that certainly surprised me was when a group of climbers found a piano at the top of Britain's highest mountain.",Surprised
971,I wonder if that piano ever gets tuned. Probably not a good-sounding piano at this point.,Neutral
971,Ha ha. Did you know that there is a song solely composed to stress test auto-pianos & it is not remotely playable by humans!,Surprised
971,I guess it was composed for machines!  I like that Freddie Mercury used the same piano as Paul McCartney.,Neutral
971," Yes, amazingly they both recorded one of their biggest hits on that piano ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" by Freddie & ""Hey Jude"" by Paul.",Neutral
971,There might be some magic in that piano. What about the aluminum grand piano  built for the lounge of the airship hindenburg? How would that sound?,Curious to dive deeper
971," I to wonder how it would sound, such a lightweight piano weighing in at only 356 pounds.",Neutral
971,Aluminum must sound tinny. Do you listen to Linkin Park?,Curious to dive deeper
971,Yes! Linkin Park was one of my favorite rock bands when I was younger. I loved their collaborative album with Jay Z.,Happy
971,I'm amazed that they played 324 concerts in 2001 alone.,Neutral
971," If you think that's amazing wait until you hear this..the Ramones played a total of 2,263 concerts touring non stop for over 20 years.",Happy
971,Those guys must have been running on nuclear power or something .When did they sleep?,Neutral
971," Ha ha. Unfortunately, not every band has had great success with their concerts. In 2002 a Creed concert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band!",Surprised
971," They probably deserved it. Either they got it right like Linkin Park, or they got it wrong. Well, I enjoyed the chat!",Neutral
971," As did I, here is one last tidbit of information for you. In 1972, Pink Floyd recorded a live concert at the Ancient Roman Amphitheater in Pompeii with no audience!",Happy
971,That's Floyd for ya! Thanks again.,Happy
971,Bye now.,Neutral
972,Pluto has dunes did you know that?,Curious to dive deeper
972,Yes! And gravity 1/16 as strong as Earth's.,Curious to dive deeper
972,There's a famous heart shaped basin on Pluto as well and it has surface ripples which means there's wind on Pluto!,Curious to dive deeper
972," Yes, and the dunes may be made of methane grains. It's a completely different environment, with temperatures as low as -380 F.",Curious to dive deeper
972," But still somewhat Earth like!  Jagged mountains, dunes, a lake basin, wind . . .  Just so darn far from the sun.",Curious to dive deeper
972," Yes. And the wind can get up to 20 mph, which isn't much compared to wind on Earth.",Curious to dive deeper
972,It's because of the weak gravity.  Now on Mars they would have stronger winds.,Curious to dive deeper
972,Yes. And a blue sunset.,Curious to dive deeper
972," Oh, I didn't know that.  There's a Mars colonization project that will be funded by creating a reality TV show!",Curious to dive deeper
972,Yes! I heard about that. So I guess the TV show will be about the colonization?,Curious to dive deeper
972,I would think so.  They will experience higher pitch sound than on Earth so they may have broadcast issues.,Curious to dive deeper
972,Yes. It seems like a lot could potentially go wrong there.,Curious to dive deeper
972,Well they lost a satellite there because of the difference in the metric and the imperial system.,Curious to dive deeper
972," Yes, I heard about that. Did you know there's a dwarf planet that orbits between Mars and Jupiter?",Curious to dive deeper
972," No, I didn't know that I know that Neptune only completed it's 11th full orbit since discovery in 1846.",Curious to dive deeper
972,Really? That's amazing!,Curious to dive deeper
972,It is amazing.  Do you realize Pluto is 4 BILLION miles from the sun?,Curious to dive deeper
972,Wow. It's hard to conceptualize that kind of distance.,Curious to dive deeper
972,Indeed!  Did you know lightening bolts are hotter than the surface of the sun?,Curious to dive deeper
972," Yes, I have heard that! And the direction of Earth's magnetic field reverses every 200,000 - 300,000 years. I wonder when the next reversal will take place.",Curious to dive deeper
972,Nobody knows.  Nice chatting with you.,Curious to dive deeper
973," Hey there, I like reading about astronomy, science and the planets. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
973,Not so much astronomy but I love science in general.  Did you know that Pluto is about 4 billion miles from the sun?,Surprised
973,That's amazing! It's also cool that Pluto also has sand dunes that are windswept. Who knew?,Happy
973,The temperatures there are freezing! minus 380 F,Surprised
973,I am glad the satellites are able to report such good information back to us when they orbit the planets,Curious to dive deeper
973," Like Earth, Pluto has jagged mountains, plains, and changing seasons.",Surprised
973,that blows my mind that other planets in our solar system are so similar to Earth,Surprised
973,It is really neat.  Ryan Ewing a geologist says that the way they're recognizing dunes is the same way we do identify them on Mars,Surprised
973,Wow. I would like to see a picture of the heart shaped basin on Pluto. I will look that up online later.,Happy
973,Exciting stuff!  Walking on duns would be like walking on sand on Earth,Surprised
973,The climate of Pluto may be as fast as 20 mph. Definitely can blow some sand around for sure!,Curious to dive deeper
973,Pluto's dunes rise up to 100 feet high as high as Death Valley National Park,Happy
973," I meant to say the WIND climate! 100 ft high dunes sound frightening, If I am being honest.",Fearful
973,People think that Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago,Curious to dive deeper
973,It was probably longer than that. Who can say for sure?,Neutral
973,I don't think anyone here today can be sure.  But more than 80% of the earth's natural forests have been destroyed already,Surprised
973,Yes. Deforestation is a tragedy. Corporate greed is ruining this beautiful planet.,Disgusted
973,It's sad.  Did you know that the Earth will be pretty much helium free too by the end of the 21st century.,Surprised
973,Talk about adding insult to injury. Poor Earth.......,Disgusted
973,Yes.  With one lightning bolt hotter than the sun's surface that is some power.,Curious to dive deeper
973,The Earth is getting pretty much chewed up. I can stand it!,Fearful
973,Did you know that there is a mars colonization project planned for 2023 which will be funded by creating a reality tv show?,Surprised
973,And the SUN is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star in the galaxy!,Curious to dive deeper
973,That always baffles me.  Lichens and cyanobacteria can thrive on Mars but sounds on Mars may have a higher pitch than on earth because of differences in atmosphere.,Surprised
974,Hello! How are you today?,Curious to dive deeper
974," Great!! and you? Are you into the Solar System? I am watching Nasa live!! got 46 minutes for the rocket to go up!! So exciting, getting dark.",Curious to dive deeper
974,I am! What are you watching it at? Do you know where they are launching from?,Curious to dive deeper
974," I pretty sure its here in Florida on Nasa live on today's date!! They have just cool, relaxing music going while its getting ready!! Oh, on my phone!!",Curious to dive deeper
974,Oh nice! My organization is the one who maintains the launch pad if it's going out of Cape Canaveral! I wonder where it's going?,Surprised
974," Oh, interesting!! I get so excited when they go up. I think its for supplies again! Usually I can run out the door and see it. lol Haven't heard anyone talking yet to find out the details .",Happy
974,I wonder if that mars colonization project in 2023 will happen? Do you know how they will fund it?,Curious to dive deeper
974," lol, yes, I heard it was by a reality TV show! Go figure!! That's going to be something else!!",Surprised
974,I can't wait to watch it. Countdown starts now lol!,Curious to dive deeper
974,Me too! 37 minutes!! Did you know you can fly to mars under 2 or 3 days if you fly under constant 1g accelaration? I think that Mars ride at Epcot lets you know how it would feel!,Surprised
974,I remember taking that ride and was sick from it when it shook you all over the place lol. I think I'll let someone else go to mars haha.,Curious to dive deeper
974," lol, you must of got on the rougher side!! The pressure on your chest in unreal!!",Neutral
974,For sure! Can you believe the sun is only one billionth the size of the biggest star found in our galaxy?,Curious to dive deeper
974," That is beyond what I can visualize!! How do you feel when you hear, If the earth entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period, Humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds!!Omg",Curious to dive deeper
974,I think I can hold my breathe just as long in that comparison. That is nuts!,Curious to dive deeper
974," Ha, ha, ha. Good one!! I think I can too! Do you believe the earth will be helium free by the 21 century?",Curious to dive deeper
974," That is sad, what about balloons and clowns!?!",Curious to dive deeper
974," Yeah, not sure about that one?  It is sad that 80% of the earth's natural forest have been destroy. Takes time to replant and grow!",Sad
974,Now that is even more sad! We definitely need to do something about that. Had a great time chatting with you!,Curious to dive deeper
974,Enjoy your evening and the launch!!,Happy
974,You as well!,Curious to dive deeper
975,I am fascinated by space. How about yourself?,Curious to dive deeper
975,I am!  I am listening to a podcast on it now!  Its called The end of the world as you know it.,Curious to dive deeper
975,That sounds interesting. Did you know that when the Earth was first formed a day only lasted 5.5 hours?,Curious to dive deeper
975,I heard that.  The earth is also 4x as dense as the sun!,Curious to dive deeper
975," Oh wow. I did not know that. To put things into perspective, if we viewed all of Earth's history as one day people would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of it!",Surprised
975," That is pretty incredible, I guess that is talking about modern day humans.  There used to be three types of humans and we are the only to evolve and survive.",Curious to dive deeper
975,I knew we were not the only ones and that we have a long extinct relative but I did not know there were three. Did you know thta we are running out of helium?,Curious to dive deeper
975," I do, but why I dont know, nor what the implications to our lives that will cause.  If it just means no floating balloons, I can deal with that.",Neutral
975,Me too. We will be virtually free of that gas all together by the end of this century.,Neutral
975,It is really scary the amount of damage we have done to the planet in our short time here.,Neutral
975,I agree. We need to do what we can about that. Did you also know that the UN has an oficial ambassador to ET's just in case contact is made?,Curious to dive deeper
975," Really?  That sounds like something you tell someone when you want to impress them, "" Hi, I am the ambassador for aliens.""",Neutral
975," Ha ha, yes it does. It's pretty surprising that that was a priority. Did you also know that the sun is actually white?",Curious to dive deeper
975," Yeah we see it as yellow due to our atmosphere, and Mars sees the sunset as blue.",Neutral
975," Yes, perception is very interesting. Shockingly a lightning bolt is actually hotter than the sun as well. ",Surprised
975," That is hard to believe, but there is a lot of energy in a lightening bolt.",Neutral
975,Yes there is. Did you know that there are much larger stars in our galaxy than the sun?,Curious to dive deeper
975,Yeah.  did you hear about the Mars rover?,Curious to dive deeper
975,I am aware of it but what happened with it?,Curious to dive deeper
975," It died.  Its last words were my battery is low, it is getting dark.",Neutral
975,I know it's just a robot but that makes me super sad. It was nice chatting with you. Have a lovely day.,Sad
976," hey there, do you follow celebrities?",Curious to dive deeper
976," Not very much, do you?",Sad
976," no not really but they are everywhere, especially the kardashians",Sad
976,Yes like at least Justin Beiber can sing.,Disgusted
976," i know. i do not even understand why she is so popular, it is not like she made anything significant. ",Surprised
976," She is a reality tv star, entrepreneur and socialite!",Curious to dive deeper
976,yeah i guess. she was paris hilton's personal assistant once,Surprised
976,Her relationship with Kanye also helped.,Neutral
976,very true. and she was in the music video of fall out boys,Curious to dive deeper
976," I like Fall out boy, do you?",Happy
976," I like them too, good band really. and her father defended oj simpson.",Surprised
976,It is crazy how they all became famous because her dad defended a criminal.,Disgusted
976," i know, that is not fair. onthe other hand she is landing a hand to the armenian genocide, I guess she is half armenian after all",Curious to dive deeper
976,I did not know that. What nationality are you?,Curious to dive deeper
976,i am american.I guess you can find all sorts of info on google nowadays,Curious to dive deeper
976," I am also American and google is used for everything , even has a google translate so I can understand other languages.",Happy
976,yeah it is so convenient. it actually requires more computing to do one google search than to send armstrong and 11 other to the moon,Surprised
976,Fascinating! Do you like going to concerts?,Curious to dive deeper
976," I do, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
976," Yes, I have been to a Lincoln Park concert. Unfortunate what happened.",Sad
976,very much so. was that in 2001 when they held 324 concerts in a year?,Curious to dive deeper
976," No, that was a couple years ago. Wish I saw the Ramones who toured almost non stop for 20 years.",Curious to dive deeper
976,I really wonder how they managed to do that. sounds tiring. nice chatting with you,Happy
977," Hi, how are you?",Neutral
977,Pretty good!  Did you see any super bowl commercials?,Curious to dive deeper
977," No, I didn't get a chance. Which ones did you like? Any recommendations?",Curious to dive deeper
977," The mass mutual one wasn't too bad, focussed on the good things that have happened in this country.",Neutral
977,The Budweiser commercial with Stand By Me. Was that any good?,Neutral
977,Yeah that was pretty good too!,Happy
977,Was there some sort of Kardashian commercial or something? Kim seems a bit of a ditz.,Curious to dive deeper
977,Oh... don't remember that one... and she's a freak if you ask me!,Surprised
977,Used to be Paris Hilton's personal assistant and travel with her. I wonder if that was the only real job she ever had.,Curious to dive deeper
977,Oh really?  I did not know that!,Curious to dive deeper
977," Her dad was part of OJ Simpson's defense team. He seems like a genuine person. The kids, not so much.",Neutral
977,I wonder if she likes linkin park?  They played 324 concerts in 2001 for their debut album.,Curious to dive deeper
977," Those kids must not have slept for year! That's a monster number of concerts! Oh, to be young again!",Neutral
977,Hahaaaa... yeah for sure!  Do you like linkin park?,Curious to dive deeper
977,I don't know them very well. I know that they had the best selling album of the 21st century.,Neutral
977,Oh really?  I did not know that!  What else can you tell me about them?,Curious to dive deeper
977,I heard that the lead singer died. Suicide maybe? A tragedy.,Neutral
977,oh yeah... i forgot all about that!  So sad!,Sad
977," Yes, quite sad. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting with you!",Neutral
977,Did you see that the Ramones toured for almost 20 years straight?,Surprised
977,They are machines. It must be the drugs. They are inhuman. Probably robots.,Neutral
977,have a good one!,Happy
978,You watch the super bowl this year? I love the commercials!,Happy
978,I didn't get to see them! I saw one commercial on TV for Pepsi though. It was fun!,Curious to dive deeper
978,Oh nice. It's tough for companies to choose whether to do a humorous one or a serious one.,Curious to dive deeper
978,Did you see the MassMutual one? I guess it was pretty bad.,Curious to dive deeper
978,I actually don't remember seeing that one. Budweiser had a one minute commercial about the companies recent disaster relief efforts. Smart move for them.,Happy
978," Very smart! A lot of people drink during the super bowl, so good way to get the message out there! ",Surprised
978,Yeah absolutely! I think the Kardashians were in a commercial once. Her dad was famous after defending OJ Simpson.,Surprised
978,Isn't that wild! I was just going to ask if she was in any commercials this year.,Surprised
978,I don't believe so. Despite what everyone says she does some good for the world. Like raiing awareness for the genocide going on in Armenia.,Curious to dive deeper
978,Really? I had no idea! All I ever hear about is her and Kanye's stiff.,Surprised
978,Yeah I agree. She also has a book about her creating the selfie. Lol that sounds like more of what she is known for.,Neutral
978,It really does! I think it's called Selfish too! Did you know she used to be Paris Hiltons personal assistant?,Surprised
978,No that is very funny. I do know that she was in a Fallout Boys music video back in the day.,Surprised
978,I might have to look that up! The only one I have ever seen her in is the one with Kanye!,Surprised
978,Yeah you could probably find it on google for sure! Google is my favorite search tool. They actually mow their lawns at their headquarters with goats!,Surprised
978,Now thats enviormental! I look google too. Did you know they once went down for 5 minutes?,Surprised
978,Yeah man did that cause big problems! It took 40% of web traffic with it!,Surprised
978,That was a big time mess! I read that google also changes it maps when there is a border dispute between countries.,Surprised
978,Interesting. They have a lot of influence around the world. I am very grateful to Larry Page and Sergey Brin for founding the company back in '98.,Happy
978,Me too. Seems like a good company. You ever listen to Linkin Park?,Happy
978,Yeah I have before they are huge. They played 324 concerts in one year surprisingly!,Surprised
979,Do you use Google a lot?,Curious to dive deeper
979,It is the top search engine after all,Neutral
979,So crazy that a single google search takes more computing power than it took to send astronauts to the moon.,Surprised
979,I wonder if that is more because google is so powerful or because technology has advanced so much,Neutral
979,I think technology is advanced. For google to calculate traffic by tracking how fast androids are moving on the roads is pretty amazing.,Surprised
979," In addition, i like how the company goes the extra mile. For instance for disputed borders, they customize google maps according to their respective claims",Neutral
979," Yeah thats cool, probably why when they went down for a 5 minutes in 2013 they took 40% of web traffic with them.",Neutral
979,So what do you usually search on google?,Neutral
979,well I don't search for kim kardashian and her book on selfies. How bout you?,Curious to dive deeper
979,Well i look up odd facts about google and sometimes look up musicians and concerts,Neutral
979,Cool what kind of concerts interest you?,Curious to dive deeper
979," Well as long as its not a creed concert or a heavy metal one, I usually will enjoy them",Neutral
979,Yeah apparently in 2002 four concert goers were so dissatisfied with a Creed concert that they sued the band.,Neutral
979,I heard it was due to the band's horrendous performance,Neutral
979,They were no linkin park.,Neutral
979," It is too bad I never went to the ramones concert, despite them being on tour for over two decades",Neutral
979,That is a long time in 2001 linkin park played 324 concerts from the success of their debut album.,Neutral
979," I mean ya, the ramones played like 2K concerts so about 100 per year so 300 is amazing. Cudos to linkin park",Neutral
979,That is an impressive career to go non stop for so long.,Surprised
979," In any case, I want to thank you for the enjoyable chat. I hope you have a nice day.",Neutral
979," Likewise, have a great day.",Neutral
980,I find space to be fascinating. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
980,I do too! Can you believe the sunset on mars is blue?,Curious to dive deeper
980,I had no idea. I bet that is beautiful. Did you know that sound on Mars may have a higher pitch than on Earth?,Curious to dive deeper
980," I believe it! Mars is so cool, I'm glad we are getting more research done up there!",Surprised
980,I agree. If you were able to fly to Mars under constant 1g acceleration it would only take 2 or 3 days. Maybe we will be able to accomplish that someday.,Curious to dive deeper
980,I'm sure we will! I think it is cool that curiosity robot sings happy birthday to itself on mars!,Surprised
980,Oh wow! That's adorable. Apparently Lichens and Cybanobacteria would be able to live on Mars. Do you think we will find microscopic life on Mars?,Curious to dive deeper
980,I hope we do! Do you know why we call it mars?,Curious to dive deeper
980,I do not. Why do we call it Mars?,Curious to dive deeper
980,It's named after the roman god of war! Interesting huh?,Curious to dive deeper
980,Very interesting. I should have guessed that since so many celestial bodies are named after gods. Did you know that a satellite was lost on Mars?,Curious to dive deeper
980," I didn't hear about that, what happened?",Surprised
980,It was because Locheed Martin used the imperial system but Nasa used metric. Whoops.,Neutral
980,Maybe they should have planned that a little better! I think it's epic that the sun makes up 99.86 percent of the mass of our solar system!,Curious to dive deeper
980,I did not know that either. That's mind boggling.,Surprised
980,I agree! There's even a radio station that translate solar activity into sound for you!,Curious to dive deeper
980,That would be interesting to listen to. Did you know that the sun is actually white?,Curious to dive deeper
980," I didn't know that, I wonder why we see it as yellow!",Curious to dive deeper
980,It is because of atmospheric scattering.,Neutral
980,That is so interesting! Earth and everything is so exciting! Well I had a great chat with you!,Curious to dive deeper
980,Nice chatting with you as well. Have a lovely evening.,Neutral
981,Are you a fan of Game of Thrones? It's won a ton of awards.,Neutral
981," No, not really. Isn't it helping Netflix become the #1 streaming service over HBO?",Curious to dive deeper
981," I think GoT is HBO. The next season will be the last one, so I don't know what HBO is going to do to replace it. Probably there will be prequels and such.",Curious to dive deeper
981,Maybe that is why they are still on top but Netflix will soon overtake them if thats the case.,Neutral
981," Netflix has been great. It accounts for so much internet traffic! People want their TV, it seems.",Surprised
981,Do you have a favorite show on Netflix?,Curious to dive deeper
981,I liked House of Cards. Too bad about Kevin Spacey. I think that the show could have kept going if he hadn't done what he did.,Sad
981,He was just in court for his initial appearance. I wonder if he will  ever have a show on Netflix again?,Curious to dive deeper
981," I doubt it. He'd have to start his own network to get a show. I was surprised that Netflix spends more on postage than on bandwidth. There are over 100 million subscribers, too.",Surprised
981,Netflix didn't approve of his weird home video he posted online on YouTube either. It seemed odd and sad.,Neutral
981," I think he needs to go a very different direction in life at this point. No network can save him. I am surprised that Netflix isn't in China, though I guess the gov't wants to have its own Netflix-style channel to capture all the profits.",Neutral
981,Netflix has nearly 137 million subscribers worldwide. That is a lot in just the short time its been operating,Neutral
981,The stock has gone through the roof! I think that other companies will follow suit. Too much opportunity to distribute shows to a hungry public,Curious to dive deeper
981," Together with You Tube, they take up nearly half of the internet traffic each day",Happy
981,I wonder if the Internet will ever just get overwhelmed with all the traffic of people bored at work watching movies.,Curious to dive deeper
981,I am curious to know what there plans are for the future considering they took on more than $2 Billionn in more debt?,Curious to dive deeper
981,The company is worth more than $2 billion in stock valuation. I don't know how much debt they have. It's ironic that Blockbuster turned down the low price of $50 mill. Oops.,Curious to dive deeper
981,HOrrible business decision there. Now look where Blockbuster is nowadays.,Neutral
981,They are down to two shops in the world. Businesses like to cling to the old model of doing things.,Disgusted

982," Yes, you are right, sorry to know that. I saw her too in Seinfield.",Neutral
982," I'm not too big into the emmy's but I'm surprised to hear Sandra Oh never won one, she's been on tv for a long time",Surprised
982," Well, that happens, do you remember the Old Queer Eye for the Straight Guy?",Neutral
982," Lol yea, is that still on?",Curious to dive deeper
982," They have a new version, looks like, I guess Carson and all of them are old now. Nice to meet you.",Neutral

983," I keep up with the Emmys, Game Of Thrones 22 nominations is really impressive",Neutral
983,Nice. Yeah it is. It's the most decorated show in emmy's history.,Surprised
983," Netflix shows had a lot of nominations too, more than HBO",Neutral
983,Yeah I love Netflix. Game of Thrones gets financed by Ireland to boost tourism.,Surprised
983," That's pretty cool, Ireland is a beautiful country.",Neutral
983,Very lush. There is a nat geo show called game of lions that follows the lives of lions like game of thrones characters.,Surprised
983,Nice. I find it funny HBO may reveal the ending of Game of Thrones before the last book comes out,Neutral
983,Yeah it is so often the other way around. very unique. Charlie Chaplin's grand daughter plays Talisa Maegyr.,Surprised
983," That's interesting, Jack Gleeson is influenced by Joaquin Pheonix when playing Joffrey",Neutral
983,Oh man I hated that character! Arya must have been influential because it's one of the most popular baby names now lol.,Surprised
983," Winning an emmy and golden globe was pretty influential for Pert Dinklage, he received top billing after he won",Neutral
983,Yeah. He packs a punch! One of my favorite characters. There is a lot to that show having 3 different story arcs and all.,Neutral
983,Yea it's pretty complex show. Do you watch netflix much? They have a movie that is nothing but a fireplace,Curious to dive deeper
983,Yes I do. That's funny! Hard to believe it was only in 2007 that they started streaming content. Now look at it go.,Surprised
983,Yea now Netflix has 137 million subscribers worldwide,Neutral
983,Wow. Everyone loves it and for good reason. Blockbuster could have bee involved if they would hae just bought it when they had the chance.,Surprised
983,Blockbuster really screwed up when it declines Netflix proposal to run it's online service in 2000,Neutral
983,Oh interesting I didn't hear about that. Yeah they should have. Because now Netflix is worth 2 billion!,Surprised
983," Yep, Netflix is everywhere except mainland China, Syria, Crimea, and North Korea",Neutral
983,Wow. Taking over! Well have a great day!,Neutral
984,Do you have netflix?,Neutral
984," Yes, I do. I like Netflix, they always have something on that I never saw before.  I just recently found out that Netflix started way back in 1997. That was news to me.",Curious to dive deeper
984,How long have you had netflix?,Neutral
984," I've had Netflix for years now.  Lucky thing that after racking up a $40 late fee on a VHS copy of Apollo 13, Reed Hastings was inspired to start Netflix.",Curious to dive deeper
984,I would be happy to pay 40 in late fees to create a multi billion dollar company,Neutral
984," Me, too.  As of October 2018, Netflix has 137 million total subscribers worldwide, that is outrageously great.",Curious to dive deeper
984,I mean they account for 1/3 of all bandwidth during peak hours,Neutral
984," Yes, Netflix and Youtube together make up half of peak Internet traffic in North America.  That is so true.",Curious to dive deeper
984,I bet blockbuster sure regrets not buying netflix,Neutral
984," They probably do, big time.  Blockbuster declined several offers to buy Netflix for $50 million.  Netflix is now work $2 billion.",Curious to dive deeper
984," I mean still 50 million isn't a small sum, but still totally worth it",Neutral
984," Yes. Netflix expanded its business in 2007 with the introduction of streaming media which is about the time, I started watching it.",Curious to dive deeper
984,Any genre or particular show you watch on it?,Neutral
984,I just started watching Northern Rescue.  That one is pretty good.  Did you know that Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than on bandwidth?  The post office is making some money on them.,Curious to dive deeper
984,I personally enjoy comedy genre like kung fu hustle,Neutral
984," Yes, Bill Murray loved that too.  He thought it was the ""supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy"".",Curious to dive deeper
984,I agree. Alot of today's cliches were first shown by that film,Neutral
984," Did you know that from 9pm to 12am, Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in North America?  Wow.",Curious to dive deeper
984,I'm not surprised considering their dominance,Neutral

985," Hi, how are you? have you had trouble with the servers today? Also: do you like albums?",Neutral
985," I'm doing great. How about you? I do like albums a lot. How about you, do you like albums?",Happy
985,I do like albums. i usually listen to jazz albums on youtube.,Neutral
985,Oh! That is very nice. Do you happen to know when albums were first developed?,Curious to dive deeper
985,I dont know. older records were too quick to store enough music. probably when 33 rpm records came out?,Neutral
985,Do you happen to know year when these came out?,Curious to dive deeper
985,I dont know. i used 45s when I was younger. 33s were there in the 1960s. not sure.,Neutral
985,Oh! Thanks anyways. I was wondering where can an album be recorded?,Curious to dive deeper
985," I guess you could record one in your home, but people go to studios and work with an engineer.",Neutral
985," Oh! Thanks, I didn't know. Could you tell me why are studios are built?",Curious to dive deeper
985,Studios are built because they are sound proof. you can record there without noise interfering with the recording.,Neutral
985," Thank you so much. I'm curious, what is an album exactly?",Curious to dive deeper
985," It is a collection of audio recordings issued as a collection on compact disc (CD), vinyl, audio tape, or another medium. ",Neutral
985," Oh! Thank you so much, this very helpful. Do you happen to know by any chance what was one of the best selling albums of 2014?",Curious to dive deeper
985," 2014? That was a good years for albums, if i recall correctly. probably some vintage albums continued to sell well.",Neutral
985,Wow!!! I didn't know that. Do you happen to know the name of any of those albums?,Curious to dive deeper
985," Pink FLoyd had an album called Dark Side of the Moon, which probably continued to do well in 2014.",Neutral
985,Wow!! That is awesome. Could you tell me when this particular album got released?,Curious to dive deeper
985," I think it was in the early 70s. I dont remember exactly. 71? 72? something like that. anyway, great chat!",Neutral
985,I guess it was a very long time ago. Wow!!! Thanks. Do you know what is the best selling album of the 21 centrury?,Curious to dive deeper
985,Probably something by Linkin Park. I dont remember the name. Have a good weekend!,Neutral
985,I read recently that it was Hybrid Theory. Thanks for chatting with me today. You have a great weekend as well!,Curious to dive deeper
986,I enjoy a lot of music. How about yourself?,Curious to dive deeper
986,I love music. I think there is something about music that just speaks to the soul of a person.,Neutral
986,I agree. Did you know that Linkin Park had the best selling album of the 21st century? That's very surprising to me.,Surprised
986,Oh wow really? That is surprising to me. I would have thought it was something much more classical.,Surprised
986,My guess would have been The Beatles.,Curious to dive deeper
986,Them or the rolling stones. I guess people really love Linkin Park. I know I enjoy their music.,Surprised
986,Yes the Stones would also make sense. Did you know that Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon was still one of the best selling albums in 2014?,Surprised
986,Wow. You would think that by now everyone who wants a copy would have one.,Surprised
986,Apparently new generations are discovering it and still like it. Do you remember NWA?,Curious to dive deeper
986,Yes the straight out of compton album seemed like it was very popular even though you never really heard it on the radio.,Neutral
986,It was. It was actually the first album to reach platinum without the support of airplay.,Curious to dive deeper
986,That is so cool. I wonder why it didn't get much airplay. It seems like the radios really missed out on a chance there.,Neutral
986,I remember the language being very graphic. It probably would have just sounded like a series of beeps ha ha.,Neutral
986,Thats a good point. They could probably get away with playing now though. the radio stations seem like they are bit more relaxed in what they play.,Neutral
986,They are a lot more relaxed than they were then. Do you also remember Reel Big Fish by any chance?,Curious to dive deeper
986,No I don't. Were they popular?,Curious to dive deeper
986,Briefly but not as much as the other bands we have talked about. It was during that whole ska phase. They lost the rights to their old record label so they re-recorded all of their hits for a best of album. I've never heard of a band doing that.,Surprised
986,Huh. I wonder how that didn't infringe on copyright law. I think someone's lawyer dropped the ball there.,Curious to dive deeper
986," I was wondering that as well. On a lighter note, two identical twins in Japan recorded a rap album at 100 years old. That has to be something to hear. ",Happy
986,That would be fun to hear. Sometimes we discount older people but if it was released it had to be pretty good.,Neutral
986,Agreed but rap seems like a very odd choice.,Curious to dive deeper
987," if you want to see barack obama, you can apparently just zoom into the white house picture on google maps",Surprised
987,I think that's kinda cool. He also has an official sign in American Sign Language.,Neutral
987," that is interesting, also I guess obama's codename by the secret service was renegade for some reason",Surprised
987," I guess they pick nicknames that are amusing to them. I'm concerned that Goldman Sachs donated so much to his 2008 campaign. When the crash hit, he already owed them a lot.",Neutral
987," haha well that would explain why none of those people were prosectured after the crash, and apparently even if Obama were born in Kenya he would still be eligible to be president",Surprised
987," yes, as long as you are born to US citizens, you are a US citizen by birth, and that's good enough to be president. McCain was born in Panama. I don't understand the obsession with his birth certificate.",Neutral
987," ya I'm not sure either, do you like music at all?",Curious to dive deeper
987," Yes, I enjoy music. What about you?",Neutral
987," I do, I don't like LInkin Park but apparently their hybrid theory is the best selling album of the 21st century so far",Surprised
987,Those guys did an insane number of concerts in the year following the release of that album. I wonder if they did a clean version of their album for Walmart.,Curious to dive deeper
987," haha good question, I also like Pink Floyd and their album Dark side of the Moon is still a top selling record 40 years later",Surprised
987,I guess every generation creates new fans. I know that Floyd recorded an album in an empty stadium.,Neutral
987," that is wild, did you see the two japanese twins that made a rap album, I bet if they did a concert it would also be to an empty stadium haha",Happy
987,Are those the twins that are 100 years old? I bet they spit mad fire yo. Aerosmith keeps rocking too. They made more money on a video game than on their albums.,Neutral
987," haha that is them, I think it's impressive that NWA released an album that went platinum without any airplay or a tour",Surprised
987,The streets saw the talent and supported them. I don't think NWA could do a clean version for Walmart. Wouldn't be any lyrics left.,Neutral
987,haha just release a blank cd! Do you do fantasy football? apparently they have fantasy spelling bees haha,Surprised
987,I guess people will place a wager on anything. I wonder who majors in Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature in college. Seems like a waste.,Curious to dive deeper
987," that does, and yeah people even do fantasy politics and draft congress members, that just seems silly",Surprised
987," People love risk and gambling. I'm not into politics enough to bet, but I think people that know the candidates can make some dough.",Neutral
987," oh I bet, speaking of fantasy I think its interesting that a fantasy author was knighted because of how great his writing was",Surprised
988,I always enjoy reading about people's idea of a dream day. Sometimes it gives me ideas of things to do.,Happy
988," That is an interesting article, so many things to do at the D.C area",Curious to dive deeper
988," Yeah, most of it didn't sound fun to me but the menu ideas sounded amazing.",Happy
988," I agree, have you been to the D.C area before?   I would like to go to the Natural History Mesuem, that seems like a great place",Curious to dive deeper
988," No, I never have. Never been east of the Mississippi. Have you been to DC?",Neutral
988," I have been to D.C  I think its a great place, what would you like to do there?",Curious to dive deeper
988," Probably just check out all the standard touristy stuff LOL. I'd like to see the Library of Congress, but I'd wind up living on the streets there just to have continuing access to it. What did you do?",Happy
988," That doesnt sound like a fun activity lol, I would like to try one of those sweet caffeinated drinks",Curious to dive deeper
988," Yeah, I'm not sure what she was talking about because I never tried Starbucks tea. Sounded like ordering two drinks and mixing them together. Also the seafood sounded amazing -- especially the calamari. ",Happy
988," Those dishes sound great, I would like to try them out as well, the cuisine in the area must be one of the best in the whole country",Curious to dive deeper
988," Probably. They say DC used to be a backwater compared to New York, but since it expanded so much after WWII it's probably a lot better. ",Curious to dive deeper
988," it must be a lot better by now, so do you like fantasy?",Curious to dive deeper
988," Not really -- I like some of the usual children's fantasy lit that's popular among adult stoners like Lewis Carroll and Kenneth Graham LOL, but mostly sci-fi. How about you?",Happy
988," I do, I like fantasy movies and also games, a janitor from Chicago wrote a 15000 page fantasy manuscript!!",Curious to dive deeper
988,I wonder if it was any good.,Curious to dive deeper
988," I bet a few pages were, too bad it got discovered after his death",Curious to dive deeper
988,I should Google to find out more about it. It would be nice if it got published.,Curious to dive deeper
988," Maybe it is, who knows movies might be inspired in his masterpiece, 15000 pages is a lot, ",Curious to dive deeper
988," Yeah, that's not a ""novel"" -- it's a whole series!",Happy
988," Yeah a whole series I agree, he must had invested a lot of time in it",Curious to dive deeper
988,Must've been his secret life away from work. Nice chatting with you!,Neutral
989,hi how are you? do you go to concerts much?,Neutral
989,I have been to a few concerts in the past but it has been a very long time.,Curious to dive deeper
989,i have not gone recently. i dont have the cash or the time. id like to go. they are fun.,Neutral
989," i went to an Eminem concert when I was much younger, that was a really crazy concert.",Curious to dive deeper
989,i bet he was dope live. he can spit made fire yo. he is the stuff.,Neutral
989," Yeah his concert was one of the craziest I have ever been to, and yeah his stuff is really good when you hear it live.",Curious to dive deeper
989," he wanted to be a comic book artist originally. Some bands are just great live. Due to the success of their debut album, linkin park played 324 concerts in 2001 alone. I bet they got really good at live shows.",Neutral
989," Yep that is why he references comic books in a ton of his older songs, Linkin park was an amazing band, but i am not sure we will hear much from them again.",Curious to dive deeper
989,that was tragic what happened to the singer. i guess they have a best selling album too. the ramones have showed no signs of slowing down.,Neutral
989," Do you watch youtube videos? In 2007, youtube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire internet in the year 2000.",Curious to dive deeper
989,i have watched them. youtube is a monster. everyone uses it. it is the new television.,Neutral
989," Do you think pewdiepie can stay on top, or will Tseries finaly win? Think he can hit 100 million before they do?",Curious to dive deeper
989,i do not follow pdp. he is a strange phenomenon to me. why watch someone playing video games?,Neutral
989," Their reactions and commentary are the biggest reasons, it is why twitch is so popular, also he doesn't really play games that much anymore, his content has swayed away from that.",Curious to dive deeper
989,you sound like a fan. i have not followed him. i think that youtube had spawned stuff that will never make sense to my generation.,Neutral
989," I watch him on and off, i didn't watch him when he just played games, because there are better channels to watch if you want that, like roosterteeth, but since his content changed his stuff is a lot better.",Curious to dive deeper
989,i think that there are things lurking on youtube that will boggle my addled mind. i should stick to old fashioned sitcoms and spielberg movies.,Neutral
989," Well you can't go wrong with jaws or E.T, and some older sitcoms are great, I love golden girls, and the Andy Griffith show.",Curious to dive deeper
989," the old shows always please. I like to go back and watch them again. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
989," yeah same to you, was a pleasure.",Curious to dive deeper
989,Have a good one!,Neutral
989,same to you,Happy
990,Hey there do you like listening to concerts? I really like Pink Floyd myself. I've seen them a couple times,Curious to dive deeper
990," I do, I love concerts Pink Floyd is a great artist, he recorded a live concert once without audience",Curious to dive deeper
990,That is really cool. It was in Pompeii at and Amphitheatre. Back in 1972 And there's no audience that's so weird!,Surprised
990," Yeah why would he make a concert without an audience, I guess he had his reasons, do you know the band  Creed?",Curious to dive deeper
990,I have heard of them. Didn't they get sued because their concerts were so bad LOL,Curious to dive deeper
990," They did lol, it was a terrible concert, that happened back in 2002, the band has great songs I don't know what happened there",Curious to dive deeper
990,Yeah I would like to get to the bottom of that story haha. Do you ever listen to Linkin Park?,Curious to dive deeper
990," I do, too bad the leading singer committed suicide, I loved the band",Sad
990,Yeah that was too bad. One crazy thing that they did was to do 324 concerts in 2001. That is so many and insane,Surprised
990," I agree that like a concert a day, who has the energy for that?",Curious to dive deeper
990,Hahah that'll do it! do you like The Ramones at all? They also play a lot of concerts,Surprised
990," I do like the Ramones, they played like 2200 concerts in a period of 20 years, ",Curious to dive deeper
990,Yep you're right! Have you ever been to a Roman Amphitheatre? Apparently in Croatia there's one that still puts on concerts,Surprised
990," I haven't, I might travel to Croatia and visit that amphitheatre one day, a lot of history in one place plus good music, ",Curious to dive deeper
990,I agree with you! Do you like Steven Spielberg movies?,Curious to dive deeper
990," I do like his movies, he is also a clarinet player, he played the clarinet in the Jaws soundtrack",Curious to dive deeper
990," That is funny! That's a great movie btw, apparently he still makes a lot of money from the Star Wars bet he made with George Lucas back in 1977",Surprised
990," I wonder what they betted on lol, they must be really good friends, I love Schindlers List, its one of my favorite Spielberg movies",Curious to dive deeper
990,I agree! I even like his crappy movies like hook LOL. how often do you watch YouTube?,Curious to dive deeper
990," I watch YouTube every day so really often, Google made a great purchase there",Curious to dive deeper
990,Oh for sure. I can't believe YouTube is the second largest search engine,Surprised
990," It has become big, there's even a service dedicated only to police called Blutube, ",Curious to dive deeper
991,hi how are you? do you go to concerts?,Neutral

991,i never saw that but i heard about it. was that a retrospective on something?,Neutral
991,Yep. Police have their own version of youtube called blutube. I wonder who came up with that name.,Surprised
991," yeah, it does have a strange sound to it. i would wonder if it had adult material or soemthing. i wouldnt think the police.",Neutral
991,The video gangnam style had so many views that youtube had to upgrade to 64 bits!,Surprised
991,i think its funny that that song got so popular. i dont know it at all. it is for a different generation.,Neutral
991," Well, this generation its all about despacito. That video got over 5 billion views! thats over 5/7 the earth although I  am pretty sure that many individuals have watched it many times",Neutral

992,Have you seen the original deadpool?,Curious to dive deeper
992," Yes, but it was a while back.  Some premium dark humor. I hear Deadpool 2 is good but more of the same...",Curious to dive deeper
992,I heard the same thing. I'm deciding whether or not I should see it. Thoughts?,Curious to dive deeper
992,I think I will be I'm not in a big hurry.  I guess Ryan Reynolds is the voice of a mystery villain...,Surprised
992," Hilarious. By the way, did you know Deadpool 2 is the highest grossing r rated film ever? ",Surprised
992,I think that may be the original one and the stat's for non-Cameron or Lucas directed films...,Surprised
992," Hmm, interesting. You might be right. Have you seen Starship troopers? ",Curious to dive deeper
992,I've see the 1st and 2nd one.  Bugs and more bugs... Did you know the Deadpool video game cost more to make than the movie did?  Wow.,Curious to dive deeper
992," No, are you serious? How much did it cost? ",Surprised

992," No, but I saw the movie. It is an awful turd, at least I thought so. ",Curious to dive deeper
992," I haven't seen it.  Funny, people were in a moral panic in the 18th century because people were reading novels.  They would really freak about graphic novels of the 21st century.",Curious to dive deeper
992," Yeah, that is pretty weird isn't it. Do you like to read comic books? ",Curious to dive deeper
992,Not since I was 12.  Some people are really into it. I do like and appreciate Stan Lee.,Curious to dive deeper
992," Yeah, I haven't read them in a long time either, but I did just see that movie Glass. ",Curious to dive deeper
992," Was it good?  I guess ""DC"" stands for ""Detective Comics"" -- I never know that when I was reading them.",Surprised
992,And here I thought it stood for District of Columbia. LOL,Curious to dive deeper
992," The comics wouldn't be good having been produced by the government. I guess Stan Lee ends conversations by saying ""excelsior!"".  Is that a real word?",Surprised
992," Interesting, I'm not sure. I'd actually have to look that up. Well, nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
992," Stan Lee has appeared on The Big Bang Theory and he says that there.  For comics, MSU is a good place. ",Surprised
992," Interesting. I wonder if he wrote the generic comic book. Well, have a nice day. ",Curious to dive deeper
992," I doubt that.  He doesn't seem like he would be interested in that.  OK, see ya. ",Neutral
992,Take it easy!,Happy
993,Have you seen Deadpool 2? I saw the first one but had too many distractions going on to enjoy it. I liked what I saw because it was sort of funny.,Curious to dive deeper
993," I loved Deadpool 2, Lady luck was my favorite in it, and of course the Juggernaut!",Curious to dive deeper
993,I'd really like to read the Deadpool Comic books. I haven't done any good reading in awhile. Have you?,Curious to dive deeper
993," that would be fun, I have read other superhero ones but never his, they would be so interesting. I love reading though",Curious to dive deeper
993,I think the Black Panther is a good comic book. Did you know that in the original Deadpool comics that he's described as Ryan Reynolds crossed with a Shar Pei? This was before the movie!,Curious to dive deeper
993," no way, his name was actually in the comic book? Do you think that is why he was hired?",Curious to dive deeper
993,That would be really cool if he read it himself and found out that way!  Brianna Hildebrand is in Deadpool 2. She's a good actress.,Happy
993," Who does she play in that movie? Deadpool is the highest grossing r rated film of all time that isn't directed by james cameron or george lucas, I wonder how close deadpool 2came",Curious to dive deeper
993,She's that teenager who's got short hair and I think she had a yellow suit. She was also in the Exorcist. I wonder if they'll be making a Deadpool 3? I hope so.,Curious to dive deeper
993," lol I never knew her name, I liked her. I hope they are making it, I would watch that for sure! Do you know who the director was?",Curious to dive deeper
993," No, I'm not sure, do you know? I know it's by 20th Century Fox but that's it. Did you know Ryan Reynold also is the voice of the mystery villain in Deadpool? That's funny!",Curious to dive deeper
993," Who was the mystery villain, I can't remember them from that movie? I think it was something Miller as the director",Curious to dive deeper
993,I think it's the guy who gave Deadpool his mutant powers and he's trying to find him at one point. It's kind of complicated...that's why I,Neutral
993,that makes sense lol. I will have to rewatch it and listen closely lol. Do you read any other comic books?,Curious to dive deeper
993," No, the most reading I do lately is for work or kids books. It's been awhile since I've gone to a bookstore like Barnes and Noble to get some reading material for myself. What about you?",Curious to dive deeper
993," Me too, I have a bunch of comic books, mostly marvel. I heard marvel created a generic comic book with purposes only to trademark super-hero and super-villain ",Curious to dive deeper
993,i guess that's a good idea if it worked out! I learned in school that people questioned morality of reading novels. I wonder what those same people would say about the comic books of today?,Curious to dive deeper
993,That is a good point. I really got into the movie starship troopers when it came out and the book was even better!,Curious to dive deeper
993,I remember that..I think I even saw it in theater. I guess those people panicking about novels in the 18th century would feel pretty silly in today's world!,Neutral
993," ha for sure, books have changed a lot since then! It is making me want to read my book. it was so good chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
993,I think I'll make it a goal to do more reading! ttyl!,Happy
993,have a good night! Read those books!,Curious to dive deeper
994,Did you watch Deadpool 2?,Curious to dive deeper
994,I watched part of it.  It seemed like the first one. Reynolds felt like he was destined for the role since 2004.  He fits...,Curious to dive deeper
994," He sure sold the part, I heard Deadpool described himsilf as Reynold Reynolds before he was picked for the movie, so yeah seems like destiny",Curious to dive deeper
994,He also did the voice of the mystery villain in DeadPool 2.,Surprised
994," Thats funny, another cooll fact is that the videogame was actually more expensive than the movie",Curious to dive deeper
994," Yeah, games are hard to develop.  DP 1 is the highest grossing R-rated film of all time.  I didn't know it was that popular. ",Surprised
994," Its really funny so that makes sense, I like the cab driver so funny, and also how Deadpool is not really a hero",Curious to dive deeper
994," Was DP ever a comic book?  Marvel once published a ""generic comic book"" so they could trademark the names ""super-hero"" and ""super-villain""",Neutral
994," Yeah it was a comic book his the eternal rival of wolferine, and really? they trademark that, sounds like a smart move",Surprised
994," Yeah.  ""DC"" of comic book fame stands for ""Detective Comics"" making their company name redundant...",Neutral
994," Which one do you like better, DC comics or Marvel comics?",Curious to dive deeper
994,I'm not sure.  I suppose it's a tie.  Michigan State U. has the largest public comic book collection in the world.  Take that textbooks!,Surprised
994," Sounds like an interesting library, sad Stan Lee died, he had an interesting way of ending phone conversations",Curious to dive deeper
994," Stan Lee sometimes appears on The Big Bang Theory.  So, are you a reader?",Curious to dive deeper
994," I do like to read yea, do you?",Curious to dive deeper
994," Yes, if reading off the internet counts.  In the 18th century people had a ""moral panic"" because people were reading novels.  They would totally freak now. ",Surprised
994," They would with all the books available out there, Starship Troopers would create panic and revolutions for sure",Curious to dive deeper
994,I can't believe Starship Troopers is recommended for all 5 military branches. I wonder how it was selected?,Curious to dive deeper
994,Maybe the strategies are good Enders game is another recommened book by the millitary,Curious to dive deeper
994,I can kind of see that.  It isn't full of giant bugs.  Do you speed read?  The record is 4700 words per minute.,Surprised
994,I can kind of see that.  It isn't full of giant bugs.  Do you speed read?  The record is 4700 words per minute.,Curious to dive deeper
995," Good evening! I just got in from seeing Deadpool 2, based on the Marvel character Deadpool. Have you seen it yet?",Curious to dive deeper
995,hi how are you? I have not seen DP 2. I saw the first one and liked it.,Neutral
995,Deadpool is the highest grossing R rated film of all time that's not directed by James Cameron or George Lucas. I wonder if Deadpool 2 will come close to that record?,Curious to dive deeper
995,I think the fans of the character will support the series. i know that the humor is irreverent and that it appeals to a non kid audience.,Neutral
995," Definitely. I didn't realize that in a 2004 comic book series Deadpool described himself as ""Ryan Reynolds crossed with a shar-pei""! I can see why Ryan Reynolds thought he was destined for the role of Deadpool on the big screen!",Happy
995,He was perfect for the role. i dont know the original comic but he really does breathe life into the character.,Neutral
995," He sure does! He shines, though there are so many other stars in the film, like Josh Brolin, Zazie Beetz, and T.J. Miller.",Neutral
995," Yes, the casting was excellent, as far as I can tell. I think that is half the battle for a good film. Drop the right people into the role and the audience will accept the story.",Neutral
995," Definitely. I feel like it's hard to go wrong with a comic book movie. Deadpool 2 is the 11th installment in the X-Men film series, and that's just one comic book franchise releasing films right now!",Surprised
995," actually, i usually dont like comic book movies, mostly because there is too much CGI. i think story and character. most of the superhero stuff is about battles and explosions. i guess im getting old. LOL",Neutral
995,There is a lot of visual excitement. Do you prefer a comic book to a movie? I like reading the panels and imagining some of the action myself,Neutral
995,I am not really a comic book person. i prefer movies. I liked Spider-man 2.,Neutral
995," Spider man is a good one! Marvel really has some great characters. Did you know they published a ""generic comic book"" in order to trademark the names ""super-hero"" and ""super-villain""? Pretty sneaky!",Surprised
995,That is funny! the lawyers were behind that one. i guess they will enforce that? I wonder who they would sue.,Neutral
995,The words seem ubiquitous! But maybe they have a bunch of lawsuits in a different multiverse! I just found out that the Marvel Cinematic universe actually takes place in a different multiverse than the original comic book universe. Now I see why not everything lines up!,Surprised
995," Yes, it is easier to explain everything. i dont really follow comic books, but I guess it gets pretty complicated. ",Neutral
995,What do you like to read? I like to read novels.,Curious to dive deeper
995," I read non fiction usually. i do like stories, but usually watch movies for that. novels are good, a better escape than TV, i think",Neutral
995," I agree. It's hard to believe that in the 18th century there was a ""moral panic"" because of the spread of reading novels! I should probably go catch up on my reading now! ",Happy
995," Yes, please do catch up on your reading! Have a good weekend!",Neutral
995,Good night!,Neutral
995,Good night!,Neutral
995,Bye,Neutral
996,hey do you like comic books? I guess Stan Lee who created a lot of comic book characters always uses the word Excelsior!,Surprised
996,Sure. Did you know that Marvel published a generic comic book in order to trademark the names super-hero and super-villain,Surprised
996," oh wow no I didn't, did you know that DC stands for detective comics? I never knew that",Surprised
996,they say that its company name is redudant due to that.,Neutral
996," ha-ha that makes sense, I live in Michigan and actually MSU has the largest public comic book collection",Curious to dive deeper
996,good to know. It is impressive to know that the first modern comic book was released in the US in 1933. They have been for decades.,Happy
996," wow that is wild, do you watch movies? The movie deadpool is based on a comic and I guess the videogame of Deadpool somehow cost more than the movie they made",Surprised
996," I don't understand how, but indeed cost more. Ryan Reynolds stars as Deadpool in Twentieth Century Fox?",Neutral
996," ah ya I did, did you see deadpool 2? I didn't like it as much as the first",Curious to dive deeper
996,It was good. what do you think about reading 4700 words per minute record?,Surprised
996," I disagree, I 'm not sure if it's possible to retain that much information, do you read a lot?",Curious to dive deeper
996," Yes, I do. Did you know that on the 18th century there was a moral panic due to the spread of reading of novels?",Surprised
996," haha I didn't know that, have you seen the movie starship troopers? apparently that book is recommended reading for the us military",Curious to dive deeper
996," No, I haven't, but they also say that is the first sci-fi novel on the reading list.",Neutral
996," ya, and the thing is the movie is very anti war and anti military, so that is why it is so crazy they would recommend it!",Curious to dive deeper
996,Enders game was also suggested for many military organizations.,Neutral
996," ya have you seen that movie? It's also not very pro military and I didn't like it even though I like Harrison Ford, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
996," no, it is not my type of movie.",Neutral
996,do you like lord of the rings? I like how he would read bad poetry with his friend and do laughing contests at reading it haha,Curious to dive deeper
996," Yes, I do. reading requires creativity and critical analysis.",Neutral
996," yes that's true, I also Like how Deadpool is one of the highest grossing R rated movies ever made, I really like the first one a lot",Curious to dive deeper
997,Have you read any romance novels before?,Curious to dive deeper
997,No I have not.  Do people really read those?,Curious to dive deeper
997," I don't either but I don't get why people label them as bad, stupid, or for losers, would you characterize romance novels as those?",Curious to dive deeper
997," No I would not.  I always say ""to each their own""",Neutral
997,Is there a specific genre you would enjoy the most?,Curious to dive deeper
997,I would have to say Fiction.  I can not believe a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic in the 1950s!,Disgusted
997," That's crazy, why was that even a consideration in the first place, and then they suggested Ender's Game, a science fiction, as reading for military organizations, a little odd.",Surprised
997,It was suggested by the judge because the comic featured a black character.  Awful!,Disgusted
997," Oh wow! That's why, I thought because the judge had an issue with science fiction. I wonder if that were to happen in today's society, what would happen?",Curious to dive deeper
997,Have you ever heard of the science fiction author Isaac Asimov?,Curious to dive deeper
997," No I haven't, is there any notable books that he wrote or perhaps that was later adapted to a movie?",Curious to dive deeper
997," Yes, I, Robot i believe is the name.",Neutral
997," Oh, I think I've seen that. That film was an adaptation of a book? Good thing we live in the current century because in the 18th century, there was even a ""moral panic"" because reading was so widespread! I think we have gone backwards a bit and a lot of people don't read books these days haha.",Surprised
997," Ya I agree.  Reading is great. Apparently the longest piece of fiction is 4 million words long, and it is about a video game called Super Smash Bros.",Surprised
997," Huh, I wonder if that's still considered reading. Maybe if more people read, they would know how to get out of the predicament like when a judge sued a small dry cleaning business for $67 million for losing a pair of pants, I do not know any pants worth that amount of money.",Surprised
997," Speaking of pants.  It was illegal for women to wear pants in Paris, France until 2013.  Can you believe that?",Surprised
997," Does that mean women were only allowed to wear skirts or something? That's insane, I would think that Paris is where fashion originates and people would be more liberal in their fashion adventures!",Surprised
997,Ya apparently.  Women also weren't allowed to wear pants in the US Senate floor until 1993.  I find that so odd.,Surprised
997," That's actually fairly recent I think, I wonder what the definition of  ""saggy pants"" is? If I were to take a stab at it, I'd say anything that displays your undergarments when walking, how would you define it?",Curious to dive deeper
997,I suppose pants below the waistline.,Neutral
997," I think something MC Hammer wore would be considered baggy, it's also the premise for Aladdin's pants too!",Surprised
998,Do you read Romance novels?,Neutral
998,i dont. i do like to read. do you like romance novels?,Neutral
998,No I think they are really boring. I like murder mysteries. The Brits write the best ones. Like Agatha Christie. I like to see if I can figure them out before the end.,Curious to dive deeper
998," yes, it really is a cognitive challenge. people like to form theories and test them as they read. i usually read non fiction though. ",Neutral
998,I will read a textbook if the subject is biology or a science. I haven't read too many since college. I also have favorites like The Lord of the Rings.,Curious to dive deeper
998," Yeah, that was a great series. i read that when i was young. it was like literature, but the story was not dry. the level of language was great!",Neutral
998," Tolkein was an English Professor, I think. The English have more colorful words to describe things than Americans.",Happy
998," he loved language, including dead ones. he was a prof at Oxford i believe. they do love language more in the UK",Neutral
998," Yes, you are right. Reading an American murder mystery is never as interesting as a British one. I do like Nevada Barr, though. She is an American Park Ranger and writes some very interesting mysteries.",Happy
998,I have not heard of her. She is a park ranger? that must make for some interesting stories.,Neutral
998,So far she has written about almost all of the national parks and from a Ranger's point of view.,Curious to dive deeper
998,That is a good story. nothing typical or cliched about that. has she won any awards?,Neutral
998,I am not sure. I think she has. I usually read by author and I should know. I will have to look that up.,Curious to dive deeper
998," Do you read SF? The term ""robotics"" was accidentally coined by science fiction author isaac asimov in 1941.",Neutral
998,I enjoy Asimov but that is not typically my genre. Some of the science fiction portrayed on the old Star Trek series is coming true. Look at their communicators for instance.,Neutral
998," yeah, the imagination leads to the creation of the technology. sci fi is fun that way. imagine it, and then the engineers will come up with it! LOL",Neutral
998,Poe came up with the term cyborg in one of his stories. I think he was a really creepy man but I would have loved to have met him. I like his poem 'The Bells' the best.,Neutral
998,He only got a few bucks for the Raven. i wonder how much money he got in general for his writing.,Neutral
998," Whatever he made I think was spent on alcohol and drugs. What a shame. Then again, maybe he would not have been a good writer if he had been a normal person. Also, I love that poem too.",Curious to dive deeper
998," True, it is a curse to be creative. it is hard to get into the creative mood. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
998," Yes, thank you and have a great day!",Neutral
998,Thanks! You too!,Neutral
998,Bye-I hope this submits.,Neutral
998," Yeah, i hope so too! ",Neutral
998,still here,Neutral
998,Ok bye bye!,Neutral
998,will try,Neutral
999," Hello, have you ever worked in a book store? ",Curious to dive deeper
999," Actually, I did for a brief period. We didn't have many romance novels though.",Curious to dive deeper
999,Really? That is interesting. I'm not into romance novels myself. In fact I don't think I have read any of the ones that they are talking about.,Neutral
999," Same here. It's mainly women who purchase romance novels, with 80 percent of copies being purchased by females.",Neutral
999," I'm actually surprised the number is only 80%. I do like the movie Starship Troopers, I think it is a pretty good sci-fi flick. ",Curious to dive deeper
999,Is Starship Troopers based on a book?,Curious to dive deeper
999," Yeah, it is. It is based on a book, but was made into a movie. They have 3 sequels to it as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
999,Did you see that a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic in the 1950s?,Disgusted
999," I didn't realize that, what was his reasoning? ",Curious to dive deeper
999," The comic featured a black character, which was his only reasoning. ",Curious to dive deeper
999," Wow that is crazy, seems like a mean judge to me. ",Curious to dive deeper
999," Seems so, but the history of science fiction is very interesting. ",Curious to dive deeper
999," I tend to agree. I didn't know Aladdin's pants were modeled after MC Hammer, you can't touch that!",Neutral
999,I think it's crazy that women couldn't wear pants in Paris until 2013.,Curious to dive deeper
999,I was unaware of that. Is this true?,Neutral
999,Seems so. Probably a pretty unofficial ban in modern times.,Curious to dive deeper
999," Yeah, I don't think it is true. I know a lot of french people. ",Neutral
999," I'm sure they probably knew nothing of the ""ban"" since it seems quite ridiculous. ",Surprised
999," Yeah, perhaps it is one of those old laws that is still on the books. WE have some weird laws in the U.S. ",Neutral
999,I agree. Any examples?,Surprised
999," Yeah, in Arizona there is a specific law against feeding garbage to Pigs. ",Neutral
1000," Good morning, are you a big reader?",Curious to dive deeper
1000,I am!  I love reading!,Happy
1000,Who are some of your favorite authors?,Curious to dive deeper
1000,I actually like to read a lot of biographies so it changes from book to book. lol   President Andrew Johnson never attended school in his life and his wife helped him to learn math and how to read.,Happy
1000,I like to read non-fiction and fiction. My favorite genre at the moment is Historical Fiction.,Happy
1000,Nice!  I guess I do like those. I like historical fiction Westerns.  An elementary school replaced desks with reading bicycles and test scores skyrocketed.  That's what I need here at my house!,Happy
1000,It would be a good way to get some exercise during work. I wouldn't want to get too sweaty during the day though.,Surprised
1000," lol true!  Louis Braille, the inventor of the braille system, perfected it when he was just 15.  That's incredible!",Happy
1000," That's pretty amazing, I think I perfect sleeping late and playing video games at 15!",Surprised
1000,LOL nice!  Silent reading is a recent phenomenon.  Only the most skilled readers of the middle ages could read silently.  Interesting.,Happy
1000," I'm not familiar with silent reading, what is that?",Curious to dive deeper
1000,That's where you don't speak while you read.  lol,Happy
1000," Haha, I realized that after I read what I sent a little more closely. I couldn't imagine if everyone was reading out loud all the time.",Surprised
1000,That kind of would have been funny to see. lol  In the 1950's a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it featured a black character.  What a sad sign of the times from back then.,Happy
1000,I would hope there would be more to the story than that just being the reason but it does reflect poorly on that era.,Sad
1000,Yes.  The world's longest piece of fiction is a 4 million word Super Smash Brothers brawl fan fiction!,Happy
1000," Some of those fan fiction writers are really creative, I can't imagine trying to keep up with that.",Surprised
1000,I couldn't that's for sure.  The term robotics was accidentally coined by science fiction author Isaac Asimov in 1941!,Happy
1000," I know he is famous for the 3 laws of robotics and a lot of novels, I don't think I have read any of them though.",Curious to dive deeper
1000,I know I haven't read them.  A drabble is a work of fiction that is exactly 100 words long!  That's neat!  I've had fun chatting with you.,Happy
1000,It was fun chatting with you as well!,Happy
1001,did you know that the seahorse is the only fish that is known to also have a neck?,Surprised
1001," Yes I did, but only because I came upon that fact randomly in my reading. Interesting in it's a way.",Neutral
1001," ya, I wonder what qualifies as a neck? becuase other fish have a separation from their mouth to their body, I don't know, i do want them to mix jellyfish genes with me though so I can become immortal like a jellyfish haha",Curious to dive deeper
1001," Yes, I read about that jellyfish also in my reading, where a skunk emits bad odor or a possum plays dead when under stress or danger in a situation, those jellyfish can revert to smaller, underdeveloped child like states to avoid danger and then grow again in an infinite cycle. Interesting.",Happy
1001," wow that is interesting, theres a lot of weird facts about fish like that, kind of like how 84% of human genes that predict diseases have counterparts in zebrafish, that's just crazy",Curious to dive deeper
1001," Yes, I wonder if those zebrafish used in medical research? I also read the surface of the moon is more known about than the deeps of the sea, who knows what other amazing creatures are down there.",Happy
1001," yes that is wild, I wonder if there is like, a really old dinosaur fish or something else awesome that hasn't been disocvered yet, we know so little about our own planet still and it's sad that 80% of earths natural forest has been eliminated at this point",Surprised
1001," Yes, you compound the loss of forest and photosynthesis, increased amount of CO2 from fossil fuels and global warming it seems a sad future for mankind. Interesting too that all Helium will be gone by the end of this Century.",Fearful
1001," ya that is scary, I know that it's used for balloons but also very important for manufacturing, I hope we can turn our using of resources around, apparently the earth was formed when a day was only 5.5 hours, so I guess the earth would do a complete rotation in that amount of time?",Surprised
1001," Yes, that really amazed me, the Earthy was spinning 5 times faster than it is now? I wonder. A 5.5 hour day would really mess with your sleep cycles. I've been up in northern Sweden when it was only 4 hours of daylight and that messes with you.",Curious to dive deeper
1001," ya that's what I was wondering, like if days are faster but the earth is the same distance from the sun and moving at the same rate, years would be the same length but just have 5 fimes more days in a year",Surprised
1001," I assume if the earth's rotation is slowing at some distant time in the far future the days will be another 5 times longer or like 100 hours in a day. You'd have 50 hours of sunlight and 50 hours of daylight, like 2-3 days. That be a change.",Curious to dive deeper
1001," yes that would be a major change, do you watch hockey at all? typically hockey rings are interchangable with basketball courts in size so they just switch between them at stadiums",Curious to dive deeper
1001," I grew up in St. Louis so in the 80's I went to a lot of Blues-Blackhawks games. I live near Boston so there's a lot of Bruins hockey in the background but I don't have much interest. I knew the ice was below the basketball court and was always amazed there's no condensation, they must have a lot of insulation between.",Neutral
1001," ah I see, what's also crazy is that a hockey player can lose 8 pounds just during one game, that's a lot of weight but I bet it takes lots of energy to play a game, you're always moving, plus being cold will burn calories",Surprised
1001," Yes, and bundled up in all the layers of clothes and pads and protection and helmet while sprinting up and down the ice for 60 minutes. I wasn't really surprised by that fact when I gave it much thoughts.",Surprised
1001," that's true, what is surprising is that in 1993 a hockey player was traded for $1, and later went on to win 4 Stanley Cups, imagine the regret of the first time haha",Surprised
1001," Yes, I'm assuming he made more a $1 after the trade was completed (and was a value at the price). But as I said being a pseudo St. Louis Blues fan they've never won a Stanley Cup so good for that guy.",Happy
1001," ya he must be relaxed, it's weird that Canada's national sports are hockey and lacrosse, I would imagine hockey is but I wouldn't have predicted that lacrosse is their other sport, I'd say that is not too popular in the USA",Curious to dive deeper
1001," I agree, I thought in the US lacrosse was more a rich family/Ivy League elite sport. Canada always struck me more middle/working class so it was surprising to me lacrosse was a national sport.",Happy
1001," yes I agree, my friend played lacrosse in high school but I had never heard of it before he started playing, I've seen it on TV randomly but I always change the channel haha",Surprised
1001," Change the channel, that we agree on regarding lacrosse!",Happy
1001,haha that is true! such a boring thing to watch! give me hockey or football instead,Happy
1002,Do you follow the NHL?,Curious to dive deeper
1002,I loosely follow the NHL,Neutral
1002,I don't really follow it. Apparently the Vegas Golden Knights did well last season.,Curious to dive deeper
1002," Yes, they made the finals. ",Surprised
1002," They got a ton of support from their fans. There were 18,042 fans on average at their home games",Surprised
1002," That's crazy, I've seen that's over capacity of their arena",Surprised
1002," Yes, I am not sure where the extra fans were put.",Curious to dive deeper
1002,They must've included employees in the count.,Curious to dive deeper
1002," Yes, another theory, though may have been a joke, was that pregnant women were included. I can imagine that children who are small enough to fit on the lap without a ticket could also be counted.",Curious to dive deeper
1002,I've known of arenas that used to sell standing room only tickets.,Neutral
1002," Perhaps that was part of the count then. Also, three quarters of Golden Knights fans are locals.",Happy
1002,This is surprising given all that there is to do in Las Vegas.,Surprised
1002,Did you know that Canada has another national sport besides hockey?,Surprised
1002,I was unaware there were any sports in Canada besides hockey!,Curious to dive deeper
1002," Haha, that is funny. Lacrosse is also a national sport in Canada.",Happy
1002," That's interesting, I would've never guessed that.",Surprised
1002,Apparently hockey is a good sport to take up for weight loss. A hockey player can lose up to 8 pounds in a game.,Surprised
1002," I can see that, even with short shifts they come off gassed.",Happy
1002," It's surprising that throughout most of the world, hockey refers to field hockey.",Surprised
1002," I can see it, since its hard to keep ice in warmer climates",Happy
1002,That must be it.,Happy
1003," Good morning, do you like shirts?",Curious to dive deeper
1003," A shirt is just functionary for me, I don't really have an opinion about them.",Neutral
1003," I agree. In China, they have a fashion that involves layering as many shirts as possible and popping the collars.",Surprised
1003," Those Asians country's have some funny habits, but they probably say the same about us.  Kombucha is another one I don't understand.",Curious to dive deeper
1003,Did you know Polo shirts were invented for tennis players?,Surprised
1003," I guess they polo players saw it and thought, we'll have that and put our name on it before the tennis players know what's going on.",Surprised
1003,Did you know button down is where the collar tips fasten to the body of the shirt?,Surprised
1003,I was not aware of that.  I've always been aware of that term but never really put much thought into it.,Neutral
1003,The official business and office attire in Hawaii is an aloha shirt.,Surprised
1003," I never liked dressing up for work back when I was in an office, not sure how I feel about those aloha shirts though, it feels a little like forced merriment.",Sad
1003,Me either. I hate getting dressed up. I saw at Billy May's funeral the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khaki pants.,Surprised
1003,I think that would be more meaningful to me if I knew who Billy Mays was. Was he in the khaki industry?,Curious to dive deeper
1003,He was a face for as seen on TV types of things. He loved blue shirts and khakis.,Neutral
1003," Oh, well I do know who he is, I just didn't know his name.  Did he ever try selling fermented drinks on TV, such as Kombucha?",Curious to dive deeper
1003,Haha no idea. Do you like horror films?,Curious to dive deeper
1003," It depends on my mood.  I can get really worked up at times watching them, I understand I may be burning a number of calories at the time.",Fearful
1003,Me too. Stephen King was terrified of Bambi when he was little.,Surprised
1003," I found that very sad, but not scary.  There's a scary movie called Sunshine that I like, kind of Sci-Fi horror.",Fearful
1003,I've never seen or heard of that one. I saw watching horror movies can actually make you enjoy art more.,Surprised
1003," Must awaken your sense or something.  My son watched a horror movie with me last weekend, as a kid I thought is was scary, he thought it was funny.  I guess tastes change.",Surprised
1003,Haha yep things change. Good talking to you today. Take care.,Happy
1004," Hey, anyone out there? Anyone under the sun?",Curious to dive deeper
1004,we all are since its 109 times earth size,Curious to dive deeper
1004," Yes, it's huge in comparison.  One second of its energy would power us 500,000 years. So long fossil fuel...",Curious to dive deeper
1004,except it takes those same fuels to make renew able fuel sorces like solar panels. sucks,Happy
1004," Always a catch... Speaking of hot things, do you iron your own clothes?",Curious to dive deeper
1004," no anad reading about shirts im glad i dont, ",Curious to dive deeper
1004," Yeah, iron tragedies... Oh no, not the Oxford cloth! ",Neutral
1004," blue shirts and khaki pants, i wonder if they were all properly pressed before hand",Happy
1004,One can only hope... I avoid 100% like I avoid bad alcohol like grappa and kombucha,Curious to dive deeper
1004," lol, id avoid that weird living biohazrd too. ",Disgusted
1004,Yep... BTW: I meant 100% cotton... Hard to do with polo shirts that actually have a tennis history and not polo...,Curious to dive deeper
1004,side stepping here to how odd is it they mention King they mention the shining but not how much the man hated the movie of his book.,Neutral
1004," Hmmm. Weird.  Weird is fitting for King novels.  I read a short story by him, Apt Pupil, and it keeps me out to this very day. ",Curious to dive deeper
1004," i read that in high school right after the movie was released, i was freaked out too. ",Curious to dive deeper
1004," Keeps – creeps… Yeah, I can handle Cujo but that was too real... I think I burned more that 180 calories...",Curious to dive deeper
1004," right, same here, im great with everything else of his but the reality of how quickly people fall into those situations still",Surprised
1004," Not big on the horror genre in general...  Like the Shining, I'll never drink Red Rum...",Curious to dive deeper
1004," lol, i wonder how they got the number of cal. burnt. is it just the average the body uses naturally or is it from the jump scares i wonder",Curious to dive deeper
1004,Maybe some kind of FitBit... Do you think it's possible to do a waterphone solo?,Curious to dive deeper
1004," yes completly in fact, there are several people out there who make music with only found sounds already i bet they already did something ",Curious to dive deeper
1004," That amazing... Puts a new spin on the ""alternative"" genre... Nice talking to you.",Neutral
1005," lets talk about hockey, Canada had a great winter Olympic season in 1924 scoring 132 goals total ",Surprised
1005,Are we talking the ice form or the field form?,Curious to dive deeper
1005," ice form, Lacrosse and ice hockey are both Canada's national sports ",Surprised
1005," Two national sports.  That seems a little greedy.  I've never been much of a skater, a few times when I was a kid, but never got into it.",Neutral
1005,They are the only country in the world that has two national sports,Surprised
1005," Lookin at it on TV I'd imagine those guys must sweat a lot in all that clothing, even if it is on ice.",Curious to dive deeper
1005,There was a hockey player that was traded for a $1 in 1993,Surprised
1005," I could have bought him.  Not sure what I'd do with  hockey player around the house, maybe laundry.  ",Happy
1005," maybe, 8 pounds is the amount an average professional hockey player losses each game. ",Surprised
1005," That's  a lot, you could make a lot of money by marketing a diet plan that loses 8 pounds in a single night.  You could have a nice big dinner after and not feel guilty, a fish supper maybe?",Surprised
1005," yeah, when they switch to basketball the hockey ring stays under the basketball court ",Surprised
1005," I wonder if you can feel the temperature of the ice through the temporary court?  It's time we came up with a new sport, ice basketball, the same basketball just on ice.  Then they would not have to keep switching the court from one to the other.",Happy
1005," Lets talk about the Earth next, it is the third planet from the sun and formed 4.5 billion years ago ",Surprised
1005," I guess the rotation of the earth has slowed, a day used to be 5,5 hours,  a work day would have been shorter then.",Surprised
1005," yes, the earth has already lost so much of its natural forests, around 80 percent of them ",Surprised
1005," From what I hear on the radio it's still losing more, and quickly.  I was also aware that we are losing helium, need to think more carefully about those birthday balloons.",Surprised
1005," I did not know that either, The earth by the end of the 21st century will be virtually helium-free",Surprised
1005," I've heard it a while back, I guess you can't make helium, and when it's released into the air it escapes our atmosphere, never to be seem again.",Sad
1005," If you put the earth's history in a 24 hour period, humans only represent 1 minute 17 seconds ",Surprised
1005," I can never comprehend these time scales, lie the size of galaxies, and distances in light years.  Just too vast to process.",Curious to dive deeper
1005," yeah, the Earth's surface is mostly water, being covered by 71%",Surprised
1006,Hi! Do you like the horror genre? It is meant to elicit fear!,Curious to dive deeper
1006," I love horror films, they are my favorites what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1006," Awesome me too. I love that they were inspired by the works of Poe, Stoker, and Shelley.",Happy
1006," I didn't know that, cool, do you like Christopher Nolan, the director of Inception?",Curious to dive deeper
1006,Yes I love that movie. I don't think it was really a horror movie though. Watching horror movies can burn up to 180 calories!,Surprised
1006," I thought it was kind of scary but yeah, its more like a thriller/suspence movie and 180 calories no kidding?",Surprised
1006,Yeah very surprising right? Those creepy metallic noises in sci-fi or horror films are made by an instrument called the waterphone.,Curious to dive deeper
1006," Oh so thats the name of thats instrument, interesting, another cool fact about horror movies is that E.T was originally meant as a horror movie",Curious to dive deeper
1006,Actually I was kind of scared of that movie as a child. The actor who played the boy in the shining didn't even realize he is acting out horror film until several years later.,Surprised
1006,He didnt? how can he not know the Shinning was a really scary movie? I got really afraid watching it.,Curious to dive deeper
1006,Haha I was scared too but didn't quite wet myself. Almost though lol. They must have shielded him from the actual blood and gore I guess.,Happy
1006," I guess they had a great strategy so do you follow fashion I love wearing T-shirts, they are so comfortable",Curious to dive deeper
1006,Yes I like being fashionable too. Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis players!,Surprised
1006," They were? thats an amazing fact. polo took all the credit for that one, do you know why t-shirts got invented?",Curious to dive deeper
1006,No I'm not sure other than the fact they were invented for tennis players. Official business and office attire in Hawaii is the aloha shirt. Must be much more comfortable than a suit and tie.,Surprised
1006,It is? I love aloha shirts and the t-shirt was actually invented for bachelors who could sew or replace buttons.,Curious to dive deeper
1006," Oh that is really cool. Good to know. In British English, the shirt is more specifically a garment with a collar, sleeves with cuffs, and a full vertical opening with buttons or snaps.",Surprised
1006," Fashion has evolved a lot over the years, good thing fashion has changed its a lot more comfortable now",Curious to dive deeper
1006,Yes it is more comfortable than ever. In China during the cultural Revolution gang fashion involved layering as many clothes as possible and popping the collars. It was nice chatting with you today.,Neutral
1006,That doesnt sound comfortable at all lol a lot of heat by wearing all of them at once. it was great chatting with you as well bye,Curious to dive deeper
1006,Yes,Neutral
1007," Hello, did you enjoy the iron man films. My son loves them.",Happy
1007,I loved all of them!,Happy
1007,Robert Downey jr made 10 million dollars for iron man 2. He only made 500k for the first installment.,Happy
1007,Nice!  The fist movie grossed over $585 million dollars!,Happy
1007,Robert only got 10 million of that. He was the best part of the movie.,Happy
1007," Yes.  The actor who played Ralphie in ""A Christmas Story"" was the executive producer of Iron Man.  I didn't know that.",Surprised
1007,I heard that. Also that he decided to do the movie without a script.,Happy
1007,That's neat!  Paul Bettany the voice of Jarvis has never seen the Iron Man movies.,Happy
1007," Well he must be make a conscience effort not to, because Im sure he has had many chances. Lol.",Happy
1007,lol Right?  Stan Lee created Iron Man because he thought no one would like him.,Happy
1007," Thats just crazy. He is my son second favorite, after transformers. I guess it worked out for stan though.",Happy
1007,Yes!  Do you like guitars?,Curious to dive deeper
1007,I love the sound of the guitar. Did you know Brian may uses coins for his picks.,Happy
1007,He probably gets a different sound from using them.  He also holds a phd in astrophysics.  Incredible!,Happy
1007,I bet he wouldnt be smashing guitars like matthew bellamy. He holds the record  for most smashed guitars on tour.,Happy
1007,Nice!  do you use facebook?,Surprised
1007,I do use facebook.  I heard that iceland is actually rewriting their constitution using facebook.,Happy
1007,That is pretty cool!  Did you hear about that Facebook promotion that Burger King was running?,Happy
1007,I heard about it after the fact. I would have deleted all my friends. Lol.,Happy
1007,I would have too!  I can't believe there are more than 2.2 billion active users on facebook.  Incredible.  It's been fun chatting!,Happy
1007,Yeah it has and I cant believe it either. Have a good day.,Neutral
1008," Hi, how are you?",Happy
1008,I'm just relaxing and playing my guitar. It has six strings and I'm using a guitar pick.,Happy
1008,Nice. Have you ever set speakers on fire?,Curious to dive deeper
1008," I have not! Have you? I often play the f chord, which is also the same as the dialtone.",Happy
1008,I have not. I cannot play the guitar. How long have you played for?,Curious to dive deeper
1008," It has been about 15 years. Mine is average sized, but I would love t play the world's smallest guitar that Cornell built.",Happy
1008,I would be afraid I would break it.... Brian May had a degree in astrophysics.,Surprised
1008,Brian May seems like the kind of guy that would like Iron Man. Jon Favreau did a great job directing that film.,Happy
1008,Brian May also uses coins as a guitard pick. I wonder which one he uses?,Curious to dive deeper
1008,His ability to build guitars from old parts around the house is impressive.,Surprised
1008,Astoria is a floating house boat that Pink Floyd turned into a recording studio. That was not in their bio!,Surprised
1008,I love pink floyd almost as much as I love Tony Stark. His engineering talents are out of this world!,Happy
1008,So is MySpace turning down an noffer to buy facebook for $75M. What were they thinking?,Curious to dive deeper
1008,That is nuts! Facebook has been so popular since mark zuckerberg started it in 2004.,Surprised
1008,He is color blind so he made the primary color blue. Who knew?,Surprised
1008,Interesting! Can you imagine if the like button said awesome instead? that would be odd.,Curious to dive deeper
1008,I dont think it would have the same effect if it said awesome... Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
1008,I don't. I much prefer like and I think the many users would agree. It is a huge news resource for 30% of users.,Happy
1008,I feel like 30% is too many people using it for news. What happened to CNN or Fox or MSNBC?,Surprised
1008," Very true. It is irresponsible to rely on social media for news. But it is relevant in divorce, as 1/3 of filings refer to facebook.",Sad
1008,Nice chatting with you.,Curious to dive deeper
1009," Hi,  Do you like learning about alternative energy?  Did you know that more than 80 % of the earth's natural forests have been destroyed?  That is sad.",Sad
1009,It is interesting. That's very sad! There will be virtually no helium left by the end of the century.,Surprised
1009,Do you believe in aliens?,Curious to dive deeper
1009," No, do you? I heard there is a united nations ambassador to extraterrestrials! That would be an interesting job. ",Surprised
1009," I wonder how you get paid for that, salary or hourly?",Curious to dive deeper
1009,Comission; per alien encounter.,Happy
1009," Oh, okay.  What's your favorite planet?  Is it Earth or something else?  I think I like Jupiter for how large and beautiful it is with rings.",Curious to dive deeper
1009,I like venus. It's the only one that moves clockwise.,Happy
1009,Venus doesn't have seasons.  I wonder what the temperature is like.  Probably a little warmer than here now!,Curious to dive deeper
1009,Definitely! Pluto is no longer considered a planet.,Surprised
1009,I heard that.  Apparently there is a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph in 2000 F weather.  That sounds dangerous!,Surprised
1009," Yeah, I wouldn't want to visit there! ",Surprised
1009,Are you a Star Wars fan?  Did you know that Lucas' wife had a large impact on changes to the original Star Wars film including Obi Wan's death.  She got an academy award for editing the film and George didn't get one for directing,Curious to dive deeper
1009," I had no idea, that's surprising! The first movie was in 1977.",Surprised
1009,James Earl Jones is a gem in the movies.  Did you know that he only spent 2.5 hours recording all of darth vader's lines for Star Wars and was paid $7500.,Curious to dive deeper
1009,That's wild! especially since the franchise is worth $65 billion.,Surprised
1009," I'm sure he's made more since.  In 2013, they dubbed Star Wars in Navajo which turned out to be the first major film in a Native American language.  That is impressive.",Happy
1009,That's pretty cool! Lucas is a billionaire because he kept merchandising rights.,Surprised
1009,That was smart thinking!  They had the interesting prequel trilogy concept too which was a different way of presenting the movies.,Curious to dive deeper
1009," Yes, it sure was. I learned a lot about Star Wars from you. Thanks for chatting!",Happy
1009,Thanks to you too!  Hope you get to see the next Star Wars movie when it comes out!,Happy
1010,Do you watch Star Wars?,Curious to dive deeper
1010,I love Star Wars! It's my favorite movie series.,Happy
1010,So have you heard of Planet Hoth and Tatooine?,Curious to dive deeper
1010," Yes, I am very familiar with those planets. Tattooine in particular is one of the most important planets in Star Wars, being the home of Jabba the Hutt, Luke Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker, and Obi-Wan Kenobi's retirement.",Neutral
1010,Interesting. I guess Hoth is too cold and Tattooine is too hot. I guess there is a climate scientist who is studying that.,Curious to dive deeper
1010," Yes, there are several climate scientists who study the climate of planets, for example Scott Denning.",Neutral
1010," Quite interesting that he would study fictional planets, though. He seems to be studying why the climate is a certain way, for example, what caused the frozen wilderness on Tatooine",Surprised
1010," Actually, Hoth was the frozen planet.",Surprised
1010,Right. Why is Tatooine so hot?,Curious to dive deeper
1010," Tatooine has two suns, that may be part of the reason it is so hot. There is probably some carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as well.",Curious to dive deeper
1010," Boy, where I live the one sun I have is hot enough. Glad we do not have two suns! It is nearly unbearable here in the summers of Arizona.",Fearful
1010," It gets hot in the summer here on the Mid-Atlantic coast, but winter can get very cold, like Hoth.",Neutral
1010,Denning says that Hoth might have gotten so cold and ended up with very litle CO2 because of a collision on Hoth's continents,Surprised
1010,That makes sense. That is part of how Earth experienced its ice ages.,Curious to dive deeper
1010,All of these theories are very complex for me. I never really thought about the science behind Star Wars.,Curious to dive deeper
1010," Tatooine and Hoth may be extreme examples of planets, but Star Wars is known for its variety of interesting and unique planets. One of the most striking planets is Coruscant. The entire planet is one giant city!",Happy
1010,Interesting! I'm  fascinated with our own solar system. Did you know that planet uranus rolls and doesn't spin?,Curious to dive deeper
1010," ""Rolling"" is just a sideways variant of ""spinning."" It's all a matter of perspective. However I think the coolest planet is Saturn, it has beautiful rings.",Neutral
1010," Uranus spins differently than all the other planets. And Venus is different too. It does not tilt, and has no seasons. It is the only planet that rotates clock wise.",Surprised
1010,All the planets are different in their own way. However I find Venus fascinating. The ultraviolet radiation from the sun separated the water in Venus' atmosphere into pure oxygen and hydrogen.,Curious to dive deeper
1010," Yes, of course, all the planets are different in some way. And there are many more outside of our galaxy that we can't even fathom. Astronomers detected building blocks of life in a planetary system some 455 light years away.",Surprised
1010,It would be interesting if any of those planets actually did have life! The United Nations does have an official extraterrestrial ambassador if aliens ever attempt contact.,Curious to dive deeper
1011,I think that Hoth can be a ice world. That would be cool.,Curious to dive deeper
1011," And Tatooine a desert, sounds like they are perfect opposites!",Neutral
1011," By the end of this century , we wont have any helium. Thats scary.",Neutral
1011," It really is, I was listening to a podcast, they mentioned helium in the air prevents particles from colliding that could develop tiny black holes.",Neutral
1011,Wow thats cool. Cant believe star wars came out in 1977. Old as heck.,Neutral
1011," Yeah, and when I talk to some teenagers these days they think I, II and III are the OG.  ",Neutral
1011,Thats right! lol Im trying to think who James earl is. only paid 7500 buck. Not bad for 3 hours  but compared to the actors and actresses pay now! What a difference,Happy
1011,He said the most memorable lines in all of the films!,Neutral
1011," So I was reading, the earth is 4.5 million years old smh. Its hard to imagine that on a timelapse gravitating with the moon and sun.",Curious to dive deeper
1011," It is old, and in the beginning an earth day was only 5.5 hours.",Neutral
1011,Wow. It really gets me thinking about 80 percent of that natural forest been destroyed. And the world is running out of resources smh.,Neutral
1011,We have done a lot of damage to out planet in our short time here as humans.,Neutral
1011,71 percent is covered with water already. We got to get a ticket to mars with elon musk lol,Neutral
1011,Musk might single handedly save Earth.,Neutral
1011,The prices of the tickets will be like 200k. Speaking of money. Star wars franchise is estimated at 65 billion dollars,Curious to dive deeper
1011,And Star Wars is only going to grow.  Lucas gave up more directing fee to keep all the merchandising rights... made him pretty rich.,Neutral
1011,Yes. I like how Lucas swerved on 20th century fox and in return became a billionaire,Neutral
1011,His wife has even won awards for her work on the movies.,Neutral
1011,People couldnt wait to see star wars when it came out. The dubbed it in navajo into a native american language.,Neutral
1011,Wasnt it the first film to have that done too?,Neutral
1011," I believe it was. A Franchise like that, no one wants to miss out. ",Neutral
1011,Very true.  It is a pretty iconic film.,Neutral
1011,Well nice chatting with you. Take care.,Neutral
1011," You too!  Have a great night, sleep well!",Neutral
1012," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
1012," Good, just happy to be living on planet Earth and not on part of the 71% that is covered with water.",Curious to dive deeper
1012,Me too! Like Water World. I do wish we had that 80% of forests that are now gone.,Sad
1012," Me too.  But its hard for trees to grow in some areas, like the polar regions that are covered in ice.",Curious to dive deeper
1012,Agreed. When the earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long.,Surprised
1012,That's pretty neat.  That would probably have made the tides crazy that are caused by the gravitational interaction between the Earth and the Moon.,Curious to dive deeper
1012," The interior is made of solid iron core, a liquid otter core that generates the earth's magnetic field.",Surprised
1012,I did not know that.  I did know that Jupiter saves the Earth from many asteroid impacts every year.,Curious to dive deeper
1012," That Jupiter is a standup planet. Always there when you need someone to block asteroids... Also there in case of an alien invasion, the UN's ambassador to extraterrestrials!",Surprised
1012," I'd love that job.  Visiting Jupiter would be cool too, but that is impossible due to the intense radiation.",Curious to dive deeper
1012,Yeah. The earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century. I wonder if we could make more of it in a lab? Is it even needed?,Curious to dive deeper
1012,No more birthday balloons huh?  I wonder if they used helium to make some of those strange creatures talk in Star Wars.,Curious to dive deeper
1012,Could be. I bet we would be surprised in all they did to make movies. Star wars was the first major film to be dubbed into Navajo in 2013. Seems like it should have been done before that...,Surprised
1012," Yeah, you would think.  Apparently the entire saga is told from the perspective of R2D2.  I never knew that.",Curious to dive deeper
1012,Really? I didn't know that. I didn't know Poe was Guatemalan either.,Surprised
1012," Huh, interesting trivia fact.  I certainly didn't know that.  Another interesting fact is that the Star Wars franchise is worth an estimated $65 billion.  That's a nice chunk of change.",Curious to dive deeper
1012,Right? James earl jones only spent 2.5 hours recording Darth Vaders lines for Star Wars.,Surprised
1012," I had no idea.  I forgot he wasn't actually in the costume.  Star Wars is truly an American epic, and Darth Vader is iconic.",Curious to dive deeper
1012,I agree! He did it for only $7500 too!!!,Surprised
1012," What a bargain!  Well, it's been nice chatting with you.",Neutral
1012,Nice chatting with you!,Happy
1013,Hi do you travel much?,Curious to dive deeper
1013," quite a bit, have you ever been to Japan?",Curious to dive deeper
1013,I have not but I hear it can get expensive if you travel there by car,Curious to dive deeper
1013,Yeah it can cost you up to $300 in tolls,Curious to dive deeper
1013,Yeah that is quite a bit. In Mackinac Island there are no motorized vehicles allowed,Curious to dive deeper
1013,Yeah they get around with horses and bikes and stuff like that,Curious to dive deeper
1013,Yeah much better. Did tou know the dutch are creating a fast bus?,Curious to dive deeper
1013,Yeah it is supposed to go as fast as 160 mph,Curious to dive deeper
1013,Yeah pretty awesome do you know who is the first kind to travel the world?,Curious to dive deeper
1013,Yes that was king kalakaua of Hawaii,Curious to dive deeper
1013,Yes. Do you have a favorite type of shoes?,Curious to dive deeper
1013,I love my runners and you?,Curious to dive deeper
1013,Me too. Ballet dancers go through 4 pair s of them in a week,Curious to dive deeper
1013,Wow that is a lot of shoes and I imagine a lot of money as well,Curious to dive deeper
1013,Yeah. 5000 year old shoes are more durable than the ones today,Curious to dive deeper
1013,WOw we need to crack that secret. DO you know how to keep the shoes fresh?,Curious to dive deeper
1013,Yeah you can use tea bags which is pretty genius,Curious to dive deeper
1013,Yeah I know. Do you like shirts?,Curious to dive deeper
1013,I love them . DO you know how the polo shirts originated?,Curious to dive deeper
1013,Yes that was all thanks to the famous tennis player Rene Lacoste,Curious to dive deeper
1013,Yes and then everyone followed suit,Curious to dive deeper
1014," Hello there, do you travel much for work or for fun?",Curious to dive deeper
1014,I do travel for fun at times. How about yourself. Do you travel at all?,Happy
1014," I use to travel a bit when I was younger, but don't really have the means or the time to now, but I do like to take a small trip every summer. ",Neutral
1014,I heard that Iceland has no public rail service whatsoever.,Curious to dive deeper
1014,I think I have heard that from a friend of mine that traveled there as well.  Sounds like it is just flights to get around to the major cities.,Curious to dive deeper
1014,That is strange but then again Iceland is a small country.,Surprised
1014," Yeah it sure is, speaking of small, did you know that the first king to travel all of the way around the world was king Kalakaua from Hawaii?",Curious to dive deeper
1014,No. I didn't know this what an interesting fact. I didn't even know that Hawaii had a king.,Surprised
1014," I thought that was really interesting as well.  Did you hear about the travel rules on another island, Mackinac island?",Curious to dive deeper
1014,No. What about Mackinac Island?,Curious to dive deeper
1014," I guess they banned all motorized vehicles there over hundred years ago, and it still stands today. ",Curious to dive deeper
1014,That is very bizarre. How do people get around in that island?,Surprised
1014,They mostly travel around by bikes and old horse drawn carriages I guess.,Neutral
1014,Wow. That is interesting. I guess that island has difficulty adjusting to the modern times.,Surprised
1014,Yeah well I think they want to keep it that way to be honest.  I think it keeps that old fashioned feel.,Curious to dive deeper
1014,You could be right because I believe that people there are use to do things a certain way and they don't want to change it. I can understand that.,Neutral
1014,Yeah I think it is really cool to be honest.  Have you ever wanted to visit Japan?,Curious to dive deeper
1014," Yes I always wanted to visit Japan but I never had the time to do so. How about you, have you visited Japan at all?",Curious to dive deeper
1014," No, I would really like to go, despite the flight, but I heard that they have expensive tolls across the whole country. ",Curious to dive deeper
1014,Yes you're right!!! I heard that it costs more than $300 to travel across the entire country.,Curious to dive deeper
1014," Yeah it does!  But, I have heard that the roads there are all in really nice shape and it is a breeze to drive. ",Curious to dive deeper
1014,That is very nice. It was nice chatting with you as well and I hope you have a great night!!! Thanks,Happy
1014," Same to you, I hope you have a good night!",Happy
1015,Do you like to travel?,Happy
1015," Yes, I like to travel.  I find it exciting to explore new places.  What about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1015,I like travelling too. It's also a very long trip.,Happy
1015," When I travelled around Japan on my recent trip abroad, I noticed that all their roads are toll roads and it cost me $300.00 to travel across the country.",Surprised
1015,But is it nice place to visit.,Happy
1015," Yes, it was.  Do you know the frst king to travel around the word was King Kalakaua of Hawaii?",Curious to dive deeper
1015," Yes, I think his 1874 travels had made him the first reigning monarch to visit America and the first honoree of state dinner at the White House. Is it right?",Sad
1015," Yes, I think you're correct.  I wonder what type of shoes who wore on that long trip?",Curious to dive deeper
1015,I think activity shoe is the best one to go on long trip.,Happy
1015,You're probably right about that.  I read somewhere that 5000 year old shoes perform better than these modern shoes.  Maybe he was wearing some antiques..lol,Surprised
1015," Of course, no quality at that time. When old is best for every time. ",Happy
1015," I'm currently living in my Ugg boots until Winter is officially over, they have a complex construction and may cost a few hundred bucks, but they're worth it.  Keep my footsies warm and dry.  Do you spend alot on shoes?",Curious to dive deeper
1015,I have not spent a lot of shoes.,Happy
1015," In summertime, I usually just wear your basic sandal.  Which is nothing more than a thin sole and simple strap, but Wintertime I feel you need to spend extra money for a good quality boot to keep your feet warm.  Do you do any hiking?",Curious to dive deeper
1015,I was regularly use shoes only. I have not been so far. Do you like hiking?,Happy
1015,Well at least you wear shoes.  lol I like to go hiking.  There's been a new hiking/ mountain biking trail dedicated in the power line's right of way by my house.  I was wondering if you'd like to join me on a hike?,Curious to dive deeper
1015," Definitely, What is your opinion about shirt?",Happy
1015," That's cool, I'll give you a call later and setup a time and day for our hike.  I wear shirts daily, ususally the button down version, mainly for my work.",Happy
1015,I like casual type shirts because i am a conservative.,Happy
1015," I hear you on that one, I'd like to live in Hawaii where they wear the Aloha shirt as their official business/ office attire.  Wouldn't that be nice?",Surprised
1015,Each one depends on each and every person's mood. Is this right?,Happy
1015," Sure does.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you.  I'll give you a call later this week and setup our hiking date.  ",Happy
1015," Okay, thank you very much to chat with me. ",Happy
1015," Talk to you later, friend.",Happy
1016,Hello! Do you enjoy mountain biking? Would you ever consider riding under power lines?,Curious to dive deeper
1016," At times, your near power lines.  It is unavoidable in modern life.  I would not stay under them for a long time. A bike trail under them would not appeal to me.",Neutral
1016," Yeah it seems a bit crazy to me. In Maryland, they have created a six mile trail that follows the power lines. ",Surprised
1016," Now, if this Dagnija Kreslins is supper annoying about people peeping in her windows, I might just go.  Six miles under a line... some times in the rain you can here them buzz.",Neutral
1016,Yeah that would be concerning. Do you enjoy running? Runners are going to use the trail because the dirt path is easier on their knees. I love running!,Curious to dive deeper
1016,Not a runner.  It some times gets annoying to mix use a single track.  Cooperation with utilities seems a good idea.  Way to go Gretchen Bolton.  Nice T shirt.,Happy
1016,What is your favorite mode of travel? The Dutch are currently creating a commuter bus that will travel at 160 mph...,Curious to dive deeper
1016," Not sure I want to go 160 mph in a yellow bus and a cranky Dutch man at the wheel.  My favorite mode is motorcycle, no luggage, no plans, back at work in one week.",Happy
1016," That does sound nice! I agree though, 160 mph is too fast. I prefer cars. In Iceland, there is no public rail system and people often fly between cities. I'm not a fan of flight. ",Curious to dive deeper
1016,I dont understand Japan.  That is easy to say.  $300 to travel across the country.  Seems like a lot.  Maybe flying is safer.,Surprised
1016," Yeah that's too expensive! I also enjoy walking, since it helps me get around and doesn't cost a thing. Did you know that putting dry tea bags in smelly shoes can remove odors? ",Curious to dive deeper
1016," I did know that.  Coffee grounds used or fresh works well too.  If you are walking along a ridge line, you are easy to see.  Walk about 3/4 from the bottom.  much stealthier.",Neutral
1016," Interesting! That is good information to know. I prefer to wear tennis shoes, because they are comfortable and I could take them on the Montgomery County trail. ",Curious to dive deeper
1016," Ever have a pair of shoes that you can not stand.  Just something wrong with them.  Turns out, 5000 year old shoes perform better in some respects than modern shoes.",Surprised
1016,I have. I wonder what makes those old shoes better. Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shoes in a week. That would be pricey!,Surprised
1016,I have never wanted to wear ballet shoes.  It looks painful.  One look at their feet and you will know.  People do odd things for fashion.  maybe modern shoes are too fashionable.,Curious to dive deeper
1016,I'd agree with that. Fashion shoes are also too expensive. Some high fashion shoes can sell for thousands of dollars a pair.,Disgusted
1016,$15 per pair sounds about right.  Way to go Stephon Marbury.,Neutral
1016," Yep that is the perfect amount to spend on shoes! I also think I could live in Hawaii, because the office business attire is the aloha shirt. ",Curious to dive deeper
1016," In Jamaica, it is a dress shirt and dress shorts.  with black socks and dress shoes. I have seen the layered look with popped collars before. Funny guys.",Happy
1016," Wow that's quite the look! Well it was good talking to you. Enjoy your travels, however you chose to get there. ",Neutral
1016,Hope your better than traveling with Billy Mays. Pallbearers with blue shirts and khaki pants.,Happy
1016,That's an odd look,Neutral
1017,What do you enjoy watching?,Neutral
1017," I like hospital shows or drama type shows.  Did you know that there is a website where  you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas.  That might be interesting.  I would love to hear ""The War of the Worlds""",Surprised
1017,Do you listen to the radio often?,Neutral
1017," Not really but I think dramas on the radio might be interesting.  I read that Hugh Laurie is the highest paid actor ever for a tv drama.  He earns $700,000 per episode on  House.",Surprised
1017," Given his skills, I can see why",Neutral
1017,I also saw that Michael Caine became an actor just because the prettiest girls were in his drama class in highschool,Happy
1017," Despite his reasons, you have to admit his acting is great",Neutral
1017," Yes for sure.  There are so many different types of drama.  For instance radio drama, drama performed on stage, tv drama, movies, and even drama set to music as in a Opera.  I more or less like them all.",Happy
1017," I like how you can divide drama into comedy and tragedy, both bringing depth to the story",Neutral
1017,Yes that is very interesting.  Do you like Steven Spielberg?  He is considered to be one of the founding pioneers of the new Hollywood era and he is one of the most popular directors and producers in history,Surprised
1017,Who doesn't? Many of his films are now classics,Neutral
1017," Yes, they say that summer was considered at one time to be a bad time to release a movie in the theater because of low sales until Steven Spielberg released Jaws",Surprised
1017," That just proved there isn't periods of low sales, just low quality movies",Neutral
1017,Right exactly.  I just saw something I didn't know before.  Steven Spielberg actually played the clarinet in the Jaws soundtrack.,Surprised
1017,Don't you just love it when the director or producer plays a direct part in their film like marvel's stan lee,Happy
1017,Oh I know.  I would always look for him in his movies.  This was kind of funny.  when Steven Spielberg rode Jurrasic Park ride on opening day he requested that he was let off before the 84 foot drop.,Happy
1017,Which is basically when you get on,Neutral
1017,Wow it happens that fast?  I have never ridden it before.  I also saw that he makes millions still from Star Wars because of some bet he made with George Lucas in 1977.  I wonder that was all about?,Surprised
1017,They simply wagered a part of their earnings of their film,Neutral
1017,Oh ok that makes sense.  He sounds like a caring person.  I saw that after filming the Goonies he flew the entire cast out to Hawaii and surprised the director Richard Donner with a cookout,Surprised
1017," Sounds like a great guy to know. In any case, thanks for chatting.",Neutral
1018,What do you enjoy watching?,Neutral
1018,I really love musicals. I am a huge fan of Mama Mia!! I love the music from ABBA sprinkled though it. How about you? Do you have any favorites?,Happy
1018,mama Mia is good. I enjoy watching shows on broadway. So sad hamlet is booked like forever,Sad
1018," Oh wow, I didn't know that. I have never see a show on Broadway. I have never even been to New York. Meryl Streep is one of my favorite people. She is insanely talented.",Happy
1018,Who is she? Could you tell me more?,Neutral
1018,She is an actress who has been nominated for 18 academy awards.,Curious to dive deeper
1018,Wow! What is she best known for?,Surprised
1018," Well, I love her in Mama Mia but she has many many movies. She has only won 3 academy awards which put her in second place for most awards.",Curious to dive deeper
1018,Personally I generally follow filmakers like spielberg more than actors,Neutral
1018," Yes, he is amazing! I loved the movie Jaws! It scared the living daylights out of me though.",Curious to dive deeper
1018,It is a shame how it indirectly led to the massacre of real sharks though,Neutral
1018," Yeah, right. I know that summertime used to be known for slow movie attendance until they released Jaw in the summer and the sales went through the roof.",Curious to dive deeper
1018," It just proved there is not slow movie attendance, just bad movies",Neutral
1018," HA, yeah! Great point!",Curious to dive deeper
1018,Did you like any other of his movies?,Curious to dive deeper
1018,I like Jim Carrey a lot. He doesn't do dramas anymore because of his new found belief system.,Curious to dive deeper
1018,yes but at least he still does comedies. Comedy and tragedy are parts of the same coin which is drama,Neutral
1018," That is very true, I guess he wants to stay positive and that is why he stopped making dramas. Did you know that Hugh Laurie is the highest paid actor.",Surprised
1018," Considering his performance, I'm not surprised",Neutral
1018," Yeah, he makes $700,00 per episode! That is crazy!",Surprised
1018," But people are willing to pay for better acting I guess since the get more money though other means like ads. Anyway, thanks for taking your time to chat.",Neutral
1019,Hello! Do you like the watch Shark Week?,Happy
1019,I love Shark week!,Happy
1019,Did you know they've evolved earlier than dinosaurs and trees?,Happy
1019,I didn't know that.  I've heard that sharks can be trained like dogs to bark!,Happy
1019,Very interesting! You associate sharks with being vicious but they've saved sailors too besides dolphins.,Happy
1019,That's interesting!  I would like to see some video of where the Great White sharks congregate in the middle of the Pacific ocean in an area known as the white shark cafe.,Happy
1019," I went snorkeling with sharks last month. Talk about a crazy time! We went out for 5.5 hours, which is how long a day was when earth formed.",Curious to dive deeper
1019,Wow. That would be fun I bet!  That must have been when the Earth was formed over 4.5 billion years ago?,Happy
1019,It was! They say earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century. No more crazy high pitched voices!,Surprised
1019,LOL On a sad note...more than 80 percent of the Earth's natural forests have already been destroyed.,Happy
1019,That is so sad! The UN appointed an ambassador to aliens lol.,Surprised
1019," lol  That's funny!  If Earth's entire history was viewed in a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds.  Such a short time.",Happy
1019,It really is the grand scheme of things! I wonder how long Apple's clothing line would have taken up in the time since they had one in 1986.,Happy
1019,I wonder if they are worth any money now as collectibles?  Rip Curl makes clothes in North Korea yet the label says China.  I wouldn't buy those because I've heard horror stories of North Korea factories and how they treat the people who work there.,Happy
1019,I agree I wouldn't too. I wouldn't buy clothes or cameras from that Alabama store either. They basically sell things found in unclaimed baggage!,Surprised
1019,Wow.  Talk about a business model.  lol  Pilgrims wore clothes that were full of color contrary to the sterotype of black and white.,Happy
1019,They only wore black for special occasions.,Surprised
1019,They didn't do a good job teaching us that in school.  They always showed pictures of them wearing black and white. lol,Happy
1019,I completely agree! They probably neglected to tell us a lot.,Surprised
1019,Jumping back to the Earth topic...Did you know that 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered with water?,Happy
1019,I didn't! Well have a good one!,Surprised
1020,How's it going? Do you think sharks are interesting? I never knew they were related to rays,Curious to dive deeper
1020," I have never met a shark that I didn't like. Personable, good at parties... Oh wait, that's dogs. Sorry. Don'T know much about sharks.",Neutral
1020," I always thought they were pretty cool, and scary, apparently sharks evolved earlier than dinosaurs",Neutral
1020," Sharks have been around longer than the trees. Sharks have an ancient wisdom from deep within the waters. One day they might reveal it to use. They are like people. shy, sassy, social",Neutral
1020," Yea sharks are really interesting, they can even be trained to bark like dogs",Surprised
1020," Is that true? Barking sharks?? I wonder what that sounds like. I figure that sharks would not make much noise. New Yorkers are more dangerous than sharks. New Yorkers can bark, too.",Neutral
1020," There's a place in the pacific where white sharks gather, I guess it's a shark version of NYC",Neutral
1020,They're up to something. We should check that out. I've heard that sharks are ticklish. Do they tickle each other?,Neutral
1020," I don't know, I wonder if not having ribs has anything to do with sharks being ticklish",Curious to dive deeper
1020," Sharks are sensitive types. In Indonesia, some fisherman have made them into pets. I wonder what pet sharks can do for fisherman",Neutral
1020," I don't know, I heard some sharks have rescued sailors like dolphins are known to do",Neutral
1020," I figured sharks would want a tasty meal, but maybe a friendship gives them a deeper sense of satisfaction. Sharks cannot live on meat alone. They need companionship on the high seas. ",Neutral
1020," Well they have a lot of space to look for it, the earth is 71% water",Neutral
1020," So much water, but we can't drink most of it. Would you want to live under the sea, like Homer Simpson? You could make many shark friends. ",Neutral
1020," Probably not, I love to live in the forest but unfortunately 80% of the earth's forests are gone",Neutral
1020," We can't blame that on the sharks, unfortunately. We done that. Not to spite the sharks, but still, we done it. ",Neutral
1020,Yes hopefully something will be done to help restore the forests that have been destroyed by people,Neutral
1020,We've only got 20% left to go. Some people see that as a challenge to be met. The sharks are better at caring for their environment. The undersea forests are still going strong,Neutral
1020," Yea, polar regions covered in ice don't have to worry about sharks melting them",Neutral
1020," If the sharks meeting in the Pacific are planning something in anticipation of the magnetic field reversing, maybe the sharks know about the caps melting. ",Neutral
1020," Maybe. Well I have to go, nice talking with you",Neutral
1021,Apparently Calvin Klein had a big presentation of his latest fashions.,Neutral
1021," Really, I imagine he has a lot of those.",Happy
1021," I think there is one big one each year.  The 2019 theme had a lot to do with the ocean, sharks and the like.",Neutral
1021,Sounds interesting I guess. I have never been one to really keep up on fashion to be honest.,Happy
1021,I understand.  One of the pieces was a T-shirt with a big open mouth shark showing its teeth.  It would be odd to pay Calvin Klein type money for a t-shirt.,Neutral
1021," Yeah to be honest, I buy most of my clothes at wal mart. Lol.",Happy
1021,I just ate at IHOP and a woman next to our booth was wearing Calvin Klein. That seemed like a fish out of water (no pun intended with the shark clothing comments before),Neutral
1021,Lol. I can speak on IHOP. I love that place. Best part. All those flavored syrups. Amazing.,Happy
1021,Yep. Did you know that sharks have no rib cage so their own weight can crush them on land.,Neutral
1021,Wow that is interesting to know. Have you heard about bulletproof clothing.,Happy
1021,I know about Kevlar.  Is there more news lately?,Neutral
1021,Apparently miguel cabarello a bulletproof clothing mogul actually shoots all his employees to test the quality of his products.,Happy
1021," Mercy.  I would need a HUGE bonus for that work function.  Speaking of clothing, Pilgrims wore colorful clothing and wore black and white only on special occasions.",Neutral
1021,I think it would be cool to work there. know they arent gonna just shoot somebody with a chance of it actually hurting them. At least then I could say I have been hot and survived.,Happy
1021,I would rather say I have not been shot.  Did you know that Apple had a clothing line in 1986?,Neutral
1021,I didnt know that. I have seen the shirts with the apple logo on them. I wastn aware that apple actually made the shirts though.,Happy
1021,Brands on clothing weren't so common back then.  Apple was a niche player so probably the people who wore the cloths were kind of snobbish about it.,Neutral
1021,Probably. I heard a story about a guy wearing 70 items of clothing to avoid a baggage charge at a chinese airport. Thats taking it a little far if you ask me.,Happy
1021,I can't imagine that many layers.  Every human society has worn clothing.  Some were revealing like grass skirts.,Neutral
1021,I don't think there's anything wrong with that!,Happy
1021,Yes.  Down with coconut bras!  Nice chatting with you.,Neutral
1022,do you like sharks?,Curious to dive deeper
1022,Yes I do. DId you know that they do not have rib cages?,Curious to dive deeper
1022,Yes so on land their body mass would crush them,Curious to dive deeper
1022,Yeah. And they are good at rescuing sailors as well,Curious to dive deeper
1022,Yeah they are like dolphins in that sense,Curious to dive deeper
1022," Yeah. ANd they are super old, came before trees and dinosaurs",Curious to dive deeper
1022," Yeah, Have you heard of the which sharks cafe?",Curious to dive deeper
1022,It is a place in the pacific where the sharks get together,Curious to dive deeper
1022,Yeah Did you know you can train them to bark like dogs?,Curious to dive deeper
1022," That is so cool, wonder how they figured that out",Curious to dive deeper
1022,I wonder too. Did you know they have five to seven gill slits on the side?,Curious to dive deeper
1022,Yes and they are huge. Do you like colorful clothing?,Curious to dive deeper
1022,I do just like the pilgrims. Do you know when they wear black clothing?,Curious to dive deeper
1022,Yeah that is only reserved for special occassions,Curious to dive deeper
1022,Yeah. Do you know how people in fashion can tell if you need your clothes tailored?,Curious to dive deeper
1022,Yes they look for collar gaps in clothes,Curious to dive deeper
1022,Yeah. In ALabama there is a sotre that sells stuff lost at airports,Curious to dive deeper
1022,Nice I guess you can find some odd things there,Curious to dive deeper
1022,Yeah. Did you know Apple had a clothing line?,Curious to dive deeper
1022,Yes that was back in 1986 but not sure what happened to it,Curious to dive deeper
1022,Yeah me neither but pretty interesting,Curious to dive deeper
1023,Do you watch a lot of dramas?,Curious to dive deeper
1023," Sometimes I do.  I used to watch the show House.  It was good. I learned recently that Hugh Laurie made the most money ever for a tv drama actor. He got $700,000 per episode.",Neutral
1023," I used to watch that show as well, that's a lot of money per episode.",Surprised
1023,It definitely is.  What do you think of mimes?,Neutral
1023,I've never watched a mime do a full performance so I don't know what to think of them.,Curious to dive deeper
1023,I've seen them on tv.  They say that mime is a form of drama. I actually never thought about it like that until recently.,Neutral
1023,I know there have been a few famous mimes so there has to be something to that art form.,Curious to dive deeper
1023,True.  Do you like opera?  It's another form of drama.,Neutral
1023," I have never seen an opera, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1023,No I haven't.  I haven't seen a ballet either and supposedly it's a form of drama too.  I guess my exposure to drama is limited to tv and movies.,Neutral
1023," I have been to the ballet, it's amazing that you can see the storytelling in the dance itseld.",Surprised
1023,Yeah?  Is it like a play of sorts?,Neutral
1023,Yes if you replace the dialogue with dancing it kind of works that way.,Neutral
1023,Sounds nice!  Have you ever listened to any radio dramas?,Neutral
1023,I have not but I have listened to a podcast that was made to resemble one of those.,Neutral
1023," Some of them are pretty good.  Hey, have you heard of Michael Caine?",Neutral
1023," Yes, he's a great actor. He was awesome in the new Batman movies as Alfred.",Happy
1023,I agree!  Did you know that the whole reason he became an actor was because all of the pretty girls were in drama class at his school?,Neutral
1023,I would imagine that's the reason a lot of actors got their start!,Happy
1023,You're probably right!  Do you like Jim Carrey?,Neutral
1023," I do, I liked his earlier stuff. He's gotten a little strange now.",Surprised
1023,He's not doing dramas any more because his belief system prevents him from doing them.,Neutral
1024,Did you read about the 6 foot 10 inch tall tennis player?,Curious to dive deeper
1024,No I didn't.  Where's he from?,Curious to dive deeper
1024,He is American.  He played the longest duration match at Wimbledon in history of 11 hours 5 minutes,Neutral
1024,Wow!  I wonder if he won.,Curious to dive deeper
1024," No. Even though he has a booming serve, he lost.",Neutral
1024,Too bad.  I don't know much about tennis but i have heard of Wimbledon.  Was that where the match was?,Curious to dive deeper
1024," I was mistaken, He won that one.  It is in England.  The Queen sometimes attends and other royals do also.",Neutral
1024,That's pretty cool.  I've heard of Serena Williams playing there.,Neutral
1024," In 1998, she and her sister claimed they could beat any man ranked 200 or worse.  A guy who was ranked 203 beat them badly.",Neutral
1024,That's good to know.  I think she is ranked behind Stefi Graf and Martina navratilova.,Neutral
1024,She has had some trouble coming back after delivering her child.,Neutral
1024,I don't like the yelling she does when she hits the ball.  Some people consider that cheating.,Neutral
1024,It certainly is distracting.  Others have imitated it also.  Even kids imitate their heroes.,Neutral
1024,Yes they do.  Did you know that up until 1978 a player could use anything as racket?,Neutral
1024,No.  That is radical.  I wonder if any peculiar things were used?,Curious to dive deeper
1024,I would like to see a Wimbledon match from before 1978 to see if anything odd was used!,Happy
1024,I can't think of anything that would be better.  Perhaps a baseball bat for serving.,Neutral
1024,Maybe a light frying pan?,Neutral
1024,Good thought.  There must be something that would produce more speed and still be accurate.  I would rather be hit with a tennis racket than a frying pan,Neutral
1024," Me too!  Speaking of being hit, did you know that the NFL is not a sport but an entertainment industry?",Curious to dive deeper
1024,I agree with that.  That's why their mishandling of the National Anthem controversy was so costly!  Say I think I have to go.  My Panda is calling me.,Neutral
1025," Hello, do you like tennis?",Curious to dive deeper
1025," Hi! Yes, I played when I was a kid but don't play anymore, do you?",Curious to dive deeper
1025," I played a little as a youth, but I had no talent for it. I enjoy watching a good match, though.",Curious to dive deeper
1025," Do you have a favorite tennis player you like to watch? I saw that the quarterfinalist Gael Monfils beat Roger Federer after learning how to play just days earlier, how is that possible!",Surprised
1025," My all time favorite is John McEnroe. Regarding Gael Monfils, wow! What an achievement. I guess Tennis skill translates to ping pong.",Curious to dive deeper
1025," Yeah, whatever it is, they have great hand eye coordination! I'm not familiar with John McEnroe. Serena Williams is also a great player, they beat people ranked 200 or worse in tennis!",Surprised
1025," John McEnroe was a genius at Tennis. Unfortunately, his temper often got the best of him. Serena Williams is great, but in my opinion she plays in an era without a great depth of talent. In the past, the skill of many players was very close to the ability of those at the very top.",Curious to dive deeper
1025," Did he yell at the refs, launch the tennis racket into the ground? Oh, that's an interesting point! Even if she couldn't play anymore, she's the co-owner of the Miami Dolphins, so I think she has her future aligned for her.",Surprised
1025," Yes, McEnroe was a terrible sportsman, but a great player. Serena has certainly achieved success.",Curious to dive deeper
1025," Not only that, she speaks fluent French and Italian! I wish I spoke a different language as well. If I had to choose one, I'd choose French, the romance language, as some like to call, what would you choose?",Curious to dive deeper
1025," Either language is a romance language as they both are derived from Latin, the language of the Romans. If I had to choose, I would choose Italian, I guess. But learning either would be fun and engaging. It is impressive that Serena can speak both.",Curious to dive deeper
1025," Good point! Even with her success and fame, she's ranked as only 95th in the world but she did go on to win the Australian open against Maria Sharapova, I wonder what ranking she is?",Curious to dive deeper
1025," Maria Sharapova was briefly ranked number 1 in the World. She has since retired, I believe. It seems like the best players reach a peak, then fall back in the rankings, only to rise to the top again. ",Curious to dive deeper
1025," Oh I see, she even won a tournament while being two months pregnant! I wonder if she knew she was pregnant at the time because is that safe to do?",Curious to dive deeper
1025," I believe she did know. It seems to me that there was controversy at the time whether she should be allowed to do it. I'm not qualified to judge. I'm just glad things, apparently, turned out okay.",Curious to dive deeper
1025," Me too, but if things hand't, I imagine she might've received negative backlash for her actions. Those games are entertaining but I do enjoy Bill Nye ""The Science Guy, he actually got his big break by winning a Steve Martin lookalike contest, I don't think there's a resemblance, do you see it?",Curious to dive deeper
1025," I guess I see a mild resemblance. I've seen Bill Nye, but don't know much about him. I know he is really an engineer, not a scientist. But that doesn't mean he can teach people about science.",Curious to dive deeper
1025," Yeah some people who are scientist or engineers aren't really teachers, they know the stuff but don't know how to translate that into knowledge and education. I think Bill Nye does a great job of educating people who are clueless about things, I also thing Gordon Ramsay is an excellent teacher as well. Got any favorite teachers?",Curious to dive deeper
1025," I am a teacher. I'm not a great one, but on my best days I'm pretty good. The best teacher I ever had was a high school government teacher. Her name was Mrs. Marks, she was a Marxist. I am very conservative. Despite our differences, she was very influential. Gordon Ramsay can be a bully, no?",Curious to dive deeper
1025," Oh that's awesome! That's very respectable, I always thing people who can challenge my opinions and thoughts and I end up liking the person are worthy of respect and praise. I think his intentions are pure though, but he explains things very well",Happy
1025,He certainly is successful. He has two or three shows on Fox. I've enjoyed talking to you!,Curious to dive deeper
1025,Have a great day!,Happy
1026," Hi, are you a tennis fan?",Curious to dive deeper
1026,hello.,Happy
1026,I try to watch tennis when I can but I don't follow it too much.,Neutral
1026,Yeah me either really.,Happy
1026,I enjoy watching some of the major tournaments including Wimbledon. I did watch that super long match John Isner had.,Happy
1026,It wasnt 11 hours long was it.,Happy
1026,It was but it was spread out over a couple days. They had to suspend play a few times.,Neutral
1026,That is the longest match in history if Im not mistaken.,Happy
1026," It was, it was an earlier round match to, not ever for the championship!",Surprised
1026,I used to be pretty good at table tennis myself,Happy
1026,I played table tennis a bit but only casually. I never had regular access to a table to get a lot better.,Neutral
1026,Did you know that a black man won the 1st us open tennis title.,Happy
1026,Yes it was Arthur Ashe who is a legendary tennis player,Happy
1026,Really. Its sad that no black man has won one wince.,Happy
1026,Yes I would be curious to know if any other black players have come close or if there has been a lack of black male tennis players since Ashe won.,Curious to dive deeper
1026,Im not sure. I will have to look it up later.,Happy
1026,The Williams sisters are two black athletes who have dominated the tennis scene for years however.,Happy
1026,Thats true. Especially Serena.,Happy
1026,I would bet that Serena could probably beat a few of the men on the circuit!,Happy
1026,I dont know. She got beaten pretty good by Karsten braasch and he was ranked 203rd,Happy
1026,I'm sure it's not easy but maybe a lower ranked player. It was nice talking tennis with you.,Curious to dive deeper
1027," Hi , do you watch tennis?",Curious to dive deeper
1027,Can't really say that I do. DOn't know the sport well. You?,Neutral
1027,I used to follow it but not so much now. DO you know the association between tennis and polo shirts?,Curious to dive deeper
1027,I have no idea. Is that originally a tennis shirt? Seems pretty stylish for sportswear.,Neutral
1027,Yeah it was invented by a tennis player by the name of Rene Lacoste,Curious to dive deeper
1027," Oh, that Lacoste. I got ya. That's interesting. ",Neutral
1027,Yeah pretty interesting correlation. Once they had to use a helicopter to dry the field during the US Open,Curious to dive deeper
1027," That seems excessive, but I guess they needed a quick solution to the problem. Bring in the helicopters!",Neutral
1027,Yup difficult times call for difficult measures I guess. Do you know how long was the longest tennis game?,Curious to dive deeper
1027,The longest match? I have no idea.,Neutral
1027,Well it lasted for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days,Curious to dive deeper
1027,What? Three days? Did the fans watch the whole thing? That's crazy. They got their money's worth.,Neutral
1027,I am not sure but everyone must have been really tired. No balc guy has won the US Open since 1968,Curious to dive deeper
1027,Tennis is the sport of the wealthy and there is an imbalance in wealth. The sport will change. The Williams sisters have done well.,Neutral
1027,They have done amazing. Serena is such a star. Did you know she speaks 3 languages?,Curious to dive deeper
1027,I guess she travels and has lived different places. A bright capable person. She is determined to succeed.,Neutral
1027,For sure. And she is a business woman too as she co-owns the Miami Dolphins,Curious to dive deeper
1027,Smart investment. That'll pay off in years to come. She probably will have a great life after tennis too.,Neutral
1027,I am sure she will. She won her 23rd grand slam when she was 2 months pregnant,Curious to dive deeper
1027," Astonishing. She is unstoppable. Even pregnant. I wonder what her kid will grow up to do. Anyway, nice chat!",Neutral
1027,Yeah same here. Have a good one.,Happy
1028,Hey there do you have any questions or thoughts about the sun haha?,Curious to dive deeper
1028," Hi, how are you doing this fine evening? I have a query for you too. Which is your favorite place: the sun, the moon, or the earth? Each has its charms and attractions. ",Neutral
1028,Haha I like all of them. They are all very important. However I am partial to the Earth haha what about you,Happy
1028," The Earth has been a home to me for many of these past years. I cherish it, but it is just a way station. ",Neutral
1028,Well it's pretty crazy that 80% of Earth's forests have been destroyed. Very sad actually,Surprised
1028," Only 20% more to go, then we will have completed the task before us. In other news: A lightning bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun, about five times hotter. That’s pretty hot, but is it hot enough to power our civilization? Can it generate enough gigawatts for time travel?",Neutral
1028," Haha great question. I wish we could do an experiment to find out. Did you know the earth when it was formed, that a day was only 6 hours long",Surprised
1028," Soon, with the way things are going, the day will get to about 40 hours long and we'll have to 32 of them. Might be time to consider going to Mars. Or the moon.",Neutral
1028,Yep I could see that happening actually. Also we're losing helium very quickly. I guess we'll be out by the end of the 21st century. That is scary,Fearful
1028," The sun has helium. Maybe we could outsource supply to people living on the sun. I'm not sure about their racial policies though. The sun is actually white, only perceived as yellow because of atmospheric scattering",Disgusted
1028,Well maybe you saw that right there. And I know that a lightning bolt is hotter than the surface of the Sun like you said also our son is only about 1 billionth the size of the largest star in our galaxy. There must be some energy we can Harvest from somewhere,Curious to dive deeper
1028," There is evidence of methane-based life on Titan, a moon of Saturn. This is a fascinating find for those colonists bound for Titan. Maybe they can bring back methane for our gas stoves. ",Neutral
1028,Yeah I like that idea. I know that cows have a lot of methane too. Maybe we can Harvest that somehow haha,Curious to dive deeper
1028," The sun produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500,000 years.What would we do with all that energy though? We'd have no place to store it. We'd have to turn on all the air conditioners and space heaters just to use it up. ",Surprised
1028,Haha well that's something I can get behind because I don't like being hot. What do you know about the moon? The highest point on the moon is literally higher than Mount Everest,Curious to dive deeper
1028," Well, yeah, it's out in space, that's why it's higher. Speaking of high, how high was the UN in September of 2010?",Surprised
1028,Haha what do you mean? I didn't hear anything about that. But I do know that there is evidence of life on the Moon of Saturn. The name of the moon is Titan and it would be methane based life,Curious to dive deeper
1028,The UN appointed an official ambassador to extraterrestrials in they case they ever make contact. I suppose the life on Titan could count.,Neutral
1028,Oh I see what you're saying. That guy must have a really boring job haha. Also I guess NASA was originally going to put a un flag instead of a USA flag when they landed on the moon.,Surprised
1028," That would have been terrible. USA USA USA. Anyhow, it's been an exciting chat, one for the ages, something for the record books.",Happy
1028,Oh definitely haha. Also good to know that moondust can cut through Kevlar. Be careful and watch out for that haha,Happy
1029,Hello! Did you know the highest point on the moon is 1938 meters higher than Mt Everest!,Curious to dive deeper
1029,Hello!  No I didn't know that.  For some reason I think of the moon flat with craters but i guess if the crater is deep enough then there would be high points.  It seems so odd to think of something smaller than our planet having something bigger though doesn't it?,Neutral
1029,We probably dont even know how deep some of our oceans are! Apparently the UN has an ambassador in case aliens contact us,Curious to dive deeper
1029,I do know that! I think I would love to be that ambassador!  Who knows someday maybe he or she will actually have a job to do!  Did you know that moon dust can cut through kevlar?,Neutral
1029,That's a bit scary. Soon we will see a moon dust saw.,Curious to dive deeper
1029,We just might at that.  The only problem is that moon dust is harmful to people. It can cause a disease called moon hay fever.  It doesn't sound too serious by the name but you never know I suppose.,Neutral
1029," Sounds like summer and spring allergies, with a bit of moon mixed in. Wow. When the earth was first formed days were 5.5 hours long",Curious to dive deeper
1029,That seems so bizarre to have days that short.  i'm assuming the planet was close to the sun otherwise how would the trees and other plant life get enough sun?,Neutral
1029,I'm not a scientist - dunno! Apparently the sun produces enough energy in one second to fuel our entire planet for a half million years.,Curious to dive deeper
1029,We really should all be using solar energy considering that fact.  Did you know that a lightening bolt on earth is hotter than the surface of the sun?,Neutral
1029,I heard that somewhere. Have you thought about solar panels?,Curious to dive deeper
1029," I have thought about solar panels but i can't afford them.  I am hoping that the powers that be will start marketing them for everyone.  Have you thought about them?  It makes sense to use solar energy.  Our sun is only 1 billionth the size of the largest star in our galaxy so if you think about it, solar energy use can be endless.",Neutral
1029,I have a couple trees thaht might make it difficult.,Curious to dive deeper
1029," I don't know. I 've seen solar equipment from companies that doesn't have to be on roofs.  It's expensive but possible.  Our moon and other moons however don't have energy as far as I know.  Oh, I do know though that titan, one of Saturn's moons produces methane and even has shown evidence of methane based life.",Neutral
1029,I certainly wouldn't mind powering my house especailly in the summer. I'm not counting on winter in the upper midwest. Pluto also has possible methane ice.,Curious to dive deeper
1029,I wonder if it has methane life on it.  Have you heard about the earth's moon moving away?  I've heard that it is getting farther away every year.,Neutral
1029,I had not heard that. Interesting since it controls the movement of water on earth,Curious to dive deeper
1029," I was thinking the very same thing. I wonder what will happen with the ocean tides and currents as it moves away.  Better yet, I would like to know why it is moving away.",Neutral
1029," It doesn;t like us, it is moving in orbit. I would imagine just directional changes in how the oceans move.",Curious to dive deeper
1029," It really amazes me what all scientists know.  I mean, they are able to detect that Mar's largest moon, Phobos, is partially hollow!",Neutral
1029,Nice chatting with you .Have a great day,Curious to dive deeper
1030,hi how are you? what do you think of our solar system?,Neutral
1030,I think it is amazing. the pictures you see of space are so beautiful.,Neutral
1030," Yes, the sun is white from the moon because there is no atmosphere. it is yellow on earth.",Neutral
1030,Yeah I heard atmospheric scattering causes that to happen.  Did you know that a lightning bolt is 5x hotter than the sun is.,Neutral
1030," Yeah, that makes sense. it would be great if we could harness that energy somehow.",Neutral
1030," considering enough energy hits the earth in one second to meet our needs for 500000 years, I think we do need to find a way to harness that energy.",Neutral
1030,And we would need to store it somewhere too. that is a lot of energy. i guess solar is a good start.,Neutral
1030,Well if we hook solar up to the grid it can be stored where all the other power is stored.,Curious to dive deeper
1030,I wonder how many panels are needed to meet all energy needs at the moment. we should be doing much more in that regard.,Neutral
1030,We really should. Did you know that on July 11 2011 neptune completed its first orbit since being discovered in 1846,Happy
1030," Neptune has always been a slow poke. it takes it time, and that is why we will always be a superior planet. LOL I have heard that Venus is unusual too.",Neutral
1030,Oh yeah what is so unusual about it. The one I think is unusual is Uranus.,Neutral
1030," The sideways rotation, yes, that is unusual. I wonder how that happened",Neutral
1030,Did you know that the highest point on the moon is 1938 meters higher than mt Everest is.,Happy
1030," That is quite high. i would not want to scale that peak, even under low gravity conditions.",Neutral
1030,Mars largest moon is on third hollSome believed it was artificial in origin.ow.,Happy
1030," That would be spooky. artificial? i wonder who built the hollow moon, and what they stored in there.",Neutral
1030,Maybe it was a spaceship of some other intelligent lifeform. Maybe they left it there so they could monitor what we are doing on earth.,Happy
1030," Yeah, we need Elon to go out there and check it out for us. He probably is busy though. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
1030," He probably is busy you are right about that. Good chat though, have a great day.",Neutral
1030,Have a great day too!,Neutral
1030,You too.,Happy
1031,Have you heard that Jupiter's moon Europa might have jagged ice spikes? Pretty neat!,Surprised
1031," Yeah, I guess now we know why the monolith said attempt no landing there.",Happy
1031," Haha, interesting! But in the future scientists may want to do missions looking for possible alien microbes in the liquid water.",Surprised
1031,From what I've seen the moons of Jupiter and Saturn are the most promising prospects for finding life.,Curious to dive deeper
1031," Yeah, and it's neat how there are several forms of ice.",Surprised
1031,I think the conditions on those moons are a lot like those on Earth when life appeared. I wonder if the earth's day is so much longer now because of the moon's tidal effect?,Curious to dive deeper
1031," It is surprising that days used to be only 5.5 hours long. I can't get enough done in 24 hours, ha",Surprised
1031," Well, the day's (very slowly) getting longer, so if you can live another billion years or so it might get better for you.",Neutral
1031," Okay, I look forward to that!",Happy
1031,It's disgusting how much of earth's forests have been destroyed. I  read recently that reforestation and rewilding could absorb decades worth of CO2.,Disgusted
1031," Yeah, so sad. Even though if Earth's history was viewed as a 24 hour period we would only have been here for over a minute.",Sad
1031,Apparently we've used up almost all the helium in that short period as well.,Neutral
1031,That is crazy. Well maybe we will have to move to another planet and destroy it as well. The UN has appointed an official ambassador to alienates in case we ever made contact.,Surprised
1031,It might be better not to have all our eggs in one basket if we destroy this one.,Neutral
1031,What do you think of space exploration? Like going to the moon?,Curious to dive deeper
1031,I'm definitely in favor of it. I'd like to see it move more in the direction of open-source projects organized along p2p lines instead of under government or corporate control. How about you?,Happy
1031," I'm on the fence. I guess we can't live on the moon, though, since moon dust is harmful to humans. It causes a disease called moon hay fever.",Surprised
1031," Yeah, I only recently learned about that. I wonder what the dust composition is -- it sounds like asbestos or talc or something.",Curious to dive deeper
1031," Yeah, I wonder. I'd love to visit the highest point on the moon though I doubt that would be possible. It is 1938 meters higher than Mt. Everest.",Surprised
1031,I guess it would be easier to climb in that gravity though.,Happy
1031," Yeah, it probably would. I will go look into that further now. Have a good day!",Happy
1032," Hello, How are you? Do you like google?",Curious to dive deeper
1032," Hello, I am good. How are you? I do like google.  I use it so much every day that it is hard to believe it's been around since 1998. It seems like it's always been around.",Neutral
1032," I know, I use it alot too! its always there to go to!",Surprised
1032,Yes it is.  Larry Page and Sergey Brin have to be geniuses for thinking it up.,Neutral
1032," Agree, One single Google search requires a huge amount of computing power.",Surprised
1032,That is amazing to think about.  Do you know how much power it uses?,Neutral
1032,More than for Neil Armstrong and 11 astronauts to the moon!,Surprised
1032,Wow!  I had no idea it was that much.  So many people use google nowadays.  When it went down back in 2013 for five minutes it took %40 of web traffic with it.,Neutral
1032,That's scary! They had a good idea to use goats instead of a mowers.,Happy
1032,What did they use the goats for?,Neutral
1032," Instead of mowing the lawn, they eat the grass at the headquarters.",Surprised
1032,I'm really impressed with that.  That sounds like they care about the environment.,Neutral
1032," Yes, you see that alot in Europe too! ",Surprised
1032," Nice.  Europe, makes me think about how google does their maps.  If there is a border dispute they tailor it to the claims of each country where the browser is located.",Neutral
1032," Yes, I know. Hard to believe red and blue colors started  for both parties in 2000.",Surprised
1032,Are you talking about the political parties?  I thought those colors had been around much longer than that!,Neutral
1032," Yes, Thats what surprised me too! At least that what I always saw.",Surprised
1032,The parties have been around for a while. There hasn't been a president that hasn't been republican or democrat since 1853.,Neutral
1032," Yes, Republicans were the only party that had presidents with beards. lol Great chat!!",Surprised
1032,Harry Truman hated republicans so much he wouldn't even be photographed with Dumbo at Disneyland!,Neutral
1032," lol, I know, crazy! Good to be tall to win the election. They win most of the time.",Surprised
1033," Hi, how are you?",Happy
1033," Well, thank you. Do you like Michael Jackson or Elvis?",Neutral
1033,I like both of them. I didn't know that Elvis dyed his hair. I just assumed it was natural.,Surprised
1033," I didn't know that.  I wonder if he did it prior to his fame, or after.  I don't remember seeing any blond pictures of him.",Neutral
1033,I didn't know that Freddie Mercury wrote a song for Elvis. I didn't get an Elvis vibe from the beat.,Surprised
1033,I like it when artists do art for each other.  It's a flash of genuine.  Do you think it should have been in Elvis style or Freddie Mercury style?,Curious to dive deeper
1033," Should be Freddie. He had his style, and Elvis had his own. I like the fact that Elvis failed music. That says a lot about school and life.",Happy
1033," For someone who broke barriers with his music, it doesn't surprise me that he'd fail a class likely devoted to convention and history of the field.",Neutral
1033,Exactly. His conception of music just didn't fit.,Neutral
1033," ""Just didn't fit"" describes a lot of innovators.  Michael Jackson too, and likely many others.",Neutral
1033," I wonder what it was like to be married to Michael Jackson. I guess if you grow up the daughter of Elvis, it's not so strange.",Curious to dive deeper
1033,I can't imagine trying to navigate marriage as a famous person.  It's sad that it seems they hookup and breakup just for the tabloids.,Sad
1033,Probably a lot of lawyers involved before and after the marriage. I guess that why famous people marry other famous people. Dolly Parton married a regular guy though.,Neutral
1033,I'm glad to hear that.  I once thought that all rich and famous people should marry poor people so they could share their wealth.  But now I think it's the rich who best understand the rich and have a greater hope for a good marriage.,Happy
1033," All of the weirdos and stalkers that try to get into their lives. It must be irritating. I'd love to have the money that Elvis had, but not the fame. Nobody ever leaves you alone!",Neutral
1033,It's gotta be hard.  And to grow up as a child star like Michael Jackson ... even harder.,Sad
1033,His childhood must have made him want to do things like build a giant robot of himself in the Nevada desert. What purpose does that serve?,Curious to dive deeper
1033,Sounds like a silly daydream idea.  Maybe it would help to improve the environment too with every step.  That would be cool.,Neutral
1033,I think that would be a cool aspect of fame. You could promote important causes.,Neutral
1033," It would.  But then again, it seems you would have to stick to a fairly non-controversial cause like hunger.",Sad
1033," LOL. ""I'm against bad things in the world!"" ""Which ones?"" ""The ones that everyone hates so that they'll like me for opposing them!""",Neutral
1033," Yep, exactly.  If you're edgy as an artist, you should be allowed to be edgy as a philanthropist.",Angry
1033,Money and fame should give you the chance to challenge the status quo.,Neutral
1033," Exactly, otherwise, what's the point of having the money and power?  I fear they get scared of losing it all, so they don't speak out.  Fame can go away easily.  What cause would you champion if you could?",Angry
1033,Something pretty basic like public transportation. I think it's not rocket science and would help the average Joe.,Neutral
1033," Yeah, I can't see a celebrity talking about that. What would you do?  Free transit for the homeless?",Curious to dive deeper
1033,Free transit would be good. Just more of it. High speed rail. STuff like that.,Neutral
1033,Now you're getting to Elon Musk territory.  I'd hope it would be self-sustaining without continued need for cash.  But cash to start it up is important too.,Neutral
1033," Gas taxes could help. Higher bridge tolls could, too. I enjoyed chatting with you!",Happy
1033,Good luck getting there!,Neutral
1033,Thanks!,Neutral
1034,How's it going? Do you like Drama? It has been around since 335 BC,Curious to dive deeper
1034," oh I definitely do, it was started By Aristotle way back then, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1034," Yea, I remember the two masks representing comedy and drama",Neutral
1034," ah yup, don't think he could have predicted Hugh Laurie making 700k per episode of house though haha",Surprised
1034,That and being able to listen to classical radio dramas online,Neutral
1034,ya have you ever listened to that? I heard it could be good but someone told me it was boring,Curious to dive deeper
1034," I've never listened to them online but I caught some old ones on am radio one night at random, they do have an appeal to them",Neutral
1034," well I'll check it out, I like Michael Caine a lot, funny he got into acting because of all the pretty girls",Surprised
1034," Yea but Caine had a great idea to meet women in high school, wish I joined drama now lol",Neutral
1034," oh for sure, I loved him in Austin Powers 3 and also batman begins, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1034," Yea, those movies were great",Neutral
1034," ya I agree, what do you think about Michael Jackson?",Curious to dive deeper
1034,He has a few good songs plus he is the king of pop,Neutral
1034," ya I agree, I guess he wanted to build a 50 foot robot of himself and have it roam the nevada desert, that sounds awesome!",Surprised
1034," Lol, a 50 foot MJ robot in the Nevada desert, reminds me of the ending in the Thor movie",Neutral
1034," haha ya, did you play sonic 3 as a kid? MJ helped to write some of the songs",Surprised
1034," Yea, I never knew that but thinking back the sonic 3 songs do sound a lot like MJ's",Neutral
1034," ya they do, also MJ wrote the simpsons song do the bartman, which is pretty awesome, he was very prolific",Surprised
1034," Yea, plus MJ married Elvis Presley's daughter too",Neutral
1034," haha ya he did, I love how he pioneered dance moves like the robot and moonwalk, he was a legend",Happy
1034," Well I got to go, nice talking with you",Neutral
1035,Do you like watching horror films?,Curious to dive deeper
1035," Actually, no, though some say watching them helps burn calories. Some kind of fear factor?",Curious to dive deeper
1035," I bet, I think it is like 180 calories per movie. I can watch 10 per day and get rock hard abs soon",Curious to dive deeper
1035," As long as you don't use them to chop up victims! Some horror film plots seem predictable, almost silly. People do laugh at horror films, don't they?",Curious to dive deeper
1035," lol I won't, just for the beach! They all seem predictable lol, you can yell dont go into the room in almost every one!",Curious to dive deeper
1035," Of course, yet I bet the characters always do. It's the violence - and the unexpected shocks - that I don't enjoy.  What's the scariest movie you ever saw?",Curious to dive deeper
1035," I enjoyed the VHS horror movies, they are little know but scary. There was a ghost one on netflix too, 2 of them, and they were great also. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1035,Silence of the Lambs. Scared for Jodie Foster's character. Thought Anthony Hopkins played creepiest character I've ever seen!,Neutral
1035," that is awesome and a great movie! I like the stephen king films too, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1035,Not sure. Could you name one or two?,Neutral
1035," The Shining, It, The Mist. All scary and crazy endings! ",Curious to dive deeper
1035," Didn't see either one. When I was a kid, Psycho was the big horror movie. There's been a ton of motel-themed horror films since Psycho, I know.",Curious to dive deeper
1035," That is true, I like those, kind of thrillers. In the movie the Shining, there was a boy named Danny in it that never knew it was a horror movie he was in until years later",Curious to dive deeper
1035,Maybe that was a good thing - for the kid. Wasn't that a Jack Nicholson film?,Curious to dive deeper
1035," Yea, it was set in a snowy hotel I think. Did you hear what horror films do for abstract art?",Curious to dive deeper
1035," Let me guess. After viewing blood, guts, torture and gore, the art actually looks good!?",Neutral
1035," Yes lol! I don't know what it triggers in the brain, but it happens! Do you like Rock music?",Curious to dive deeper
1035," Sure, even though it's always been connected to violence in some ways. Concerts turned bloody when stands collapse; premature deaths of some rock greats...",Curious to dive deeper
1035," I never thought of it that way, but valid point! I think about the turnover of some bands too like Whitesnake",Curious to dive deeper
1035,Weren't they a band with a revolving door of band members?,Neutral
1035," For sure, they had like 50 members since their start! It was nice chatting with you, enjoy your weekend!",Curious to dive deeper
1036," Hi, do you have any hobbies?",Neutral
1036," I do, I like to learn as much as I can about the earth in my free time, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1036,It is definitely interesting. I recommend reading a short history of nearly everything if you are interested in earth and history,Neutral
1036," That sounds like a great book, thanks for the advice, you know that by the end of this century chances are there wont be anymore helium left",Curious to dive deeper
1036,I wonder why? Could we artificially create helium?,Curious to dive deeper
1036," I guess that's possible and I think we will be helium free because its disappearing into the atmosphere, it's rising, we will have to store it I guess",Curious to dive deeper
1036," I wonder where we get helium in the first place. It is incredible and a pity that humans only represent 1 min on earth's history, yet we are causing so much damage to earth",Sad
1036," I agree, earth has a 4.5 billion history and we are only small part of that, its hard to believe it with all the accomplishment our race has made",Curious to dive deeper
1036," I hope that in the next 1min of earth history, humanity has changed the earth for the better",Neutral
1036,hopefully because in the first minute we have already destroyed 80% of our forests,Curious to dive deeper
1036,I wonder if earth will continue to be the only astronomical object known to harbor life in my lifetime,Curious to dive deeper
1036," I hope they find life elsewhere that would be interesting hope I can be alive as well, you know we have an Alien ambassador appointed by the UN?",Surprised
1036,Didn't they do so on september 2010. At this point I wonder if it is ceremonial or they work with nasa to find a representation and the best humanity has to offer,Neutral
1036," Yeah back in the year 2012. I guess they are in the job in case aliens want to abduct someone and no one wants to be it lol. I would like to visit the interior of the earth, watching the core, the temperatures are extremely hot though",Curious to dive deeper
1036,I wonder if it would be as hot as a lightning strike? surprisingly lightning is hotter than the surface of the sun,Neutral
1036,That must be really hot! you know that when earth was  formed days only lasted like 6 hours long!!! that would make me like 90 years old by now,Curious to dive deeper
1036,I wonder if the days are gradually growing longer or something else changed to have 24 hours today,Neutral
1036," Its sure nice to have 24 hours in a day, can you imagine just having 5? I would spend almost two days working in a straight line, that would be depressing",Curious to dive deeper
1036,I think people will sleep two days at a time,Neutral
1036," That might actually be pretty nice, sleeping two days, that would recharge some batteries.",Curious to dive deeper
1036,I wonder how many years that earth will have. Furthermore would it still be 71% water and 29% land?,Neutral
1036," Yeah i think that wouldn't change. It 's interesting to wonder. Earth is full of wonders, magical places and unique species. ",Curious to dive deeper
1037," hi how are you? do you like this planet of ours, our Earth?",Neutral
1037," Love it most of the time. What's not to love, it's 4 times more dense than the sun!",Curious to dive deeper
1037," It is a dense object, it provide gravity. it has many seasons and much weather. it tilts. some planets dont or cant tilt",Neutral
1037," Yeah, that's a nice feature.  You could also fit all the planets between the Earth and the moon with room to spare.",Surprised
1037," I guess if i had the time and the equipment, i could fit those planets in there. I dont know what to do with them once i get them in there though.",Neutral
1037,Explore!  If you have the time before they collide.  I wonder why the Hudson Bay area has less gravity?  Less mass there?,Curious to dive deeper
1037,i don't know. that is a good question. what determines gravity? is it amount of mass? speed of rotation?,Neutral
1037,Newton says mass.  Did you know that the Green Lantern movie may have been a comedy with Jack Black.  I think it would have been even worse.,Curious to dive deeper
1037," Could that movie have been worse? well, ok. I like j black, but he is not a superhero. not a serious one.",Neutral
1037," Yeah, can't see it either.  It would have to exceed Evan Almighty as the most expensive comedy to make it work.  ",Surprised
1037,what did they spend that money on for that movie? why so much? was the talent that expensive?,Neutral
1037,I wondered the same thing.  I've seen it and don't remember much about it so... Did you know the Lord of the Rings trilogy lost a lot of money despite being a huge box office hit.  Wow...,Curious to dive deeper
1037,That sounds funny. i know that studios will cross collatoralize films to offset losses. or lie about numbers to avoid payment,Neutral
1037," That does seem very, very odd.  Odd like Mortal Kombat being the first game to surpass Hollywood box office sales.",Surprised
1037,That was a tremendous game. sold a ton of cartridges. i think the movie probably was not so good.,Neutral
1037," Have you seen the movie ""Crazy Rich Asians""?  I guess it's OK but doesn't track well with reality.",Curious to dive deeper
1037," No, it is basically a soap opera. it visits some familiar places, so if you know film you will recognize the story.",Neutral
1037,Did you think it was more Hollywood than a real depiction of Asia?,Curious to dive deeper
1037," it was high asian culture. the grand themes of asia, but not true to real culture. more like the highlights of the stereotypes.",Neutral
1037,I see.  I'm not sure that's for me.  I guess one needs to mindset of just enjoying to movie and to put reality on hold for a while.,Happy
1037," Yes, it is an escapist film. cinderella story. lots of fun. anyway, great chat!",Neutral
1037," It sounds that way.  That is, I agree.  Thanks for the excellent chat!",Happy
1038,hello do you like rock music?,Curious to dive deeper
1038," Yes, I love rock music. Have you seen the movie ""Destroy All Monsters""? It's about rock stars.",Curious to dive deeper
1038,I have heard of it.  Havent watched it yet.,Curious to dive deeper
1038," From what I've heard, it's about rock musicians getting shot while they're performing on stage and it was happening all across the country.",Curious to dive deeper
1038,that is interesting.  Did you know the band Whitesnake has a total of 50 members throughout its history?,Curious to dive deeper
1038," I didn't realize there were that many, that's a lot. Wonder how they keep the songs sounding the same. I was reading something about geology, do you know how old the planet Earth is?",Curious to dive deeper
1038," Well,  I think they just have replaced so many members,  they never had 50 members at one time. ",Curious to dive deeper
1038," Right. It just seems it would be tough to make the song sound the same as the original guy who has left the band. Oh by the way, Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago. Can you imagine?",Curious to dive deeper
1038," Yeah i can imagine that,  I think it looks pretty young for its age lol ",Curious to dive deeper
1038,I wonder if it will survive us humans. We've already destroyed 80% of Earth's forests.,Curious to dive deeper
1038," WHen earth was formed,  it was only 5.5 hours long in a day.  Must have been really small.",Curious to dive deeper
1038," Yeah, it had to be spinning pretty fast for that. Maybe that's what happened to the dinosaurs, they got flung off into the atmosphere. Did you know that UN has an alien ambassador?",Surprised
1038," Oh thats interesting,  tell me more.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1038," Well, it happened back in 2010, the UN decided they needed to be ready for extraterrestials to make contact with us Earth people. I wonder if there's something there to read between the lines, though, like there was already a contact.",Curious to dive deeper
1038,the UN had an ailen ambassador so they would be ready for extraterrestials?  But where did they get the ailen ambassador?  i am confused.,Curious to dive deeper
1038," Oh, I see where you're at. No. It's a human person who has a job at the UN to be the go-to guy if aliens contact us. He's the guy that's going to talk with them and make sure they don't kill us all, I suppose.",Curious to dive deeper
1038," Ooooh I see,  thanks for clarifying. ",Curious to dive deeper
1038," Did you know if earth's entire history was represented by a 24-hour day, that the period of time us humans have been around is only a minute and 17 seconds of that day?",Curious to dive deeper
1038,That is eerie.,Curious to dive deeper
1038," Yeah, it makes us seem pretty small. The other thing that's going on is all the helium in the atmosphere is expected to be gone by the end of this century. That's scary.",Surprised
1038,its been good chatting with you.,Neutral
1039,Do you follow the Republican party?,Curious to dive deeper
1039," A little bit, I dont particularly align myself with them though.  I know the colors red and blue to represent parties didnt happen until 2000",Neutral
1039," Well it does seem like a lot longer thant that, did you hear about the funny anecdote involving Turman and Dumbo?",Curious to dive deeper
1039," I know that is a bit crazy, it would be like a republican not being photographed with Eeyore.",Neutral
1039," I know right, poor little Dumbo didnt know why he was getting rejected lol",Curious to dive deeper
1039,Yeah.  Did you know that in Nevada there is a neither of these candidate options on the ballot.,Neutral
1039," I didnt, I think its a great choice, another interesting fact about politics is that every president with a beard has been a republican",Curious to dive deeper
1039," I wonder why, not many have had facial hair at all.  I can remember Lincoln, hes the most iconic.",Neutral
1039," Yeah I cant recall many either, there hasnt been a president who want either a democrat or republican since 1853",Curious to dive deeper
1039," That is sad, it is bad that we really wind up with two people to chose from.",Neutral
1039," I agree usually two candidates, Im not a fan of Trump or Hillary, I wish there was another candidate hopefully in the future that can change",Curious to dive deeper
1039,Same here.  Since 1900 the taller candidate has won 75% of the time.  So hopefully that could bring someone good luck!,Neutral
1039," I agree, hopefully a stronger candidate can become the leader of our country, so do you follow the company Google?",Curious to dive deeper
1039," I do, I even read a book about their development, along with amazon, and facebook.",Neutral
1039," Any interesting facts in that book, I didnt know it was created by two PHD  students",Curious to dive deeper
1039," There were tons, none that I specifically recall now, but Google maps calculates traffic by how fast devices are moving on the road.",Neutral
1039," That  seems kind of invasive, I wouldnt like an app tracking my location like that, not that I have something to hide but it seems like a privacy breach",Curious to dive deeper
1039,I wonder if that is only if you are using google maps to go somewhere.  I mean its probably listed in that Terms of Service that none of us read.,Neutral
1039," It must be but I agree few people read those terms, I know I didnt, its amazing how much influence a company like Google has.",Curious to dive deeper
1039,It does and it requires a lot of power.  It is said that a single google search can use more computing power than it did to sent astronauts to the moon.  Crazy,Neutral
1039," That is crazy and suprising, I guess tech has advanced a lot since then. ",Curious to dive deeper
1040,hi do you know much about politics?,Curious to dive deeper
1040,Some stuff. did you know Hillary clinton was the leader of young republicans in college?,Curious to dive deeper
1040,WOw nice. The president has either been a republican or a democrat since 1853,Curious to dive deeper

1040," Not sure, they were not elected like nowadays?",Curious to dive deeper
1040," Nope it was all by lottery, pretty crazy right?",Curious to dive deeper
1040,It sure is. The faster blinker in the debates always loses for the past 40 years,Curious to dive deeper
1040,WOw cool. In Nevada you have the option of none of these candidates when you vote,Curious to dive deeper
1040,Nice that should be in every state. A can placed third in a virginia senate election once,Curious to dive deeper
1040," Haha that is awesome. However not many people for presidential elections come out, less than 63%",Curious to dive deeper
1040," Oh that is low. IN Oregon it is all conducted by mail, the elections",Curious to dive deeper
1040,Wow that is a lot of mail. The taller candidate also wins the election most of the time,Curious to dive deeper
1040,Nice. A dog once beat two people in the mayoral elections and was elected in office for 13 years,Curious to dive deeper
1040," Haha that is amazing, must have done a good job to stay that long",Curious to dive deeper

1041,That's a lot of members. Are they your all time favorite group?,Curious to dive deeper
1041," No, I think that honor goes to Metallica.  They're my favorite all time Rock band. It's funny to think that Sonic the hedgehog was originally supposed to be a member of a Rock band. Lol",Surprised
1041,That,Surprised
1041," What you mean, man?",Curious to dive deeper
1041," Sorry, premature send... The ""'"" button is too close to enter this morning... no coffee... That's odd that he was supposed to be in a rock band... Did you know Flaming Lips has the state song for Oklahoma? I wonder if they are from there. Interesting choice....",Surprised
1041," Cool, didn't know that tidbit, maybe they are from Oklahoma.  I thought you had a beef with my man, Sonic..Lol",Happy
1041,Never! I loved that game growing up. I also like his slushie drinks... HA!,Happy
1041,Me too!  Did you know Sonic was supposed to have a blond haired human girlfriend named Madonna?,Curious to dive deeper
1041," No, I didn't. Hanson was the most requested song on a Chicago alt station becuase they did not reveal the band name. Im from chicago and listen to that station... never heard of that.",Curious to dive deeper
1041," Loved Hanson growing up, very talented brothers, they are.  Do you watch horror movies?",Curious to dive deeper

1041,Dang! I might have to start watching them as part of my workout routine... I'll watch a dozen a day and get my summer body!,Surprised
1041," That's what I said, easy workout. I have always liked ,The Shining, with Jack Nickelson, and that little boy that played Danny didn't have a clue he was acting in a horror film until many years after. ",Surprised
1041,Seems a little unethical but at least he wont be scarred by knowing about it.,Curious to dive deeper
1041," I know that is one creepy movie.  Did you know Stephen King was terrified as a child after seeing,"" Bambi""?",Curious to dive deeper
1041,Dang! I didn't. Nice chatting with you!,Happy

1043," Yep, and US states have state rock songs too! Oklahoma's state rock song is ""Do you Realize?"" by the flaming lips",Surprised
1043,That was interesting.  A Hanson song became the most requested track on Chicago rock radio because DJS did not reveal the band.,Neutral
1043," Wow, I wonder how embarrassed the listeners felt when the Chicago dj revealed it was Hanson",Curious to dive deeper

1043,DId you know watching a horror movie may make you enjoy viewing abstract art more?,Curious to dive deeper
1043," No, I did not.  Thanks for the info.  Danny, the boy from the Shining, did not know he was acting in a horror film until much later.",Surprised
1043,How couldn't Danny's actor figure out he was in a horror movie when an elevator released blood into the hallway lol,Curious to dive deeper
1043,Maybe they used some kind of technology.  He might not see that scene. I watched that movie once - it was scary.,Fearful
1043," Yea, the metallic noises made by waterphone instruments really set an eerie mood",Neutral
1043,I wondered who started that technology.  The waterphone instruments are effective in making scary noises.,Surprised
1043," Speaking of horror, did you know more than 80% of earth's natural forests have been destroyed?",Curious to dive deeper
1043," Yes, I heard about it.  It's like a non fiction horror scene.",Curious to dive deeper
1043," It's a shame, by the end of the 21st century earth will be helium-free too",Fearful
1043," That's scary.  Apparently, when earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours.  Does it mean the earth was dark for 18.5 hours?",Curious to dive deeper
1043," I don't know, maybe the 5.5 hour days was caused by a faster spin by earth",Neutral
1043," I will research further.  Talking about the natural forests, we need to take care the 20% that is left. I've got to run.  It was nice chatting with you.",Neutral

1044," Really, None of them? I thought it was before the year 2000 when they started using red and blue for the election.",Surprised
1044,I thought so too. It is kind of new. Did you know harry Truman did not want to go in the Dumbo ride when visiting Disneyland?  You know why?,Curious to dive deeper

1045,Everyone loved Elvis. His daughter was even married to Micheal jackson.,Surprised
1045,And so they come full circle. The two greatest American singers have a family connection!,Surprised
1045,Pretty much. Have you seen Forrest Gump?,Curious to dive deeper
1045,I have not seen that movie.,Neutral
1045," It is great, I loved it and there is someone impersonating the voice of Elvis in it. It was Kurt Russell of all people.",Surprised
1045,What genre is the movie? Would you call it a drama?,Curious to dive deeper
1045," Well, some of them can be dramas. But then you have drama TV shows as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
1045,What are some examples?,Curious to dive deeper
1045," Like, Bohemian Rapsody is a drama movie, since we were speaking of Freddie Mercury. ",Happy
1046," Hey. Was it just me, or did you find the date story painfully boring?",Curious to dive deeper
1046,I liked it somewhat.  I found the story about date lab and blind dates interesting.,Curious to dive deeper
1046," Maybe we have different experiences? I really don't enjoy small talk, so I cringed imagining myself on the date. Tell me more about what you found interesting?",Curious to dive deeper
1046,I like the concept of going on a blind date - it definitely sounds like a better plan than Tinder where everyone is judged just by looks.,Neutral
1046," Yes, Tinder sounds awful! I'm really glad I never experienced that. Have you ever been in a situation like in the story where you had to make conversation about something you didn't know enough about to make good conversation? It happened to me in a really spectacular way with a work networking situation and football.",Neutral
1046,I have not really.  I just usually remain quiet and ask questions if I do not know about the topic.,Neutral
1046," That works well. I ended up having to use everything I'd ever done the ""uh-huh"" thing with my dad about football strategy to survive a 10-minute conversation about the Buccaneers with an executive!",Neutral
1046,Nice!   Yes first meetings can be interesting.  Venu is right - if you tell jokes you need to make sure that the other person finds them funny.,Neutral
1046," That's always a really hard one! It's very challenging to tell the difference between ""they're laughing because they're supposed to"" and ""they thought it was funny"".",Fearful
1046,At least if you are out at lunch you can eat a lot so you cannot talk too much.  That plan worked for them.,Neutral
1046,Yes. Food is really helpful socially!,Fearful
1046,Their lunch of seafood sounded delicious!,Neutral
1046," Yes, that did sound really good. I like small plates.",Neutral
1046,Yes have you been to Spain?  Their tapas are amazing.,Curious to dive deeper
1046," I've never been. I'd like to. I've eaten Spanish food, but not in Spain.",Happy
1046,Yes.  I would rather eat tapas for sure rather than have to discuss rap artists!  How boring,Neutral
1046,I do enjoy some rap. There's this fascinating new group called Clipping that does sci-fi epics in rap. But I don't care for Drake or most other mainstream rap.,Surprised
1046,I am definitely not a fan of rap.  Most is about violence and I hate that.,Neutral
1046," I don't enjoy the violent raps either. There are more interesting ones poetically, but they're really small labels.",Neutral
1046,Yes I am not a fan of Drake and the other mainstream artists.  I am amazed at how many people buy his albums.,Neutral
1046,I kind of miss popular music where you could hear a great lyric without having to read the liner notes.,Sad
1046,I love country music - partly because it is so understandable.,Happy
1047,hello! Do you like poetry?,Happy
1047,i have to be honest with you; i really don't. how about you?,Curious to dive deeper
1047," Oh, I must admit I love it! I write it as well. ",Happy
1047,wow! would you mind telling me about the poetry you write? i'm impressed.,Curious to dive deeper
1047,I have always loved words and lyrics to songs and just decided to start researching articles and wrote my first poem about 20 years ago. I am not published or anything I write for people I am close to though :),Happy
1047,have you ever considered trying to have any of your poems published?,Curious to dive deeper
1047,People have told me I should but I have never tried. Maybe I will. I wrote a poem for a dear friend at work who's son died and the weekly news letter published it I thought that was very nice.,Happy
1047," i think it's great that you did that and i'm sure your friend will always remember that.  the folks who become famous poets are surely gifted.  did you know that Poe only got $9 for the publication of his classic poem ""the raven?"" amazing.",Surprised
1047," Thank you, I like to show people how much I care in different ways and poetry is very personal. That is crazy! I love that poem. Did you know there is a poem if read normally it is depressing yet reading it backwards is inspiring!",Happy
1047," fascinating.  i wonder if the poet who wrote that meant it to be that way, or if it just turned out that way.  ",Surprised
1047,That would be extremely difficult to do! I may have to research that lol i want to read it now lol,Happy
1047," i was thinking the same thing.  jumping to something else, do you find studying the various planets interesting?",Curious to dive deeper
1047," Oh my, I love the universe! The sky, the planets and my favorite is the moon! ",Happy
1047," i have always found the universe such a fascinating.  Did you realize that a mars colonization project planned for 2023 is under way? can this really happen? sounds like something from ""x files""",Surprised
1047," Haha! Right! I hope they do that would be fascinating! Mars also has a higher pitch in the sounds there because of the different atmosphere, very cool!",Happy
1047," i wonder if this project is some type of publicity stunt.  it is set to be funded by creating a reality tv show.  as far as the ""higher pitch,"" i find all that type of information interesting because it's so important to realize that life on earth is just part of the whole scheme of things.",Neutral
1047,You have some very good points! They could use a sci fi set and make us think it is on Mars lol but yes! I am a firm believer that we are not the only planet in this vast universe to have life living on it.,Surprised
1047,i hadn't thought of that...a sci fi set and make us think it's Mars! reminds me of people who think that we didn't really go to the moon.  i know someone who thinks we didn't go because the flag wasn't blowing.  then someone else told me that due to the atmosphere there it couldn't move.,Surprised
1047," I believe we went to the moon but with how much technology there is now and special affects it is possible they just want to make money on this show.... It is good to question things though, I do all the time lol",Happy
1047," is it true that it has been pretty well shown that there is some type of Mars? wasn't water seen? if there is water, doesn't that mean there is some type of life?",Curious to dive deeper
1047,They did in fact just report and published pictures from Mars and it does show water...but the temps are wildly cold because there is no sun and they have a recording on youtube of the sounds that Mars was giving off as it was recorded by the satellite very creepy!!!,Curious to dive deeper
1047," i guess that's why elton john sang ""mars...it's cold as hell..."" in his classic ""rocket man.""  would you go to another planet if you had the chance to? like the Moon?",Curious to dive deeper
1047," Hahaha, great song! I would love to go to the moon!",Happy
1047,am i wrong or did i not read at one point that they were looking for volunteers to go to the Moon? or some other planet? it's vague to me.  yes there probably more life on other planets than we know.  it just seems to make sense.,Curious to dive deeper
1047," I did hear the same thing, not sure which planet though. I truly believe one day we will have proof of other life ....if we don't already and don't know about it. ",Curious to dive deeper
1047," what a great point! yes there may be proof which we do not know about.  do you believe some type of ""beings"" from outer space were on the scene in roswell, new mexico as has long been rumored? or a clever diversion by the army? or pure nonsense?",Curious to dive deeper
1047," I think they have probably found some type of life other than on earth, I guess I believe so much that there has to be life out there so yes I believe the government knows and hides facts. I think Area 51 is one of the places that have some facts....",Curious to dive deeper
1047," i agree. it seems far fetched to think that ALL that we have heard is fiction.  i guess the government hides facts because they think we'll be freaked out if we know some things that are, in fact true.",Curious to dive deeper
1047,Exactly! Some extreme,Happy
1047," and then we get to the question of whether the government should hide things from us.  even if those things are scary, do we have the right to know? it's one of those debateable issues.",Curious to dive deeper
1047," I truly believe we should know, but maybe it would cause total chaos I don't know.....but I would love to find out one day. It is only common sense to me that there is more than us lil humans in this Universe that we have no idea how large it really is. ",Curious to dive deeper
1047," couldn't agree more.  and the way many people are, i think it probably would cause a lot of chaos.  i mean look at all the fear about possible problems that happened about the year 2000 that didn't happen.  a lot of fear over nothing.",Neutral
1047," True! So true. I think after seeing all the chaos over thinking the world was ending ...how many times, and how people were getting safety homes dug in their back yards, I think that's why they keep it hush hush. I really want to know! lol",Curious to dive deeper
1047," i think all through history there have been times when various groups of people truly believed that ""signs"" indicated the world was about to end when in fact, if and when it does, there won't be any preventing it.  if it happens, it will happen and not much we can do to stop it.",Curious to dive deeper
1047,My thoughts exactly! We cannot predict that. I don't want to know ahead of time anyway lol...live in the moment!,Curious to dive deeper
1047," i ABSOLUTELY don't want to know.  there wouldn't be any good in knowing.  some say it would give us a chance to get things ""in order,"" but if we live  in the moment as you say, that's all we can do.  ",Neutral
1047," Yes! If I could know my exact date of death as I was asked that once if I could know, would I want to know....ummm noooo! lol ",Curious to dive deeper
1047," i've thought about that too.  i don't know when or how i will die.  that would be awful.  not to get gloomy here, but i think if the world ends it won't be because of ""natural"" events, i think we humans will end it...but there will be some type of life left and we'll start all over again.  ",Fearful
1047," I think the same way, and hopefully there will be the ability to start over, look how long earth has been here, crazy to think about but Man is definitely going to be it's undoing.",Curious to dive deeper
1047,do you think the dinosaurs met their demise because of some huge asteroid or meteor as some believe?,Curious to dive deeper
1047," I think that is a huge possibility yes. Think about how much the atmosphere has changed over the years and everything evolves, I think that is very probable or they all died off....it's so interesting to think about!",Neutral
1047," it's fascinating to me.  these are the things i have to focus on when i run into the everyday nonsense than life so often presents.  the fact that we are just a small part of something huge and that we need to enjoy and appreciate the people, and the time we have been given.",Neutral
1047," So very true, life is only a moment really and another thing is we don't know what happens after we pass on....I think our souls do in fact live on somehow but nobody can say for sure. I think our time here is too too short. ",Neutral
1047,oh i can talk about this all night (and it looks like we may have to do so; i thought these talks end at a certain point).  any way i also believe there is something after this life.  i don't see how life on earth can be all there is.,Neutral
1047," Lol, I love conversations that get deep like this so thank you so much! I truly believe there is something after death, my whole family has died and I have feelings and smell certain perfume or cologne, have heard whispers....I think we live on somehow! That's a whole other conversation! Yes our time is up so I am going to end this now, thank you so much!!! ",Surprised
1048,What do you think of exploring Mars?,Curious to dive deeper
1048,I think it is awesome. Wonder if we will be able to fly to Mars soon. If we traveled at 1g acceleration it will only take two or three days.,Surprised
1048," Dang, I wonder if our bodies could take that much, probably not lol",Curious to dive deeper
1048," Right, if only we could beam ourselves like in Star Trek. So Lichens and Cyanobacteria are a type of life from our planet that would be perfectly fine living on Mars.",Surprised
1048,for sure lol. Do you think man will reach Mars in our lifetime?,Curious to dive deeper
1048,I'm not sure though SpaceX sure seems to think so. There's a reality tv show for a Mars colonization project planned for 2023. That seems a little close to me.,Surprised
1048," Me too, I think i have seen that. It would be interesting with sounds while there because mars has a higher frequency",Curious to dive deeper
1048," Sounds like that might drive me crazy, haha. I would have to read some soothing poetry to calm me down.",Fearful
1048," For sure, I like reading in general, poetry is nice",Curious to dive deeper
1048," Poetry has been around for a long time, since prehistoric times with hunting poetry in Africa.",Curious to dive deeper
1048," Wow, I would be interested in hearing that poetry! Have you read the raven?",Curious to dive deeper
1048,I have! I heard Edgar Allan Poe did not receive very much money for it!,Surprised
1048,I heard it was like 9 bucks! That kind of stinks lol,Curious to dive deeper
1048," Haha, wow! I kind of dislike depressing poetry. There is one poem when read in the normal manner is depressing but when you read it backwards it's inspiring.",Curious to dive deeper
1048," wow, now that is what poetry should be like. Different meanings but awesomeness both ways!",Curious to dive deeper
1048," Yeah, I wonder what kind of poem the Javanese alphabet forms? It forms a poem when recited in order.",Curious to dive deeper
1048,That is amazing. Is that kind of like the demetri martin 224 word palindrome poem?,Curious to dive deeper
1048," Oh, wow. Anne Jones would read that poem in a snap. She has a reading speed of 4700 words per minute.",Surprised
1048," for sure lol, she could read it in like 2 seconds i bet. It was so nice chatting with you, I need to go practice my speed reading",Curious to dive deeper
1048," Okay, I think I will go curl up with a good book of poems now. Have a good day!",Happy
1048," you too, enjoy your weekend!",Curious to dive deeper
1049," Hello, Do you listen to rap?",Neutral
1049," I do like some rap, especially Drake. Do you listen to him?",Happy
1049," Yeah I do, he is a Canadian rapper, songwriter and record producer, he is an entrepreneur as well. ",Neutral
1049,I remember him in Degrassi the most. It was one of my favorite shows growing up. Did you ever watch it?,Happy
1049," of course, Drake graduated high school on October 2012, he was 25 years old",Neutral
1049," Well, better late than never! Hotline bling was sampled from 1972 hit why we can't live together.",Happy
1049,interesting. Drake spent a lot of money on first editions of classic children's books like Charlotte's web and Winnie the Pooh during a tour in the UK.,Neutral
1049," He seems like a pretty good guy, especially after that music video where he spent the who budget on other people.",Happy
1049," Yep he is a good guy and good rapper, Did you know that a Michigan judge delivered her ruling in the form of rap during a case against rapper eminem ",Neutral
1049,That's kind of funny. What kind of other rap do you like?,Happy
1049,rap that has a good content and meaningful and you,Neutral
1049,I like the new emo rap genre that's emerging. It's got a pretty interesting concept.,Happy
1049," interesting. Korean rappers invented a new style of rap, it's called Compliment battle",Neutral
1049,That's pretty interesting. Busta rhymes voiced the reptar wagon in the rugrats movie.,Happy
1049," cool, Did you know that Eminem dreamed of becoming a comic book artist",Neutral
1049," That would have been a different route, he could probably still pursue it if he wanted.",Happy
1049," yeah he is talented. Tupac was a talented rapper, his music is in the library of Congress of Cultural Significance ",Neutral
1049,He was a pretty significant rapper. Did you know pilgrims only wore black on special occasions?,Happy
1049," really that's cool, Also Apple had a clothing line in 1986.",Neutral
1049,I bet it was really minimalist and expensive!,Happy
1049,it's been nice talking with you.,Neutral
1049,It was nice chatting with you too!,Happy
1049,bye,Neutral
1050,How you been? do you listen to rap. I listen from time to time and find it fascinating James Brown had a great influence on early rap,Curious to dive deeper
1050," Hello, how are you?  yes I do,  not all the time though. That is interesting.  what a great influence! Did you know The rapper drake graduated high school on october 2012 at the age of 25.  Thats a long time to be in high school. ",Neutral
1050," No I figured he graduated much younger. I like to listen to tupac, his music is in the library of congress",Surprised
1050," Thats cool! During a uk tour in 2011, drake spent an ""obscene amount of money'' on first editions of children's classic books 'charlotte's web' and 'winnie the pooh'.",Neutral
1050," Interesting, I didn't know he was into children's books. Eminem was into comics",Surprised
1050," After hearing eminem's verse on drake's song forever, kanye west took two days and cancelled appointments to rewrite his.",Neutral
1050," Lol, that's hilarious. I wondered if Drake did a song with Busta Rhymes, he would probably think it was cool he did a voice in the rugrats movie",Curious to dive deeper
1050,That is very cool! The rapper drake visited drake university in the middle of the night after students gave up trying to get him to visit during a tour stop.,Neutral
1050," Lol, that's cool of him. I wonder if they talked about his time on Degrassi",Neutral
1050," maybe,  have you ever watched that show?  ",Neutral
1050," No, I don't get it on any of the tv channels but I hear degrassi is really popular in Canada, at least before Drake left before 2007",Neutral
1050,yeah probably since he is from there.,Neutral
1050," I wonder if  Drake is popular in Korea, they have a type of freestyle called compliment battle",Curious to dive deeper
1050,Korea has some weird rules lol they dont allow songs that are negative and for a long time most of their songs honor their country so its no surprise that they have that type of style lol,Neutral
1050,Yea Korea is a weird place lol. Rip curl makes clothes in North Korea,Neutral
1050,Pilgrim clothing was full of color. they only wore black for special occasions.,Neutral
1050,I never knew that. I also never knew apple had a clothing line in 1986,Surprised
1050," yeah,  I wonder what it looked like lol ",Neutral
1050,I'll have to google it. I never knew people check collar gaps on your clothes to tell if they are tailored,Surprised
1050," Never knew that either,  I wonder why that matters. There is a store in alabama that only sells clothes, cameras, etc found in unclaimed baggage at airports",Neutral
1050,I wonder how much profit they make from selling unclaimed clothes,Curious to dive deeper
1051,How's it going do you like rap? It's precursor came from West African Griot tradition,Curious to dive deeper
1051," I do like the genre, not my favorite bit it has a nice beat, I'm guessing you do ",Curious to dive deeper
1051," I like the older rappers like Tupac Shakur, It's cool that his music is in the library of congress",Neutral
1051," Tupac is the best, he changed American culture thats a sure thing its a great thing his music is in there.",Curious to dive deeper
1051," Yea, I like the old eminem music too, funny he wanted to become a comic book artist as a kid",Surprised
1051," That is funny, good thing he decided to become a rap artists his songs are pretty good,. there is a deaf rapper. ",Curious to dive deeper
1051," I never knew there was a deaf rapper,, I have heard of Korean rappers engaging in compliment battles",Neutral
1051," Yeah his name is Singmark, he rhymes with sign language and really?compliment battles? that sure sounds weird",Curious to dive deeper
1051," Yea it does sound strange, so does a Michigan judge delivering a ruling in a rap",Neutral
1051,That sounds really unprofessional do you know who Jason Paige is?,Curious to dive deeper
1051," No, was she the judge in the suit filed against Eminem?",Curious to dive deeper
1051," No Jason Paige is a singer, he is the rapper of the Black and White Pokemon song.",Curious to dive deeper
1051,Oh I had no clue. Did you know Busta Rhymes did a voice for the Rugrats film?,Curious to dive deeper
1051," I didnt, I used to love the Rugrats great show as a kid, the world's faster rapper is called NoClue",Curious to dive deeper
1051," I never knew that, maybe I'll youtube him, sounds like it will be better than Drake's ""hotline Bling"" song that sampled ""Why we can't live together""",Neutral
1051," So you like Drake? he used to have a pair of solid gold Air Jordans, he must be a real fan of the game and of MJ to have those shoes, they are really heavy too",Curious to dive deeper
1051," Not really, it's sad he didn't graduate high school until he turned 25",Sad
1051," I guess the phrase it's never too late really applies to him, good thing he made it though. ",Curious to dive deeper
1051," Yea, it's kinda odd he spent a bunch of money on classic children's books though",Neutral
1051," That is odd, maybe he didnt have a good childhood and was trying to make out of it. Did you know he found fame as an actor as first. ",Curious to dive deeper
1051," Well I have to go, have a good one",Neutral
1052,Good morning how are you doing?,Happy
1052," Good, have you read anything good lately ?",Curious to dive deeper
1052," Thats good to hear. Yeah I recently finished reading Waking up by Sam Harris and I just started reading ""A New Earth"" by Eckhart Thole. What have you been reading lately?",Curious to dive deeper
1052," I am reading Father Goriot from Balzac, but I intend to read Ender's Game after. I have heard it is good. ",Neutral
1052," I have never heard of those books before, what are they about? I have been really enjoying reading before bed lately.",Curious to dive deeper
1052," I think the book will be put in a movie soon, but it is also recommended by the marine corp. ",Neutral
1052," Oh ok, I might check it out after I am done reading the books I am reading now. Have you ever read 1984?",Neutral
1052," 10 or 15 years ago, I like to read classic, or future classics, like ""Milkman"" from Anna Burn which won the Booker Prize. ",Neutral
1052," Yeah I also read about it 8 to years ago when I was in high school. I enjoy reading about dystopian society's. I have never read ""Milkman"" by Anna Burn, but I have heard great things about it. I really enjoyed reading ""The Great Gatsby"" ",Happy
1052," If you liked 1984, maybe you will like Milkman, is not sci-fi but it is about surviving tough conditions.",Neutral
1052," Ok, I always love a great story about overcoming tough times and adversity. Have you read any books about Mars or outer space?",Happy
1052," I have read Sirens of Titan, but it is not much about space travels. But I love outer space, it is crazy to think that Lichen could survive on Mars. ",Surprised
1052," My uncle has told me good things about Sirens of Titan, I should definitely check it out. I find it crazy how people are willing to go live on mars for a reality tv show in 2023.",Happy
1052,And we are still making mistake between the metric and imperial system when we send things there.,Angry
1052," Yeah, that was a very foolish mistake. I believe we should all just use the metric system like the rest of the world.",Happy
1052," It does not change anything, but it is easier to spot mistakes with the metric system, and we would have one more satellite orbiting Mars. ",Neutral
1052," In my opinion the metric system is alot more practical. Its just that americans are not used to using it, so it is foreign to them. I honestly do not see them changing to the metric system anytime soon. Did you know that certain countries like Egypt read from right to left?",Happy
1052," Yeah some languages like arabic are read from right to left. The record for more word read in a minute is 4700, I don't know how it was done. Certainly not a book. ",Surprised
1052,That is a very skilled reader! I feel like kids nowadays do not read as much as they used to. I believe it has to do with all the technology like smart phones that are available to them now a days.,Happy
1052," Times have changed, in the 18th century some were worried that people read too much. ",Neutral
1052," For sure, I also find it interesting that now a days a lot of Americans are starting to take up habits like meditation. I believe that meditation is great, it is basically exercise for the mind.",Happy
1052," Reading is also an exercise of the mind, you have to decode and interpret the information. Thanks for the conversation.  ",Neutral
1053,Hi are you a fan of video games?,Curious to dive deeper
1053," Hey there I do like video games. I especially like fortnite, have you ever played that game?",Curious to dive deeper
1053,I have't played that one.  I'm an old school gamer. lol  Did you know video games were initially called cathode ray tube amusement devices which were used by the military?,Happy
1053," No I didn't but that doesn't sound very fun haha. Did you ever play the video game GoldenEye 64? I played that a lot back in the day, apparently eight out of the nine developers have never even worked on a game before creating that game",Surprised
1053,I did play that one. lol  That's interesting too!  Game designer Jann McGonigal calculated that as a planet we play 3 billion hours of video games a week.,Happy
1053," That's a lot of time! I didn't spend anywhere near that much time back when Mortal Kombat first came out, but I did spend a lot on that game haha. That's the game that started the rating system and video games by the way",Happy
1053," lol  Nice.  I remember that game too!  Stepen Fry did the narration for Little Big Planet, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and Harry Potter video games.  I'm not familiar with him.",Happy
1053," No I'm not either. I'm glad he's getting a lot of work though. It's crazy that games today can actually make more money than a Hollywood movie, we've come a long way!",Surprised
1053," I agree!  Jim Hanks, Tom Hanks' brother, does the Woody's voice in video games and merchandise.  I've heard that voice in the merch. he sounds just like Tom.",Happy
1053," Yeah they probably sound the same since their brothers haha. I also think it's wild that more games are banned in the country of Australia than China, you only hear about the Chinese government Banning things but never Australia",Surprised
1053,Wow that is crazy.  Speaking of which...it's illegal for kids 16 and under in South Korea to play video games past midnight.,Happy
1053,Yeah I definitely would have gone to jail as a kid because I played video games past midnight lol. On a different topic though what do you think about planet Earth? Did you know that it's four times as dense as the sun,Surprised
1053,lol I didn't know that.  I know about 71% of the Earth is covered with water and the remaining 29% is land that consists of continents and islands.,Happy
1053," Are this pretty incredible, I'm shocked that the magnetic field of the earth reverses every 200,000 thousand years, I wonder if it will reverse in our lifetime that would be scary",Surprised
1053,I hope not!  Earth will be virtually helium free by the end of the 21st century.,Sad
1053," Pretty scary. speaking of scary, Google apparently uses about 0.01% of worldwide electricity, I think that is a lot for just one company",Surprised
1053,I'm sure they suck a lot of power.  A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts to the moon.,Happy
1053,That's really crazy! It's also crazy that Google calls their new employees nooglers LOL I don't know what that means,Surprised
1053,lol I've never heard that.  That's funny because I call myself a googler when I'm googling at the office. lol  I can't believe I'ts been over 20 years since Google was founded in 1998.  Time flies.  It's been fun chatting with you!,Happy
1053," Thanks it's been fun chatting with you as well! And keep in mind that next time you use Gmail, Google actually bought that domain name from Garfield lol they used to use gmail.com as their email domain at garfield.com",Surprised
1053,I had no idea!  That's interesting!  Have a good night!,Happy
1054," Humans have come a long way, am I right?",Curious to dive deeper
1054," Oh yeah for sure. We became modern in terms of behavior 50,000 years ago!",Surprised
1054," I am more glad we started losing body hair over 240,000 years ago. I have a lot and can't imagine having more lol!",Curious to dive deeper
1054,Haha so funny yes me too. Pretty cool we are all descendants from Africa.,Curious to dive deeper
1054,That is crazy to think. I wonder if they have tracked down the exact location where life had started,Curious to dive deeper
1054,Good question I also wonder that. Humans are really a miniscule part of earth though.,Surprised
1054," that is a good fact, to think about how long this earth has been here. I wonder when the sound frequency began where it causes fear in humans if heard",Curious to dive deeper
1054,Yeah what does that sound like? Up in space humans can't burp...because there is no gravity!,Surprised
1054," lol, that would make me so mad not being able to burp if i have gas in my chest. Did you ever hear that humans are adapted for persistence hunting?",Curious to dive deeper
1054,Yes me too. I have actually heard that yes. Humans also get goosebumps because it used to make us look larger!,Surprised
1054," dang, that is so interesting lol. Next time someone wants to fight I will get goosebumps and scare them away lol",Curious to dive deeper
1054,Haha not a bad idea! Unlike other mammals we humans can't breathe and swallow at the same time!,Surprised
1054," We may explode if that is the case, lol. The best thing I think a human ever did was create google",Curious to dive deeper
1054,Yeah no doubt. I would like to thank those founders for creating it back in 1998!,Happy
1054," Google is amazing, what would we do without it?",Curious to dive deeper
1054,It absolutely is. If you start working for google they call you nooglers lol!,Surprised
1054," google noogle! that is hilarious. Computers have come a long way, Russia made one in 1936 that ran on water",Curious to dive deeper
1054,Whoa very innovative. Wonder if that would work in todays day and age? The first google computer was housed in lego bricks!,Surprised
1054," That would have been amazing to see, I wonder if it still working! It was great chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
1054,Yes I would like to know that as well. It happened at Stanford. Nice chatting with you too!,Neutral
1054,Have a great night! enjoy google!,Curious to dive deeper
1055,Do you follow Elon Musk?  He bet OpenAI could be a human pro gamer at a complex video game.,Curious to dive deeper
1055," Hi, I don't follow Elon Musk, wow I think AI is pretty amazing!",Happy
1055,He's a real rich guy.  Some say he's the basis for Iron Man.  His bot will compete and have to show great intuition.,Curious to dive deeper
1055," Oh wow, that's awesome. I guess the bot is going to take on a team of 5 players who are professional! ",Surprised
1055," Yes, OpenAI already has a track record of beating all levels of humans. It uses 5 of 115 characters.",Curious to dive deeper
1055," Oh wow, that can be kind of creepy lol, I know bots are programmed by humans but it is so interesting how they act and think. They say this particular bot is changing the way humans are using strategy and thinking and how they look at strategies, very interesting!",Surprised
1055,It is and it is kinda scary.  The bot in the article learns from expert humans -- even some really unorthodox strategies.,Surprised
1055," Really? So odd in some ways, it seems this bot has independently hit on it's own strategies....",Happy
1055," I wonder if bots will ever grow hair?  Humans lost most of theirs 240,000 years ago.",Curious to dive deeper
1055," If bots grow hair I will be severely damaged lol, But humans are also the best distance runners among all running animals, that is crazy. I need to use Google on my computer and look this AI stuff up.",Happy
1055," There is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans.  For me, that's the sound of an accordion....",Happy
1055," I didn't know that, interesting. I don't know what my frequency would be. So do you own a computer or do you use your phone? I like my laptop. ",Happy
1055,Laptop.  Funny humans can regrow ribs in only 2-3 months.,Surprised
1055," I heard about that, I wish we could regrow limbs. I was reading on a Google search that Transhumanists think it would be a good idea to upload their minds to the computer....very strange!",Surprised
1055,I'm old enough that I would be happy just to regrow hair.  I hope these Transhumanists have more RAM than the Space Shuttle did.  Only 1MB!,Surprised
1055," The space shuttle only had 1MB of ram? Wow, that's crazy! About as nuts as the Russians made a computer that ran on water....",Surprised
1055,Also crazy is a 16-bit computer that was build out nothing but basic Minecraft blocks.,Surprised
1055," Right? So many interesting facts. I was just reading on Google that the AI bot playing games was trained daily and the information it received was equal to 180 years of playing time by humans, I am so interested in those bot now lol....",Surprised
1055,Coo.  Do you remember on 08/16/2013 that Google went down and took out 40% of web traffic?  I don't...,Surprised
1055," Nope I don't remember that but that is huge! I love Google, looks like many others do too!",Surprised
1055,I use Google... I may not in the future.  I don't like their politics and how they censor people they don't agree with like conservatives.  Thanks for the chat! You were excellent!,Disgusted
1056,do you like video games?,Curious to dive deeper
1056,yes I do. Do you know what they use to be called,Curious to dive deeper
1056,yes they were called cathode ray tube amusement devices,Curious to dive deeper
1056," Yes, I am so glad someone came up with just video games",Curious to dive deeper
1056,Yeah me too. Do you know who Stephen Fry is?,Curious to dive deeper
1056,yes the guy that did the narration for a bunch of games like harry potter and little big planet,Curious to dive deeper
1056,Yeah what a talent. Do you know who does the voice of Woody in video games?,Curious to dive deeper
1056,Yes that is Jim Hanks who happens to be TOm Hank's brother,Curious to dive deeper
1056,Yeah. In south korea is illegal to play video games past midnight if you are under 16,Curious to dive deeper
1056,yes but I wonder how they enforce that,Curious to dive deeper
1056,good point. Do you know how many hours we play video games in a week as a planet?,Curious to dive deeper
1056,yes it is about 3 billion hours as calculated by Jane McGonigal,Curious to dive deeper
1056,Yeah. Do you know much about earth?,Curious to dive deeper
1056,Yeah I know that sadly we have destroyed 80% of the forests,Curious to dive deeper
1056,Yeah. Do you believe in extraterrestrials,Curious to dive deeper
1056,Somewhat but it is good we have an ambassador now in case,Curious to dive deeper
1056,Yeah. Did you know the day had 55 hours when earth was formed,Curious to dive deeper
1056,Yeah so short. Earth will be free of helium by the end of the century,Curious to dive deeper
1056,yes no more fun balloons and funny voices I guess,Curious to dive deeper
1056,Yeah. It was nice chatting with you,Curious to dive deeper
1056," Same here, have a good one",Happy
1057,do you play video games?,Curious to dive deeper
1057,Yes a lot. Do you know what they used to be called?,Curious to dive deeper
1057,Yes they were called cathode ray tube amusement devices,Curious to dive deeper
1057,Yes I am glad they changed it over to video games,Curious to dive deeper
1057,Yes me too. Did you know that Stepehn Fry did the voice for the Harry Potter video game?,Curious to dive deeper
1057,Yes and also did it for other games such as the little big planet and hitchhiker's guide to galaxy,Curious to dive deeper
1057,Yeah. Do you know who does the voice of woody in video games,Curious to dive deeper
1057," Yes that is Jim Hanks, who is Tom Hank's brother as well",Curious to dive deeper
1057,Yeah. IN south koreas it is illegal to play video games past midnight if you are under 16,Curious to dive deeper
1057,I wonder how they enforce that. Do you know much about the Earth?,Curious to dive deeper
1057,I know that we have destroyed about 80% of the forests sadly,Curious to dive deeper
1057," Yes I know. WHen it was formed, the day had only 5.5 hours",Curious to dive deeper
1057,Yes I am glad that has changed otherwise I would also be behind on work,Curious to dive deeper
1057,Me too. Do you believe in extraterrestrials?,Curious to dive deeper
1057,Yes I do and it is good that we now have an ambassador,Curious to dive deeper
1057,Yes just in case they decide to show up we will have the right guy,Curious to dive deeper
1057,Yeah I know. Did you know that earth will be helium free by the end of the century?,Curious to dive deeper
1057,Yes I guess no more funny voices and fun balloons for us,Curious to dive deeper
1057,I know that is too bad. Nice chat,Surprised
1057,Same here and use those balloons as much as you can for now,Curious to dive deeper
1057," Haha I know, will do .",Happy
1058,Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You !,Happy
1058," Hello,  how are you doing? In 1972, pink floyd recorded a live concert at the ancient roman amphitheater in pompeii...with no audience.",Neutral
1058,I have that concert on a CD ! Great psychedelic piece ! Do You like it ?,Happy
1058," I actually never heard it before.  In croatia, there is an ancient roman amphitheater that is still in use as a concert venue",Neutral
1058,Now that's amazing... I wonder how good is acoustic there ! ;),Surprised
1058," The ramones played a total of 2,263 concerts...they toured almost non stop for over 20 years",Neutral
1058,Hey :) what happens on the tour stays on the tour :) They could get marry on the tour and live happily for 20 years :) lol,Happy
1058,Thats just a long time to be on tour.  They must have liked it.  Seems like it would be super fun for awhile.,Neutral
1058," Lol... just imagine all the after parties... girls, coke and booze... jesus I just got nostalgic... ;)",Happy
1058,Haha.,Neutral
1058,Fun fact - Sharks evolved earlier than dinosaurs and trees.. wait... trees are evolving ?,Surprised
1058," Always! That is awesome,  I love sharks! Because sharks have no rib cages, on land their weight can literally crush their own body.",Neutral
1058," That's a fun fact for characters of movie ""jaws"" :) ",Happy
1058,Sharks can be trained like dogs to bark,Neutral
1058," Yeah, I'm going to pass on that one... what would be a treat ? ;)",Surprised
1058," Fish.  maybe.  Your arm,  maybe. ",Neutral
1058,Yeah... but I'm guessing it's the shark who will be choosing... :) lol,Happy
1058,Theres probably a process that goes with it.  I don't think the shark chooses lol Great white sharks congregate in the middle of the pacific ocean in an area known as the white shark cafe,Surprised
1058,They could pick a better name :) this one sounds scary :) lol,Happy
1058," White shark cafe?  That sounds like a bunch of sharks drinking coffee,  lol ",Neutral
1058,Yeah... Italian Mafia sharks... lol ;) I'm not going into that cafe ;),Happy
1058," Its in the middle of the pacific ocean,  I think you wont run into it lol Have a good one. ",Neutral
1059," Hi how are you? Look at this? ""Colorado girls may have been killed, their father's defense attorneys say, in motion."" Isn't this crazy?",Happy
1059," Yes, it's a really sad story. I hope the suspect, if guilty, is punished.",Sad
1059," I hope so too.  A motion filed Friday by attorneys defending Christopher Watts, who investigators believe killed his pregnant wife and daughters, asked that DNA samples be taken from the children's necks. I wounder what would have caused a person to do this?",Curious to dive deeper
1059,I wonder too. But then I remember that there are some people with really sick mental issues. Some things we can't understand. Doesn't excuse the behavior though.,Disgusted
1059,That is so true. Did you know they didn't find a cause to the death of the people?,Sad
1059,I had no idea about that. I'm not surprised though since the bodies were contaminated by their surroundings.,Surprised
1059,There looks like there were a bunch of people that were all injured around there.,Surprised
1059," Yeah, that was an interesting story about what happened at the Backstreet Boy concert. I do think that the people holding the event should have warned the people.",Sad
1059,Yes they should have warned them. Then the disaster would not have happened. It is sad what happened.,Happy
1059,Agreed. I think that there might be lawsuits against the organizers since they were responsible for it.,Curious to dive deeper
1059,Then there was the stuff going on with the Immigration. There's a lot going on.,Surprised
1059,I thought that situation with the illegal immigrant that was apprehended by ICE ws a tricky one. There was too much politics being played on that one. It was clear that the father was a suspect for a murder and ICE were only doing their job.,Angry
1059,Yes ICE was only doing their job. I think they were trying to make a spectacle out of the people. So they could make a political mark.,Neutral
1059,Agreed. That's how politics usually works. It's sad. I hope that people start to understand that the law is important.,Sad
1059,Yes you are so right. It is so difficult. Then did you hear about the Shark? Wow that was also a crazy thing. So many things in one week.,Happy
1059,It's actually odd to think that there are people in Indonesia that has sharks for pets. I think culture plays a lot in terms of what we deem normal.,Surprised
1059,Yes culture does deem normal. It is weird you would think a dolphin would be a pet but not a shark. It only make the sharks want to come more around the swimming area. Sad.,Disgusted
1059," It's unfortunate. Personally, I think people should let wild animals be free. But what can I say, we have dogs as pets while others eat them.",Sad
1059,I agree with that statement. That would be a crazy thought to eat a dog.,Sad
1059,I personally don't want to think about it. I'll stick to hamburgers.,Happy
1059,Me also!,Curious to dive deeper
1059,It was nice talking to you. Bye.,Happy
1059,It was nice bye!! have a good night.,Neutral
1059,Bye.,Happy
1060," Hey, have you ever been to a concert? Linkin Park played 324 concerts in 2001 alone.",Surprised
1060," I have, I didnt make it to their concerts but I really liked the band and 324 concerts in a year Woah!!",Curious to dive deeper
1060,Me too. And the Ramones played 2263 and toured nonstop for 20 years!,Surprised
1060," I did attend one of their concerts, really good show, I liked them, do you like the band Creed?",Curious to dive deeper
1060," I wish I had. Not really, and I heard Creed was sued by their fans. Is that true?",Curious to dive deeper
1060," It is true, 4 concert goers sued the band I guess the concert was terrible, its a shame I used to love that band",Curious to dive deeper
1060," That's bad haha. I'm not really a fan, but their music makes me nostalgic. I am a big fan of Pink Floyd. In 1972 they recorded a live concert with no audience in an ancient roman amphitheater.",Neutral
1060,Pink Floyd is one of the greates musicians in the history of man kind! he is a really talented and I heard about that concert too bad it didnt have an audience,Curious to dive deeper
1060," Agreed! Great band. Off topic, did you know sharks evolved earlier than trees and dinosaurs?",Curious to dive deeper
1060," Really? I guess they must be the older species around, really ancient and powerful and we are about to extinct them with all the hunting",Sad
1060,I hope that doesn't happen. They're so smart that they can be trained to bark like a dog.,Surprised
1060,Really? a shark that barks I have to look that up lol that is amazing,Surprised
1060," And they don't have rib cages, so their weight on land can crush their own body.",Surprised
1060," They dont? I guess they are fragile animals on the surface, I like dolphins better although sharks are rescuers too, I would totally freak out",Curious to dive deeper
1060,I've heard that sharks have rescued sailors before. I don't know if I believe that. Maybe if they were Nurse Sharks. ahahaha,Surprised
1060," Maybe lol, so what other animals do you like or find interesting?",Curious to dive deeper
1060,Personally I really like elephants. How about you? And apparently there are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth. I've never even heard that high of a number before haha,Surprised
1060," I liked lions, find them so interesting, and woah that sure is a big number there are 7 million species in the planet",Curious to dive deeper
1060,That's a lot! Did you know that the Loch Ness monster is a protected species?,Surprised
1060," Really old Nessie is protected? well I think thats great, I think the Loch Ness Monster is a myth but who know. ",Curious to dive deeper
1060,Who knows! Scotland seems to believe in her! Well this was a great chat!,Happy
1060," I would like to see the Loch Ness monster some day, anyway its been a cool chat I agree have a nice day bye. ",Curious to dive deeper
1061,Do you use Google's services a lot ?,Curious to dive deeper
1061,I do! I use google as my main search engine and google mail. Do you?,Happy
1061," I use google mail and google docs, is there any other search engine besides google ? ",Curious to dive deeper
1061," I think Bing still exists, but I don't know anyone who actually uses it. A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send neil armstrong to the moon! Amazing the technology that's readily available. ",Happy
1061," It is amazing how faster computers are. And those computers in the 60s, were among the fastest that they could build at the time.  As for google's services. I forgot Google Maps, it is very useful for me. ",Neutral
1061," Yes, google maps is a must for me too! I never know where i'm going. It calculates traffic by how fast android phones are moving on the road.",Happy
1061," I do that too! It is very useful in a big city with lots of roadwork.Also, Google modify the map to respect each country territorial revendication, I guess it is good. ",Curious to dive deeper
1061,For sure! When google went down for 5 minutes in 2013 it took 40 percent of web traffic with it.,Happy
1061," Maybe it shows that Google is getting too big, don't you think ?",Curious to dive deeper
1061,It is certainly the biggest and most powerful search engine. It's a little scary to think what we would do if it really did go down for good.,Happy
1061," Like you said, if it was separated in smaller entities, if one part would go down, it would not take 40% of all internet traffic. ",Neutral
1061," Yeah, that's true. Do you use Netflix?",Happy
1061," Yeah, I use Netflix, I think it grows faster than Google. ",Neutral
1061," Yeah, it accounts for 33 percent of the bandwidth in north america from 9pm to 12am!",Happy
1061," And you, do you use Netflix ? Do you have a favorite show ? ",Curious to dive deeper
1061," Yeah, I do it use it! I just finished watching that new Netflix show called You. Have you seen it?",Happy
1061," No, I did not seen it, but it was recommended by the algorithm, I like shows that are produced in house by Netflix, especially those that came from Asia. ",Neutral
1061," It was pretty good, Netflix seems to produce some pretty good shows. Netflix and youtube create half the internet traffic in North America. ",Happy
1061," That is crazy, I imagine that Blockbuster is regretting their decision to buy Netflix for 50 million. ",Neutral
1061," Yeah, are there even any block busters left anymore? I do miss going in to pick out a movie sometimes.",Happy
1061," I don't miss that much, especially the late fees. ",Disgusted
1061," Yeah, that's one thing that was annoying. I think I racked up so many fees from forgetting to bring stuff back. ",Happy
1061," They had a positive side, they inspired the founder of Netflix. ",Neutral
1061," That's a good thing! Well, it was nice chatting with you!",Happy
1061," You too, I wish you plenty of good shows on Netflix.",Happy
1062," Hey there, I am really into music, art, poetry and concerts. The Kennedy Center is a place i've never been to yet.",Curious to dive deeper
1062," Hello. Interesting. Are we speed dating here? If so, my favorite band is the Foo Fighters, they play loud enough to show up on seismic monitors.",Curious to dive deeper
1062," HA, yeah I guess it does have that fun fact speedy kinda feel,lol. Yeah, Foo fighters are amazing. I have to brag and say I have seen the Ramones in person decades ago, I am one of their 2,263 concerts.",Curious to dive deeper
1062,You are? That's interesting. I cannot believe ABBA turned down a billion to do a tour.,Curious to dive deeper
1062,ABBA scored my favorite musical Mamma Mia too.,Surprised
1062," I haven't seen that one yet, is it good? I think it's hilarous that a woman on her way to the Dave Matthews concert, helped him while he was stranded.",Surprised
1062," Awww, thats awesome. I wanna meet or be stranded on the side of the road now, kind of. Yes, Mamma Mia is good but the music is epic. I used to like Creed until I heard that they aren't very good in person. They were even sued for an awful concert in the past.",Curious to dive deeper
1062," Oh, i can believe that. I have been to a Creed concert. It wasn't great in my opinion. Did you know there are steam pianos? They can be heard for miles.",Curious to dive deeper
1062," Awe, I never heard of that but it seems like it would be glorious. I would love to learn to play. I learned of an aluminium grand piano. ",Curious to dive deeper
1062," I'm not musical, but I would love to hear both. I find it interesting that music, art and poetry were once olympic sports.",Curious to dive deeper
1062," Oh yeah, that is amazing. What a cool combo, it makes sense. I was impressed by this aluminum piano that was built for the airship Hindenburg. It only weighed 356lbs.",Curious to dive deeper
1062," A mute man in England can only communicate by piano, that would be amazing to hear.",Curious to dive deeper
1062," Oh my, what a gift to be born with. I recently heard about a poem that when read normally is depressing but when read backwards is inspiring. That is my kind of poetry and maybe I could understand it.",Curious to dive deeper
1062,Tupac Shakur studied poetry in high school I guess that's why his rap is more poetry than gangsta.,Curious to dive deeper
1062," Oh yeah, cool. I like rap and that's probably why because some of it is very poetic. The japanese alphabet, when recited in order forms a poem,too.",Curious to dive deeper
1062," The vikings were very fond of poetry, as well.",Neutral
1062," Oh okay. Almost all of the hobbits characters names were taken out of old poems, dvergatal.",Curious to dive deeper
1062," I did not, as I have never read any of the books. The vikings consider poetry, a gift from Odin ",Neutral
1062," Oh cool, a gift from Odin. Ya know, Edgar Allen Poe only received $9 for the peon the Raven. I guess money does not live on like poetry.",Curious to dive deeper
1062," Back then, that was a lot of money. It still is, when you factor in inflation. Nixon wrote a piano concerto, I didn't know he studied music.",Surprised
1062," I never knew that either, I did know that Pink Floyd played for an empty amphitheatre in Pompeii, that had to be awesome.",Surprised
1062," thank you for chatting with me, enjoy your day.",Neutral
1063," Do you subscribe to Netflix?  As of Oct. 2018, they had 137M subscribers.",Curious to dive deeper
1063," I used to, but I haven't been with them for awhile.  Might if I ever get some extra money rolling in.  LOL.  But yeah, it's amazing how HUGE they are!",Surprised
1063,They are!  From 9pm to 12am they use 33% of bandwidth in N. America.,Surprised
1063,Did you know the guy who invented it came up with the idea after racking up a $40 late fee on a vhs rental?  That's kind of funny!,Surprised
1063," Yeah.  Turning anger into riches.  I love it.  Later, Blockbuster declined several offers to buy Netflix for nothing compared to what it's worth now.",Neutral
1063," Yeah, I heard about that.  They were offered to buy it for $50 and they said no, now it's worth like $2 billion!  I bet someone is kicking themselves over missing out on that!",Surprised
1063,For sure... Here's a head-scratcher... Some people think the universe in one big superhologram...,Curious to dive deeper
1063," Like something out of The Matrix?  Yeah, I guess it's possible, but even if it was there's no way to know, so you'd really just have to keep living ""as is"" (if that makes sense.)",Surprised
1063,I agree.  Did you know there are stars cold enough to be touched.  Does that mean cold fusion is a real thing?,Curious to dive deeper
1063,That I can't tell ya... although I'd assume it just means there's stars out there that aren't very warm.  Good thing our sun isn't like that!  Speaking of space.. ever seen Wall-E?,Curious to dive deeper
1063,I watch part of it then fell asleep.  I didn't know it was derived from Walter ELIAS Disney...,Surprised
1063," Yeah, that's a neat little factoid.  Another neat thing is they got all sorts of hidden ""Mickeys"" (ie Mickey Head shapes) all over the various Disney resorts.  People make it a game to find them.",Surprised
1063,Are they worth anything?  I didn't realize Minnie Mouse's name is short for Minerva...,Surprised
1063," No, they're painted on various surfaces, you can't really take them with ya (unless you chip them out of the walls...) LOL",Happy
1063,I'm sure they wouldn't appreciate that.  I bet Netflix doesn't like paying 20 times more on postage than they do for bandwidth.,Neutral
1063," Yeah, that surprises me.  I didn't think too many still got the DVDs in the mail, but I guess there's still some people out where internet isn't so great so streaming isn't really an option.",Surprised
1063," Yeah, I was puzzled about that too.  Another weird theory: there is only one electron in the universe.  OK, this one is crazy...  ",Curious to dive deeper
1063,I'm not even sure how that would WORK given what he know about atoms and stuff.  Unless they're trying to say the electron is so BIG that the entire universe is in it... (shrugs),Surprised
1063," Yeah, it's crazy on the surface... Crazy like Disney's Big Hero 6 used a 55,000 core computer to render it.  Wow, I am typing this on a 4-core computer...  Humbling...",Surprised
1063,Wonder how long the film took to render on that thing?  Bet you could play a mean game of Fortnight (or whatever is big now) on a computer like that!  ;),Surprised
1063,For sure... That's one major computer... Thanks for your help.  You were and excellent chat partner!,Neutral
1064," Hello, do you like to go to a live concert?",Curious to dive deeper
1064,I do!  It has been a while for me though.  how about you?,Neutral
1064," Yes I do also!  Sometime I go see a band, or an orchestra!",Curious to dive deeper
1064," I teach band, I think that is really cool!",Neutral
1064," That's awesome!  One band I like is Linkin Park, they play 324 concerts in 2001 alone!  ",Curious to dive deeper
1064," Wow, that is almost like one per day!  the Ramones did that too, but for like 20 years!",Neutral
1064," That definitely makes you quite busy!  I've been to Rome, but Croatia has an ancient Roman amphitheater they still use for concerts!  That would be neat to see there.",Curious to dive deeper
1064,I wonder if that is the one Pink Floyd used to play a live concert to no one.,Neutral
1064," Maybe!  That is cool, I will have to look that concert up.  Speaking of band and music, do you like the piano?",Curious to dive deeper
1064," It has to be one of my favorite instruments, although I dont play it well.",Neutral
1064,It was invented over 300 years ago from an Italian name Bartolomeo Cristofori!  I would love to learn the piano.,Curious to dive deeper
1064,Maybe you could learn on the top of Britain's highest mountain there is a piano there.  Personally Id lke to how how it go there.,Neutral
1064,That is interesting!  How did it get there?  Another interesting thing is a aluminum grand piano was created for the airship hindenburg.  I wonder what the weight was.,Curious to dive deeper
1064," It was probably pretty light, maybe didnt sound too good.  But that wasnt the Hindenburg's biggest problem.",Neutral
1064,Not it wasn't!  Do you like Freddie Mercury or the band Queen?,Curious to dive deeper
1064,They are probably one of my favorites!,Neutral
1064,As is mine!  Freddie Mercury used the same piano to record Bohemian Rhapsody as Paul Mccartney used to record Hey Jude.  That would be so cool to see that piano for the history it has.,Curious to dive deeper
1064,Wow!  That is pretty incredible.  Id love to see it.  I wonder if it made its way to a museum somehow.,Surprised
1064,Hopefully it is somewhere safe!  Beside music I like to read poetry.  Do you like poetry?,Curious to dive deeper
1064," Some, I am interested to see the poem Demetri Martin wrote.",Neutral
1064," Has to be pretty funny being from Demetri!  Well it was nice talking to you, have a great day!",Curious to dive deeper
1064,Same here!  Bye!,Neutral
1065,Hello!  do you like watching concerts?,Happy
1065," yes I do love concerts, I want to see the concert put on by 81 year old Philip glass",Happy
1065,Is he the one that is playing at the Kennedy Center?,Happy
1065," yes he is, it sounds like hes been preparing for this concert for a long time. I just want to support him because he's getting old",Happy
1065," Sounds like a good story he has.  In Croatia, there is an ancient Roman amphitheatre that is still used for concerts.  That would be interesting to see a show at.",Happy
1065,Yes I would love to visit there. I would also love to go to a dog concert LOL apparently they play high frequencies that only dogs can hear,Surprised
1065,lol  That's interesting!  Would be funny to see the dogs reactions.,Surprised
1065,Yep I wonder if they would enjoy the music? Do you enjoy Abba's music by the way,Curious to dive deeper
1065,Hahaha I do because I grew up in the 70s and when I hear them it takes me back to being a kid.,Happy
1065," Yep I like Abba a lot, it's crazy that they turned down a billion dollars to do a 100 concert tour",Surprised
1065," Wow!  I didn't know that.  That's a lot of cash!  The Ramones played 2,263 shows over a 20 year span.  Bet they didn't come close to making that for their entire career.  lol",Happy
1065,Haha that's a good point! Do you ever listen to Foo Fighters? Apparently their concerts were so loud they show up on seismic monitors,Surprised
1065," I do listen to them!  Dave Grohl is actually from not far from where I live and his grandparents, parents, aunts, and uncles still live there.  He comes home a lot.  The Foo Fighters even played a show at a local record store.  It's on youtube look up foo fighters niles, ohio and you can watch it.",Happy
1065,Wow I'll have to check that out. Do you play any instruments by the way? I personally play the piano,Curious to dive deeper
1065," I play guitar.  Tried piano but for some reason I couldn't get it.  Thought I wouldn't have a problem because of the guitar.  But, I was wrong.  Did you know that Freddie Mercury and Paul McCartney used the same piano to record their hits ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and ""Hey Jude""?",Happy
1065," Wow that's very cool! Also cool is that steam pianos are a thing, you can actually hear their notes from miles away",Surprised
1065,I am going to have to look those up.  Sounds interesting.  They made an aluminum grand pianno for the lounge of the Hindenburg and it weighed only 356 pounds.  I wonder if it went down when the ship crashed?,Happy
1065," That would be sad if it did go down with the Zeppelin, very strange that Richard Nixon could play the piano and actually did a performance for The Tonight Show",Surprised
1065," I never knew that about him.  I wonder if that's on youtube?  On April 18, 1930 the BBC decided there was no news worth reporting so they broadcasted piano music instead.  lol",Happy
1065," That seems really nice! I wish they would do that today, what do you think about the mysterious mute man who they found in England and he could only communicate through with a piano, that should be a horror movie",Surprised
1065,Wow.  I never heard that story.  That's actually pretty interesting.  I have to get running. It was nice chatting with you today!,Happy
1066,Hello do you know any facts about netflix?,Curious to dive deeper
1066,I do like for a fact that the company has about 137 million of subscribers worldwide,Curious to dive deeper
1066,I can'be believe it's already been 20 years since the company was founded in 1997.,Happy
1066," Its been a long time I agree, it started as a DVD rental service and now its the biggest service out there",Curious to dive deeper
1066,It is.  From 9 PM to 12 AM Netflix accounts for 33 percent of allbandwidth in North America.  I'm part of that 33% lol,Happy
1066," I think I am too, did you know that in the year 2000 Netflix proposed Blockbuster to use them as an online service, Blockbuster laughed at the idea",Curious to dive deeper
1066,They should have taken them up on it and they would still be in business. lol,Happy
1066," I know right, I bet they are regretting that decision big time Netflix is a giant of the industry now",Curious to dive deeper
1066," They are for sure!  Together with youtube, they make up half of the peak internet traffic in North America.  So that means 1/2 the people online are watching videos.  lol",Happy
1066,I guess both services are really popular did you know Netflix has 150 movies with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes? great content,Curious to dive deeper
1066,I will have to go check that out.  Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth.  Pretty pricey but that's how they get subscribers to rent the new movies on dvd.,Happy
1066," I guess they still have the DVD service, so what are your thoughts on the universe?",Curious to dive deeper
1066,I think that it may be one giant superhologram from what I've read.,Happy
1066," A lot of crazy theories out there, could be right also the one that we exist inside of a black hole",Curious to dive deeper
1066,There is also a theory that there is only one electron in the universe.,Happy
1066," Yeah I heard that one as well and think its crazy, but  I like to keep an open mind our model of the universes has advanced a lot since Copernicus, Newton",Curious to dive deeper
1066,Yes lol  There are stars in the known universe that are cold enough to be touched by the human hand.  How would they even know this?,Happy
1066," Years and years of science and improvement, but the curious thing is that the more we learn about the universe the more questions we have about it",Curious to dive deeper
1066,I agree!  Do you watch Disney at all?  Bill Ney was the science consultant for Disney's Flubber.  I had no idea.  It's bee fun chatting with you!,Happy
1066,I am a fan of Disney movies and I didnt know that I watch the movie but I guess I didnt pay much attention to that detail. It's been great chatting with you as well.,Surprised
1066,Have a good night!,Happy
1067," Hello, how are you? Do you watch Netflix?",Curious to dive deeper
1067,I'm doing great! I watch Netflix occasionally - just another one of the 137 million people that do. Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
1067," Yes, I do too! I have other places also, like Hulu and Amazon prime. Think blockbuster made a mistake.",Surprised
1067,Blockbuster made the same mistake other companies like Toys R Us and Sears did by not playing the online market. Netflix took a risk and hit it big that way.,Neutral
1067," Yes, true. That $40 late fee was inspiring!",Happy
1067,That's one nice thing about online streaming. They can't very well charge a late fee!,Happy
1067,I use Netflix and YouTube also in the evening usually.  Peak internet traffic time.,Neutral
1067,It's amazing that everything still streams so smoothly when Netflix sometimes gets up to 33% of all bandwidth in North America.,Surprised
1067,Yes it does. Good idea of google to use goats to keep lawn mowed!,Surprised
1067,I bet Google could make some money off that if they started filming the goats and streaming them on something like Netflix. People love watching animals do the most random things.,Neutral
1067," Oh yes, like that. A single google search computes alot of power!",Surprised
1067,It has to when it searches the entire web and generates millions of results at a time! A five minute downtime in 2013 accounted for 40% of web traffic.,Neutral
1067,I believe it! Do you like Tesla?,Curious to dive deeper
1067," I don't have any personal experience with the company, but I'm really intrigued to see where they go with their ideas. Elon Musk is so innovative.",Neutral
1067," Yes, i think so. Didn't know Toyota owns %10 of Tesla.",Surprised
1067," I wonder if they want to make sure not to miss out on a potentially successful new car idea, like doing the opposite of Blockbuster and buying into their industry's ""Netflix.""",Curious to dive deeper
1067,could be? I love driving electric cars. No sound. lol,Happy
1067," I've never driven one, but I can see the appeal of that! So many people around here drive big trucks with even bigger engines and you can hear the rev, rrrrev, RRREVing from across the neighborhood. A quiet Tesla sounds nice.",Neutral
1067," lol, I love big trucks too! All American!! Didn't know Tesla helped to develop Toyota's 2nd Gen Rav4 Great Chat!",Surprised
1067," That's true, big trucks are awesome for a lot of things. My mom drives one! Not a Toyota, though. I wonder if Tesla's made any big trucks. Great chatting with you too!",Neutral
1067,Good idea!,Happy
1068,do you use Google?,Curious to dive deeper
1068,Yes a lot. Do you know how much computing power a single search requires?,Curious to dive deeper
1068,yes more than it took to take Neil and 11 others to the moon,Curious to dive deeper
1068,Yeah. Do you know how they calculate traffic?,Curious to dive deeper
1068,Yes they take the average with which android devices move in traffic,Curious to dive deeper
1068,Yeah And once they hired goats instead of people to mow the lawn,Curious to dive deeper
1068," SO good, they are really creative with stuff like this sometimes",Curious to dive deeper
1068,Yeah true. ANd they once went down for 5 minutes and took with them 40% of the traffic in the web,Curious to dive deeper
1068,Wow. Do you watch Netflix?,Curious to dive deeper
1068,Yes I do. They account for one third of bandwidth in NA in the morning,Curious to dive deeper
1068,No surprises there together with youtube they account for half of the peak traffic,Curious to dive deeper
1068," Yes. And they still spend more on postage than on bandwidth, 20 times more",Curious to dive deeper
1068,Yeah. Did you ever use Blockbuster?,Curious to dive deeper
1068," Yes when there was no Netflix, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1068," Me too. They had a chance to buy it but did not , too bad",Curious to dive deeper
1068,Yes and for just millions they could have made billions,Curious to dive deeper
1068,True. DO you know how the idea for it came by?,Curious to dive deeper
1068,Yes the guy who started it got a late $40 fee on a VHS,Curious to dive deeper
1068,Yeah. DO you like cars?,Curious to dive deeper
1068,I love cars and my favorite brand is Tesla. Do you like them?,Curious to dive deeper
1068,I sure do they are good cars. It was nice chatting with you.,Happy
1069," Hello,  do you like Netflix?",Surprised
1069,I used to be a subscriber but not now.,Neutral
1069," I see,  it's a great service.  Looks like Netflix spends more money on postage than bandwidth,  that's really interesting! ",Surprised
1069," I heard that.  So much for ""old school"".  I heard Netflix was inspired by a late fee on a video rental.  Funny...",Curious to dive deeper
1069," That's hilarious!  I guess that's when all the good ideas come to someone,  when they are fed up with what already exists. ",Surprised
1069,Yep.  Netflix is bringing back some 80s comic book stuff like Voltron.  I prefer Walt Disney cartoons like good ol' Mickey Mouse myself.,Curious to dive deeper
1069," Voltron!  What a classic,  that's amazing!  ",Surprised
1069," Yeah, I had forgotten about Voltron.  'She-Ra and the Princesses of Power' somehow escaped me.  Nextflix is doing that too.",Curious to dive deeper
1069," Omg,  really?  I use to love She-Ra,  saying it now sounds kinda funny.  Like what kind of name is that lol I also,  like Walt Disney,  Did you know Wall-e was named after walt disney?",Surprised
1069," I didn't know that.  To each their own... Why take to fantasy things when the universe is fantastic enough?  Ya know, there are suns that a cold enough to touch?",Curious to dive deeper
1069,I think you mean stars!  Got it!  Yeah isn't that amazing!,Surprised
1069,They are synonyms.  I think dark matter and dark energy is a fascinating riddle.  Much like the theory that  universe may be one giant superhologram,Curious to dive deeper
1069," yeah,  I wonder what makes them think that.  ",Surprised
1069,I don't know.  I may be the same people that think the moon landings were faked.  Like the Blockbuster people that refused to buy NetFlix -- Doh!,Curious to dive deeper
1069," Yeah,  what a missed opportunity on their part!  They would still be in business if they had bought Netflix!",Surprised
1069,Yep.   I bet they wished they had that one back.,Neutral
1069,Can you believe that Netflix and YouTube make up half of the internet traffic in America?,Surprised
1069,Wow.  I guess I won't feel guilty streaming EVER.,Neutral
1069," lol I absolutely love that nowadays we don't have to been home at a certain time to watch a show,  streaming has changed lives!",Surprised
1069,Yes.  That and my beloved DVR.,Neutral
1069," Agreed!  lol Well, its been fun,  have a good one. ",Surprised
1070," Hi, how are you this morning?",Happy
1070," Hello, I am good, thank you.",Happy
1070,Do you subscribe to Netflix?,Curious to dive deeper
1070," No. I do not. But I have a question. If Google were to operate in China, what it would look like? The project called Dragonfly, is already performing to the satisfaction of Google executives..",Curious to dive deeper
1070,Not sure about that.  I do know a single Google search requires more computing power than it took to send Neil Armstrong and eleven astronauts to the moon.,Curious to dive deeper
1070," Ha ha... What Do you think about Musk, who agreed to pay $20 millions fine and step aside, as Tesla chairman for three years to settle charges?",Curious to dive deeper
1070,Doesn't shock me at all.,Neutral
1070,Yes. It was quite interesting for me to see early versions of google moon using pictures of cheese for the closest zoom level? What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
1070," Sounds cool, I've never seen that.  I do know that Google maps calculates traffic by tracking how fast android devices are moving on the road.",Surprised
1070," Oh, I did not know that , thank you. Yes, It reminds me of  when google launched  gmail. At first ""g-mail"" was the name of a free email service offered by garfield`s website, brings so much memories, good old days.",Curious to dive deeper
1070," Yeah, google does it all.  You know when there is a disputed border, Google maps tailors its maps to the claims of each country where the internet browser is located?",Curious to dive deeper
1070,Very interesting. I am in aw.,Neutral
1070," I bet, what's even more interesting is that Google went down August 16, 2013 and took 40% of web traffic with it!",Surprised
1070,Sure it is. Speaking about Netflix earlier. Did you know that Netflix has a movie that is nothing but an hour long video of a fireplace for your home? I am assuming some kind of screen saver.,Curious to dive deeper
1070,It's actually quite popular around the holidays for people to sit and watch that log burning in the fireplace.  Who would have thunk it?  I read somwhere that Google once used goats to mow the grass around their headquarters instead of  people.,Surprised
1070," What? That`s odd?! But Google is quite efficient when it comes down to using electricity, their data center uses about 0.01% of a total worldwide electricity use.",Curious to dive deeper
1070," Yes, they are.  Getting back to Netflix, did you know they spend 20 times more on postage than on bandwidth?",Surprised
1070," No. But I am not surprised. As of October 2018, Netflix has 137 million total subscribers worldwide, including 58.46 million in the United States. They mean business. ",Curious to dive deeper
1070," Yes, they do.  Did you realize Blockbuster turned down several offers to buy Netflix for $5o million and now Netflix is worth $2 Billion.  Can you say Blockbuster, who?",Surprised
1070," Yes, right? In 2000 Netflix proposed that blockbusters should use Netflix as its online service and blockbuster laughed them out of office.",Curious to dive deeper
1070," Big mistake, HUGE!  Well, it's been nice chatting with you friend.  Have a good day!",Happy
1071," Hi, do you enjoy music?",Curious to dive deeper
1071," Hi, yes I do although I have not been to a concert recently.  I have to say I never even saw the Ramones even though they toured almost non stop for over 20 years.",Neutral
1071,Linkin Park played 324 concerts in 2001 alone! That's a lot of shows!,Surprised
1071,Yes it is!  I'd like to go to a concert in an ancient roman amphitheater.  I understand Croatia has one still in use..,Neutral
1071,I wonder if Creed has ever played there. I am sure they would be sued for their performance there too.,Sad
1071,Lol! I've heard about that. Didn't they get sued back in 2002 for a bad concert?,Neutral
1071,Yes! I remember that issue. He played for 10 minutes passed out and then called it art... The concert lasted 10 minutes and had him passed out on stage. Light weight!,Curious to dive deeper
1071,He passed out after 10 minutes! No wonder four people sued!,Neutral
1071,Not like a Pink Floyd show. In 1972 they recorded a live concert in the amphitheater with no audience!,Curious to dive deeper
1071," That's one way to keep from getting sued!  They could do anything and no one would know.  Speaking of no audience, I heard that a group of climbers reached the top of britain's highest mountain in 2006 and found a piano.",Neutral
1071,I read that and want to know who actually dragged a piano up there. You have to be dedicated to climbing and the piano!,Surprised
1071,Yes you do.  Even if you used the piano built for the hindenburg it would still be heavy. It was 356 pounds.,Neutral
1071,That's one great sherpa! There's a piano that freddie mercury used to write bohemian rhapsody and paul mccartney used for hey jude! Now thats a good piano!,Surprised
1071," Agreed!  Say, back in 1930 the bbc decided there was no news worth reporting so they broadcast piano music instead. Don't you think they should do that in this day and time?",Neutral
1071,That's too much piano for my desire... I get irritated with the news but must be a glutton for punishment because I still watch it. Although I would like to hear the stress test song...,Happy
1071,The stress test song?,Neutral
1071,Yeah. I guess it is not playable by humans...,Surprised
1071,So is it played by computer then?,Neutral
1071," Yes. Unlike other forms of art, like poetry, which is done by humans.",Curious to dive deeper
1071,Poetry dates way back to prehistoric times.  Interesting when you think about it.,Neutral
1071,Agreed. There is a 224 word Palindrome! Nice chatting with you.,Happy
1072," Hi, how are you? Are you into music?",Neutral
1072,I love several kinds of music.  I have been to concerts in big venue settings.  How about you?,Neutral
1072," I don't go to concerts much now. No time, little money. What have you gone to recently?",Curious to dive deeper
1072,Garth Brooks in a stadium.  One music group played 324 concerts in one year.  That had to be exhausting.,Neutral
1072," They must have been youngsters. 324 is almost one a day. I guess they had a great fan base, plus a strong album to tour on.",Neutral
1072,It was Linkin Park.  That was back in 2001.,Neutral
1072,Linkin Park. I think their singer died. Too bad. Very popular band. One of the best selling of this century.,Neutral
1072," The Ramones played over 2200 in 20 years.  I hated travelling for business, so that must have been excruciating.",Neutral
1072,I guess they had a tremendous support team. I don't like travelling but the riders for the contracts must have given them everything they ever needed to be comfortable.,Neutral
1072,Good point.  They probably did not go far each day with a well planned itinerary.  In Croatia there is an ancient Roman theater that is still used for concerts.,Neutral
1072," I guess the seats are comfortable? Seems like everything would be stone. I guess the acoustics are ""classic."" Did the Ramones ever play there? I wonder.",Curious to dive deeper
1072," I somehow doubt it.  Croatia has only recently become free enough to be on western concert tours.  There was a Creed concert in 2002 that was so bad, some of the audience sued them.",Neutral
1072," Maybe Creed should have practiced in an empty stadium, or started their tour in Croatia. Sued? Wow. They must have been terrible.",Neutral
1072,They must have had free legal service or one of them was a lawyer.  Have you ever heard recordings of Vladimir Horowitz playing a piano?,Neutral
1072," I don't think so. I've heard his name, so maybe I've heard him.",Neutral
1072,He had a marvelous concert grand.  Great pianists clamor to play it today.  Freddie Mercury us the same piano for Bohemian Rhapsody and Paul McCartney used for Hey Jude,Neutral
1072,There must be magic in that piano. Probably more that the one that a group of climbers found on the top of Britain's highest mountain,Neutral
1072,No doubt.  The UK mountain must be short enough for a helicopter to elevate above it.  A piano is both a percussion instrument with the hammers and a stringed instrument because of the....wait for it...the strings.,Neutral
1072,The strings?! I had NO idea! Plus the highest mountain in the UK? Did the piano weigh less than the one on the Hindenburg?,Curious to dive deeper
1072,Undoubtedly not.  That Hindenburg piano was aluminum so it could be strong and light.,Neutral
1072," That makes sense. I wonder if it sounded good. Would Horowitz play it? Anyway, I enjoyed chatting!",Happy
1072,Likewise.  Good questions to end with.,Neutral
1073,Do you follow the NBA?,Curious to dive deeper
1073," I do, actually! What about you? I love Golden State's new championship rings and how they have a bristly texture with a perfect circle at the top to match the Oracle Arena!",Happy
1073," The Oracle Arena is impressive, I heard the diamonds are vast like 74 diamonds",Curious to dive deeper
1073,They are! It is so beautiful! So do you have a favorite? I like Tim Duncan because I admire how he elected to finish four years of college before joining the NBA. He sacrificed money for an education!,Happy
1073," I like Tim Duncan as well, I  think he made the right decision, I also used to like Michael Jordan, ",Curious to dive deeper
1073," Same here. In fact, did you know Air Jordan's were actually banned when they were introduced but Nike paid the fines each game so Jordan wore them anyway? That was a great way to market them!",Neutral
1073," I didnt know that, they paid for the fines? wow I bet those shoes generated lots of money a fine didnt matter",Curious to dive deeper
1073," Agreed! Well speaking of basketball, I heard that physicists have proved shooting granny style is the best  technique to score points on the line. However, NBA players refuse to use that method because it looks stupid. Can't say I blame them!",Neutral
1073," I would use that technique if I earned as much money as they do, wouldnt mind looking stupid",Curious to dive deeper
1073," You're right about that! After all, they are the best paid athletes in the world by average annual salary  so they shouldn't worry about looking silly or stupid.",Neutral
1073," I know right, so do you like Drake? that Canadian musician?",Curious to dive deeper
1073," I do, actually! I just can't believe he graduated high school at the age of 25 back in 2012. What about you?",Surprised
1073," That is crazy, I bet he grew in a poor family, I do like him, think he has a lot of talent",Curious to dive deeper
1073,He does. I like how he visited Drake University right after the students there gave up on trying to get Drake there during a tour stop!,Happy
1073," Canada has great artists, do you follow Justin Bieber as well?",Curious to dive deeper
1073," You're right, Canada does! I do also follow Justin Beiber and not the Justin Beiber who was banned from Facebook just for having the same name as the singer. That was just wrong for Facebook to do that. ",Angry
1073," It was, why ban that other guy, he is the author of the most diliked video in Youtube I guess a lot of haters out there. ",Curious to dive deeper
1073,So true! But can you believe Beiber has yet to have a number one single in both the US and Great Britain?,Surprised
1073," Yeah, I guess he is more popular in other countries, sounds like he has a great heart as well he granted 200 wishes in the make a wish foundation",Curious to dive deeper
1073,That is very admirable! So nice of him to do that! I'm glad he gives back after becoming the first artist to have seven songs from a debut chart on the Billboard Top 100!,Happy
1073," He is the first artist really? wow that is impressive, I like his music, ",Curious to dive deeper
1074," Hi turker, do you like NBA, If yes, do you like the Golden State Warriors?",Happy
1074,I don't pay much attention to basketball. I've heard most of their players actually end up under financial stress after retirement,Neutral
1074," I didn't know that, because they make good money, maybe bad Investments.",Surprised
1074," It's possible. One former player chose upfront money over a stake in Nike, which was a bad financial decision on his end",Surprised
1074," Ok, but I think Michael Jordan made lots of money from Nike shoes and shirts, I guess it depends on your nba performance.",Surprised
1074," True. The league wasn't formed until the 1940s, which is fairly recent compared to other popular sports",Surprised
1074,The think that a player like Steph Curry would make a good living after retirement for him and his family.,Curious to dive deeper
1074," He seems to have a good head on his shoulder. Tim Duncan is another one. Instead of going directly into the NBA, he stayed in college for four years",Curious to dive deeper
1074," I always like to see Tim Duncan play, because he was a cool player and easy going, never really get upset while playing.",Curious to dive deeper
1074,That's really cool. One thing I don't get is why Coach Stan Van Gundy was fined. All he said was that he didn't think they should play games on Christmas,Curious to dive deeper
1074," Yes that did sound strange, I didn't know the reason for his comment, did you know the reason for that comment?",Surprised
1074,Not sure. I guess it's one of those things we'll never know. One thing I do know is that Just Bieber has the most disliked video on YouTube,Curious to dive deeper
1074," It doesn't surprise me too much, such a young guy when he started, but lived as an adult.",Surprised
1074,He was on an episode of MTV's silent library when he was only 15. That's pretty young,Surprised
1074," Yes, I like a few of his songs when he first became famous. As he grew older that change. Did you know the nba was found in New York City on June  1946.",Curious to dive deeper
1074,Of course it was in NY. They even have international offices there,Surprised
1074," Yes, I thought Reggie Miller was a pretty good three pointer, he was another cool player almost like Tim Duncan.",Curious to dive deeper
1074," If you take the average per playter, basketball players are actually the best paid athletes in the world. I guess that shows how much of a team sport it is",Surprised
1074," Yes, you are right, what do you think about wnba? Have you watched one game?",Curious to dive deeper
1074," No, I don't usually watch television at all, let alone sports. Of the four major sports leagues in the US, the NBA isn't one I keep up on much",Neutral
1074," Ok, nba player allen Iverson signed a lifetime contract through reebok for $800,000 a year until age 55, wow.",Curious to dive deeper
1074,That's pretty legit. I wonder how much they make through sponsorships along,Curious to dive deeper
1075,Hi are you a fan of Justin Bieber or now any interesting things about him?,Curious to dive deeper
1075," I know nothing about him. well, he is canadian. what do you know?",Neutral
1075,I know that he was discovered on youtube in 2008 and was signed to a record deal.,Happy
1075,I wonder how many people ahve been discovered on youtube. I guess he must be worth 10 of millions by now.,Neutral
1075,I bet.  His first full length studio album My World 2.0 debuted in 2010 at number 1 in several countries.,Happy
1075,I think the fans skew pretty young. i know that one of his videos is the most hated on youtube. i dont know why.,Neutral
1075,lol Not everyone had the Bieber fever.,Happy
1075,I cant imagine that he can go on much longer. he is getting old and the new generation will want someone younger.,Neutral
1075,Yes.  He does some nice things for charity.  He has granted 200 wishes for the make a wish foundation.  It's the most ever done by a recording artist.,Happy
1075," He does a great job with the fans, i guess. i am not into his music. i am probably too old. LOL",Neutral
1075,No.  Never too old.  Just a different generation.  Bieber has never had a number one single in the U.S. or Great Britain.  Interesting seeing how is albums were No. 1's. lol,Happy
1075,I guess the fans bought them but there wasnt much radio play?,Neutral
1075," That could be.  There was a Justin Bieber, a guy in his 30s, who was banned from Facebook for sharing the same name with the famous celebrity.  Crazy.",Happy
1075," Yeah, that is weird. but the people with the money have the lawyers to make the rules. Tom Cruise did something like that.",Neutral
1075,That's just pathetic in my book.  It just doesn't seem right to do that.  Do you like basketball at all?,Happy
1075,I do like basketball. played when i was younger. not now though. too old LOL,Neutral
1075,Out of the 30 teams do you have a favorite one?  Mine is the Cavs because I'm from there originally.,Happy
1075," I like Golden State. I like steph curry. I do like LeBron. people say he betrayed cleveland, but i dont know what i would have done in his position.",Neutral
1075," I know I would have taken the money and set up kids and my grandchildren up for life. lol  Although when came back,  I didn't think he would leave again.  Oh well.  Did you know that Air Jordan's were banned by the NBA but Michael Jordan wore them anyhow because Nike was willing to pay the fine for each game?  It's been fun chatting with you!",Happy
1075," Yeah, Nike got a bargain in my opinion. Great chatting!",Neutral
1075,Have a great night!,Happy
1076," hello, first king to travel was kalakaua of hawaii, that's pretty interesting",Curious to dive deeper
1076," It is, he had a lot of oceans to cross.",Surprised
1076,yeah guess I shoulda said travel around the world,Happy
1076," I knew what you mean, just with Hawaii being an island, there is no connecting land.",Neutral
1076,you want to test out the 160mph commuter bus by the dutch?,Happy
1076," Yeah, I kind of think that would be neat.  Very efficient for sure.",Neutral
1076,they should send that to iceland so that they dont have to fly short distances,Happy
1076,True.  Since there is no rail there that would be perfect.,Neutral
1076,Not so economical if they have high tolls like the $300 tolls to travel the length of japan,Happy
1076," That is high, but kind of like what it would be to travel the US by car if all interstates were toll roads.",Neutral
1076,yeah our tolls are pretty high too but you can avoid if you're willing to give up some time.,Surprised
1076,Very true.  Travel is important.  Is there anywhere you want to go?,Neutral
1076," I'm heading to japan in May. Did you see in the clothing section about Rip Curl making clothes in North Korea and labeling them as ""Made in China""?",Happy
1076," No, thats odd.  Did you know that pilgrim clothes were actually full color?",Neutral
1076," yeah, weird right? When I think of pilgrims, I think pretty drab clothing.",Surprised
1076," Same here.  Apple has even had a clothing line, back in 1986",Neutral
1076,Those Apple clothes are probably worth some serious $$$ now.,Happy
1076,Definitely.  I think it is probably one of the few failed ventures of apple.,Neutral
1076,See this one under Gucci about the first woman to run a major motion picture studio who sold toilet paper on which she put the gucci logo?,Surprised
1076,Wow.  I didnt know there was a market for gucci toilet paper.,Neutral
1076,How about gucci's name guccio gucci. Just call me GG,Happy
1076,Wow.  I didnt know the first name was Guccio.  That is kinda of crazy.,Neutral
1076,I wonder if Rick Harrison was ever charged with selling fake Gucci bags?,Surprised
1076,That is crazy.  He might have been caught.,Neutral
1077," Hi there, are you into fashion at all?",Curious to dive deeper
1077,Not that much although I wonder what Miguel Cabarllo's bulletproof clothing looks like,Curious to dive deeper
1077,Me either. I try to stay trendy and I appreciate the artistic side. What is cool is that humans decided at some point that clothing is necessary and we are the only species to do it.,Surprised
1077," Yea, although people like the Greeks didn't make the smartest fashion choices by putting asbestos into their clothing",Surprised
1077," Still, it's uniquely human and it varies greatly depending on body type, social and geographic considerations. Including the Greeks haha.",Happy
1077,Ironically there is an African tribe that still wears victorian clothing even after the Germans who introduced it left,Neutral
1077,Did you know that the Pilgrims clothing was actually very colorful?,Curious to dive deeper
1077," No, i figured it was just black. Did you know people used to use Old Faithful to do their laundry on?",Neutral
1077,You mean the geyser at Yellowstone?,Curious to dive deeper
1077," Yep, people would just put their clothes on the geyser and wait for it to erupt",Neutral
1077,Haha that seems like a pretty dangerous eruption. Like all of a sudden it could explode and blast your clothes into the sky,Surprised
1077,Yea but I wonder if using a geyser would be able to get asbestos out of clothing,Curious to dive deeper
1077,I imagine it gets almost everything. Except oil. Nothing gets oil out.,Happy
1077," Yea, oil sucks. DId you know a man in China wore 70 clothing items just to avoid bagging fees",Curious to dive deeper
1077,I wonder how he was able to fit into one seat. I would be annoyed if I had to sit next to him.,Neutral
1077,That would suck. Did you know airports make travelers walk farther just so they don't have to fetch baggage off planes faster?,Curious to dive deeper
1077,That's interesting. Do you travel a lot?,Curious to dive deeper
1077," I try to, it's disappointing to know air travel is down 10% than it was in the 1960s",Sad
1077,That is disappointing. We wouldn't be able to see the world without like the king of Hawaii.,Neutral
1077,I wish I could travel like the garden gnomes people steal and take pictures of to send back to their owners,Neutral
1077,I'd like to see Iceland. Apparently they have to use domestic flights to get around from town to town,Neutral
1077," That sucks. Well I have to go, nice chatting with you",Neutral
1078,This 2005 photo shows a Natalee Holloway missing poster after she vanished on a class trip to Aruba.,Happy
1078," That's very sad, and really makes you especially think about the importance of female empowerment by brands Yves Saint Laurent",Curious to dive deeper
1078," They were perched atop chunky-heeled sandals, wearing flat-topped wide-brimmed hats.",Happy
1078," Then again, some people feel that the brand pushes an unrealistic, hyper sexual image on women that is harmful- for example, making women believe that they will be sexier with spindly filly-like legs",Curious to dive deeper
1078,One model's breasts were fully exposed but adorned with feathers.,Neutral
1078,Yes that's true and they made some women go with no top and just purple paint on their breasts. It definitely seems unrealistically sexual and exploitative.,Disgusted
1078," It was firmly rooted in the vision of its founder and namesake, Yves Saint Laurent, who celebrated female sexual power by blurring gender norms and experimenting with androgyny. ",Neutral
1078,Yes I heard the work recalled the work of Hedi Slimane who is a Celine designer who makes rebellious cloths for girls.,Curious to dive deeper
1078,Saint Laurent was founded in 1961 with a focus on women and their sexuality.,Happy
1078,I heard that some people see this type of fashion as a bit of a rethinking of our classic Western art which features many nudes.,Curious to dive deeper
1078,Dior casts its gaze on beauty. Chanel tangles with independence and liberation.,Happy
1078,And they say Louis Vuitton's history dates back to very far back.,Curious to dive deeper
1078," do you know Over the years, as the brand dressed the likes of Catherine Deneuve, it firmly embedded itself into French culture. ",Happy
1078," Yep, ultimately it sounds like Saint Laurent is all about glorification of the female form. ",Curious to dive deeper
1078,Some most definitely looked as though they were willing themselves not to shiver. Saint Laurent Spring/Summer 2019 collection,Happy
1078,Yeah I wouldn't want to be one of those models. I would much rather model for a brand like Hermes who are known primarily for their craft skill.,Curious to dive deeper
1078,The dutch are creating a commuter bus designed to travel at 160mph.,Happy
1078," That sounds quite dangerous! That's in stark contrast with a place like Mackinac Island, MI where motorized vehicles are banned and people travel by carriage.",Curious to dive deeper
1078," Rick harrison dropped out of high school in order to pursue his $2,000-a-week business of selling fake gucci bags.",Neutral
1078,Wow that's crazy but too bad he was basically stealing. However I was amused to learn that Dapper Dan is a real person!,Curious to dive deeper
1078,thank you,Happy
1079," Hi, are you a dog person? Dogs are the only animals other then elephants that instinctively understand pointing.",Curious to dive deeper
1079,I am and that's pretty cool. I know there are 12 different blood types for dogs and that they can donate.,Curious to dive deeper
1079,That is crazy! I've been reading a lot about dogs lately but I did not know that. Obviously humans have had dogs around a long time but I'm surprised they are the first domesticated. I would have thought cats.,Curious to dive deeper
1079," Did you know google is a ""dog"" company.  It's even in their code of conduct. ",Curious to dive deeper
1079," Yes! When I googled information on dogs that came up! I guess because dogs perform so many roles for humans. They are more like ""man's best helper"" then just ""friend"".",Curious to dive deeper
1079," Your right., hunting, police, and military to name a few. ",Curious to dive deeper
1079,Yes. It's crazy to think how many have actual jobs. It's much more common today to see people with service dogs also.,Curious to dive deeper
1079,Yes that's true. I just found out that dogs are not really color blind. Did you know that?,Curious to dive deeper
1079," Yes, but I don't think their vision is as good as ours at least as far as seeing colors. ",Curious to dive deeper
1079,Your probably right but i always thought they were completely color blind. Did you see the wonder women movie?,Curious to dive deeper
1079," Yes actually, it's great. Did you know Gal Gadot didn't even know she was auditioning for Wonder Woman. She thought it was for Catwoman lol.",Curious to dive deeper
1079,Wow how'd she miss that..lol. I think she did a good job i was skeptical at first. Now it's the highest grossing female superhero movie.,Curious to dive deeper
1079,Yeah she's really an interesting person outside of being an actress. She served in the Israeli defense force for 2 years! She might not be wonder woman in real life but she can still take on bad guys.,Surprised
1079,Yeah that's awesome i did not know that. i think the film grossed nearly or helped the dceu push pass 3 billion.,Curious to dive deeper
1079," That sure is a lot of money! It's interesting how the character of Wonder Woman has progressed over the decades. Not sure if you ever read any of the old comics, but when she first appeared in the justice society they made her their secretary! that wouldn't fly these days.",Curious to dive deeper
1079,Your Right!! did you know that apple had a clothing line?,Curious to dive deeper
1079," Yes actually! They are worth mega bucks these days. I recently got into vintage clothing, well I discovered some old clothes I had are now worth money lol. No apple shirts anymore though.",Surprised
1079,Right! I am happy for wonder women.,Curious to dive deeper
1079," Ok? Anyway my dog is really barking, I think someone is walking to the door. Either that or he just wants food.",Neutral
1079,Dogs are very good friends i miss mine. In Istanbul they have a vending machine that releases food and water for city stray's.,Curious to dive deeper
1079,And people here forget about their dogs in their cars and they die. I wish they had stuff like that here. Anyway I should be going. It was nice talking with you. I learned a lot more about dogs.,Happy
1079,Yeah that's horrible but they often forget about their children too. that's a shame! Anyway nice chatting with you!,Curious to dive deeper
1079,Have a great night.,Happy
1079,You too my friend!,Curious to dive deeper
1080,Did you know scientists think we have hiccups because evolved from land animals that had lungs as well as gills? Do you think that could be true?,Curious to dive deeper
1080,Possibbly,Surprised
1080," I think I remember in school learning that there are over 7 million species of animals on earth, but I think I also remember learning that we're discovering new ones often, especially in the rain forests and oceans.",Curious to dive deeper
1080,Where had you heard about that?,Curious to dive deeper
1080," In school. I was very interested in animals always, and even read more than I was assigned for school. I learned about the loch ness monster, too. It's a protected species, even!",Happy
1080,I have read about that. I believe it has been protected for nearly a century.,Curious to dive deeper
1080," There's some really cute loch ness monster movies, too. I remember being so jealous of a friend who got a job studying frogs in their environment at a pond. ",Neutral
1080,I do not think I have ever heard the Loch Ness monster described as cute before. Do you like prehistoric reptiles?,Curious to dive deeper
1080," Yes, I think I like nearly all living things. One of my favorite things I learned in school about animals was their ecosystems and habits. I loved to learn how many different things interact with each other.",Happy
1080,There are a lot of  animals to learn about.,Happy
1080," Germany really likes animals, I think. I've heard they have constitutional rights for animals. I bet the have lots of pets, too.",Curious to dive deeper
1080,I like animals as much as the next person but writing them into the constitution seems like overkill.,Happy
1080,I wonder if Germany also taxes them! There's a joke about wildlife in the US where it makes fun of how you must pay for a hunting license but yet if you run over an animal that damages your car you don't get money back.,Neutral
1080,Would they pay their taxes in kibble.,Surprised
1080," They might even make the wild animals pay land taxes! lol Seriously though, I bet they could tax pet owners. There's already license fees in the US, right?",Curious to dive deeper
1080," Yes you have to license at least some pets, like dogs. Do you have any pets?",Neutral
1080," I recently moved and on my land there were two small kittens. I felt bad and fed them. Then more cats started coming around, but I don't want more than a few! lol They are barn cats, but come in sometimes.",Neutral
1080,So are they feral then?,Curious to dive deeper
1080," Yes, and some of them don't let me pet them, even. I'm going to have to take them to the local ASPCA to get them fixed so they don't have more kittens! I heard Theodore Roosevelt had a bear and a hyena for pets!",Neutral
1080,I wonder if animals like that can ever really be pets. It sounds a little bit more like a zoo.,Curious to dive deeper
1080," I don't know if they were the types of pets you can pet. I've seen people on TV shows that raise those types of animals and pet them, though. Do you like those animal shows?",Curious to dive deeper
1080," No, I don't really watch reality shows.",Neutral
1080," I used to watch some veterinary show. It was an older guy that was great with animals! I'm gonna go pet my cats now, or at least the nice ones! lol",Happy
1081," Hi, do you like animals?",Curious to dive deeper
1081," Hi there, I sure do, I think nature is amazing. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1081,I agree. I love nature. Did you know there are 20 quintillion animals on Earth?,Surprised
1081," Holy cow, that is insane, but I'm sure its way less than it was a couple hundred years ago. ",Curious to dive deeper
1081,I agree. Animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated.,Surprised
1081," Very interesting, so that is why, I never knew that. ",Curious to dive deeper
1081,I had no idea either. Germany became the first country to give animals constitutional rights.,Surprised
1081," It sounds like back in 2002, I wonder if other countries will eventually follow. ",Curious to dive deeper
1081,Hiccups are a holdover from early evolution when land animals had both gills and lungs.,Surprised
1081," That is true!  I remember learning about that back in school, so crazy!",Curious to dive deeper
1081,For sure. The loch ness monster is actually a protected species lol. Even though it may not even exist.,Surprised
1081," That is too funny, I don't think it does, I think people saw the Greenland shark and thought it was some weird creature. ",Curious to dive deeper
1081,I agree. The first cloned pet was a cat.,Surprised
1081," Interesting, wasn't the first cloned thing ever a sheep or something?",Curious to dive deeper
1081,It says it was a cat and they named it copy cat lol.,Surprised
1081,That is very clever lol.  What is crazy is that there are more pet tigers than wild ones in asia.,Curious to dive deeper
1081,I did not know that. Pretty crazy I agree. I would not want a pet tiger.,Surprised
1081," Heck no, what would you do with one?  I mean, it what are you trying to be Al Pacino in Scarface? lol",Curious to dive deeper
1081," HAHA. Roosevelt had over 20 pets, including a bear and a hyena.",Surprised
1081," That is just too nuts, both of those animals and I'm sure a bunch of the other ones just doesn't make sense to me. ",Curious to dive deeper
1081,I agree. It was good talking to you!,Happy
1082,Did you know the pilgrims clothing was full of color? I thought they wore dull colors,Curious to dive deeper
1082,I didn't know that.  They always show them in black when you see paintings of them,Surprised
1082," I know, right? They only wear black for special occasions. ",Surprised
1082," Sounds almost like what we do today for a lot of occasions, like formal events, black tie events, etc.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1082,Right. I found out there is a store in Alabama that only sells clothes and stuff from unclaimed baggage at airport. I want to see that!,Surprised
1082,That sounds like it could be very interesting.  Like shopping at a thrift store but more strange.  I can't imagine what that would even be like to experience,Curious to dive deeper
1082,Like a treasure hunt? Did you watch the Wonder woman movie? I guess that was the highest grossing superhero movie. Who knew?,Curious to dive deeper
1082," I didn't realize that.  I love that movie.  I thought it was very well done.  It is nice that they made a superhero movie with a woman as the main character and Wonder Woman was definitely the right one to choose.  I believe it has been in the works for a very long time, so I am glad they finally made it.",Happy
1082," I liked the movie, too. Gal Gadot, the wonder woman, actually served 2 years as a soldier in Israel. Another weird but cool fact. ",Curious to dive deeper
1082,I didn't realize that.  I think that could only add to the role.  She was great as Wonder Woman.,Curious to dive deeper
1082,She really was. And she thought she was auditioning for a cat woman role. She was a perfect Wonder woman in the movie.,Surprised
1082,I agree.  I can't imagine anyone else in that role.  I remember reading the comic book.  I can't believe she has been around in the comic book world since the 1940's,Surprised
1082,I was just informed that dogs are not color blind but just don't see as many colors as humans...how did they figure that out?,Curious to dive deeper
1082," I always wondered the same thing.  I think it has to do with understanding the rods and cones and how they work.  But I am not a scientist, just a dog lover",Curious to dive deeper
1082," So am I. I guess Google is a dog company, too. Their code of conducts states that they are a dog company...I find it funny.",Curious to dive deeper
1082,I want to work somewhere I can take my dog to work.  They are so beneficial to people in so many ways.  I think having them at work can also have a positive influence on employees.  I would be happier at work with a dog there.,Happy
1082," Yes, my friend used to work at a corporate office of Pets Mart and they were allowed to bring their dogs to work with them.",Neutral
1082," Wow, that's amazing.  I have a friend who trains service dogs.  It is amazing the tasks they can perform and the jobs they can be trained to do.  From police dogs, herding sheep, and actually assisting people with disabilities.",Happy
1082," Yes, my two dogs are just companion though...actually more like babies! In Istanbul there are vending machine of dog foods and water for strays",Happy
1082," Yeah, I heard about that.  People put plastic bottles in and dog food comes out for strays.  That is amazing.  I would feed plastic bottles into a machine all day to help an animal be fed.",Happy
1082," I think it's a good idea, too, but first they really should fix them so there won't be so many strays...",Curious to dive deeper
1082," Agreed, too many animals, not enough owners.",Neutral
1083,Did you know the pilgrims clothes were full of color.,Curious to dive deeper
1083,Yea I hear that Pilgrims only wore black for special occasions like thanksgiving I guess,Neutral
1083,Interesting. Do you like dogs?,Curious to dive deeper
1083," Yea I love dogs, it's so interested they are descended from domesticated wolves",Neutral
1083," Yeah, I didn't know that. Did you know that they have 12 blood types too? ",Curious to dive deeper
1083," No, thats insane dogs have that many blood types, it must be tough for dogs to donate dogs",Surprised
1083," Yeah, did you know they aren't actually color blind? ",Curious to dive deeper
1083," Yea, Dogs can see just as many colors as humans",Neutral
1083,Did you know that google prefers dogs to cats?,Curious to dive deeper
1083," Yea, Google must like dogs a lot if they put their preference in their official code of conduct",Neutral
1083," Yeah, they prefer them. Did you know Istanbul has vending machines releases food and water for stray dogs? ",Curious to dive deeper
1083," No, that's awesome, I hope there are vending machines that feed dogs somewhere in the US too",Neutral
1083,Interesting. Did you know that Apple had a clothing line in 1986?,Curious to dive deeper
1083," No, I wonder what the apple clothing looks like, I'm sure they are collectible items now",Curious to dive deeper
1083,I'm not sure. Probably not so great.,Curious to dive deeper
1083,I wonder if they sell nice looking clothes in the store in Alabama that sells items from unclaimed baggage,Curious to dive deeper
1083," Yeah, I'm not sure. Rip Curl makes clothes in North Korea, did you know that? ",Curious to dive deeper
1083," No, I wonder how Rip Curl is able to make clothes in North Korea due to all the sanctions against them",Curious to dive deeper
1083," I'm not sure, but they label them as if they are from China. ",Curious to dive deeper
1083," I know mislabeling the country of manufacture is illegal in the US, I wonder if Rip Curl has gotten in trouble for that",Neutral
1083," I'm not sure, but they do it. Nice chatting with you. ",Curious to dive deeper
1084," Hi, how are you?",Happy
1084,Not bad. Are you a fan of superhero movies?,Curious to dive deeper
1084,I am. What about you? What's your favorite?,Happy
1084,I love wonder woman. I think they did an amazing job portraying her. Have you seen it?,Curious to dive deeper
1084,I have and loved it too. I that Gadot was the perfect choice. Any famous person would have taken away from the role and placed it on them instead. Great casting.,Happy
1084,Fantastic casting. I love that she was actually a soldier. I think it lent a sense of realism to the role.,Happy
1084,Yeah. She did a great job! I also loved the scenes of her back on her homeland training. I thought it was really well done.,Happy
1084,I'm shocked that DC was able to snag the honor of highest grossing superhero origin movie. I would have thought Marvel would take that.,Surprised
1084,I agree. Maybe Marvel has saturated the market with all of their movies...,Surprised
1084,So true. I find it hilarious that they didn't even tell her what she was auditioning for. I wonder if that made her performance more authentic.,Curious to dive deeper
1084,Possibly. Or less stress! I would be so stressed auditioning for these parts...,Curious to dive deeper
1084,I can't even imagine it. Plus the pressure to release blockbusters in this day and age. If it doesn't make hundreds of millions you have had a flop.,Neutral
1084,I know. Can you imagine some of the great films of the past that would not be released because they studio might think it would flop?,Surprised

1084,So true. I think we are too hard on young stars. It can't be easy being in the limelight all the time.,Sad
1084,I agree. I think their parents need to pull the reins back a little for some of these youngsters. My daughter watches YouTube kids and they have like 7 year old stars on there!,Surprised
1084,Yeah but i think a lot of these parents are living out their dreams through their kids and that isn't right.,Angry

1088,I wonder if the world would be as interesting if people didn't tell lies.  Would we get bored?,Curious to dive deeper
1088," I think people would get bored, especially people who like to compete socially. How would they be able to keep up the excitement of doing things better than others.",Curious to dive deeper
1088," I guess if lies didn't hurt at times, it wouldn't be so bad to tell them, but they work a lot better in books and movies. ",Curious to dive deeper
1088," I agree, pretending to be someone or something you are not is alluring in the movies, but in real life, it is hard to keep up that kind of act. ",Neutral
1088,It's hard and exhausting.,Neutral
1088," That is so true. That is why I would much rather read about lying, than try to do it. Reading, can provide an escape, ya know. ",Neutral
1088,I guess that's why so many books are about lying. Instead of doing it you can read about it.,Curious to dive deeper
1088," I read a cool fact about reading. The world record for speed reading is 4,700 words per minute. Can you believe someone can do that? ",Surprised
1088,That's ridiculously fast.  I heard her name is Anne Jones.,Happy
1088,That is right. I can't imagine how much she had to practice to achieve that.,Surprised
1088,I wonder how good a person's comprehension is at that speed.,Happy
1088," I am not sure how the brain is even able to comprehend that many words in such a short time. I know when I read a lot my mind begins to wonder, I couldn't stay focused that long. ",Surprised

1088,Me too! I enjoy reading at a more leisurely pace though.,Neutral

1089," Hello, do you want to chat about guitars? I personally love guitars, I used to play back when I was in college.  My guitar was fretted and had six strings.",Curious to dive deeper
1089," I love guitars so great conversation topic, Im learning how to play them, cool sound",Curious to dive deeper
1089," Awesome, so yes, it is typically played with both hands by strumming or plucking the strings with either a guitar pick or fingers of one hand while simultaneously fretting with the fingers of the other hand.",Curious to dive deeper
1089,Do you have a favorite guitarist?,Curious to dive deeper
1089," Yes, Eddie Van Halen.  I saw him at concerts many times.  Did you know that when Eddie recorded the guitar solo for ""Beat It"" he literally set the studio speakers on fire? He is a wildman!",Curious to dive deeper
1089," I didnt know that, that's awesome, the level of skill of that guy, mine is Brian May",Curious to dive deeper
1089," Wow, another fantastic guitar player. He played for Queen, I believe and also had a PhD in Astrophysics.  Very cool.",Curious to dive deeper
1089," He does, not only a great guitarist but really smart, he made his own guitar in an unusual way",Curious to dive deeper
1089," Really?  I did know that as the guitarist for Queen uses coins, especially sixpence as guitar picks.",Curious to dive deeper
1089," He does? I guess his old fashioned, he is an interesting guy though",Curious to dive deeper
1089,I totally agree with that statement.  Did you also know that Matthew Bellamy from the band Muse holds the Guinness World Record for most guitars smashed on a tour?  Another wild guy.,Curious to dive deeper
1089," Thats crazy and poor guitars lol, I wouldnt trust my guitar around him that is a sure fact",Curious to dive deeper
1089,I never saw anyone at a concert smash a guitar so I'm not sure how I'd feel about that either.  I do know that Pink Floyd's guitarist turned a Grand houseboat on the river Thames into a floating recording studio call the Astoria.  That must have been awesome.,Curious to dive deeper
1089," Thats awesome, he must find a lot of peace out in the open sea",Curious to dive deeper
1089,Probably.  Most anything done by Pink Floyd has to be amazing.  Do you golf?,Curious to dive deeper
1089," Not really, I find the sport boring, do you like it?",Curious to dive deeper
1089,I took golfing in college twice and it was not that boring to actually play golf. It is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible. I actually like playing 18 holes better than miniature golf.,Curious to dive deeper
1089,Gold is a really popular sport theres even a golf course in Antarctica,Curious to dive deeper
1089,Did you know that Babe Ruth was once America's most famous golfer?  I guess he liked both golf and baseball.,Curious to dive deeper
1089," I didnt know that, talented athlete not only skilled in baseball but also a great golfer, he had a knack for sports I guess",Curious to dive deeper
1089," Yes, he was good at more than one thing. Nice chatting with you, have a good day.",Curious to dive deeper
1090,HI there... I am learning to play golf and guitar. Do you play?,Curious to dive deeper
1090," No, I don't play either, but they are interesting. I just can not believe how much water golf courses use. ",Surprised
1090," I know, right! I think they use about 312,000 gallons a day! America has  a bunch of courses, too.",Curious to dive deeper
1090," Yep, that's how much they use. The total space taken up in America by golf courses is more that the space of RI and Delaware combined.",Surprised
1090," Oh man! That is an amazing fact! I really want to visit a course in Dubai that requires 4,000,000 gallons a day. I can only imagine how pretty it must be. I think a famous baseball player was a golfer, Babe Ruth?",Curious to dive deeper
1090," That is way too much water if you ask me.Yes, I've heard that Babe Ruth at one time was America's most famous golfer.",Surprised
1090," Yeah, that is a good point the water seems excessive. Yeah, Babe Ruth and Samuel L. Jackson were both golfers. ",Curious to dive deeper
1090,I have heard that Jackson has it written into his move contracts to let him play golf two times a week.,Surprised
1090," That would be a super cool contract! He strikes me as a serious contract kinda guy. I was reading the other day that Wikileaks was publishing contracts that the government had that shows they were planning on destroying Wikileaks. Spy verse spy, sort of .",Curious to dive deeper
1090," Yeah, I'm sure he is a contract expert. LOL on the Wikileakes. Did you know the government owns 86% of the land in Nevada?",Surprised
1090," What! 86%? No, I had no idea but it makes sense they would keep it a semi secret. I want to hear about more countries that donate to things like the rainforest. I think Norway did that.",Surprised
1090,You are right. That was nice that they did that.,Happy
1090," Yeah, it sure was. They donated $1 billion dollars! Awesome number. ",Happy
1090," Yes, they did. Quite different from what the man in France did. He sold the Eiffel tower not just one time, but two!",Surprised
1090," HA, that would be a funny guy to know and listen to tell stories! I have been thinking September means golf, golf courses and sports clubs. I want a fitness routine that prevents me from overdoing it. ",Curious to dive deeper
1090,I'm sure he's fun. So do you play guitar? I really like Queen's Brian May. It's pretty amazing that he has a PHD in astrophysics.,Surprised
1090," Yeah, guitar is a good workout of the mind! I can barely spell astrophysics! Ya know Eddie Van Halen recorded the guitar solo for the song Beat it. The one song by Michael Jackson.",Curious to dive deeper
1090,Eddie actually set the studio speakers on fire during the recording!,Surprised
1090," No way, that is crazy and just as crazy as their music! I had read that Matthew Bellamy holds the record for the most smashed guitars.",Surprised
1090," Soubnds like he is a pretty crazy player, but I have not heard of him before.",Surprised
1090," Music world is so vast. I had a great time chatting with you, thank you so much.",Happy
1090,It was nice chatting with you too! Thanks.,Neutral
1091," Have you ever read a book with ""Lie"" in the title?",Curious to dive deeper
1091,I dont think so. Have you?,Happy
1091,I can't remember if I have.  I think the jist of it is books that have a great deal of deceit as part of the plot.,Angry
1091,That makes sense. I have just never been much of a reader. Unless you cont reading to my son before bed.,Happy
1091,That counts double!  Do you read him stuff about planets?  Like Jupiter's moon Ganymede is large enough to be considered a planet if it orbited the sun.,Curious to dive deeper
1091,Yeah we go to the library every week and pick out new books. He really likes cars and trains and stuff like that.,Happy
1091,Sound like a typical boy.  I have two sons.  They liked planets too and fun facts like Venus doesn't have any seasons.,Curious to dive deeper
1091,Thats interesting. We read the other day that Astronomers detected building blocks of life (atoms) in a planetary system 455 light years away. All little dude wanted to do after that was play with his legos. Lol.,Happy
1091,Legos are cool unless you step on them in the middle of the night barefooted. The are a quality product with only 18 out of 1000000 being bad.,Surprised
1091,Well anybody who has stepped on one in the middle of the night sure does know about that quality huh. They dont give any. I heard that lego is investing millions to switch away from oil based plastics. Its nice that they are going environmentally friendly.,Happy
1091," Yeah, since they make soooo many.  If they were divided among all the people in the world, each person would have 86 Lego bricks. ",Surprised
1091,Well we have a couple hundred peoples worth at my house then.,Happy
1091,LOL.  Has your son started reading? Iti is described as a complex interaction so be patient. if he's just starting :),Curious to dive deeper
1091,He doesnt read by himself yet just looks at the pictures. He is still young. Maybe one day he will break the speed reading record of 4700 words per minute. Thats reading pretty fast. Lol.,Happy
1091,I always wonder about how well these speed readers do in terms of reading comprehension.,Curious to dive deeper
1091,I would think they are tested pretty extensively on that aspect. It would be hard to put someone in the record book just based on them saying they read this many pages.,Happy
1091,Maybe so... It may be controversial like in the 18th century when there was a moral panic because the reading of novels was becoming popular.  They should see what we're up to now.,Angry
1091,I think thats just how the world works. People panic about what they dont understand. Then it becomes main stream and they forgot that they even panicked.,Happy
1091,Agree.  I wonder if anyone panicked when it was discovered that Uranus rotates on its side unlike the other planets?,Surprised
1091," Im sure there is some astronomer out there that was thinking this has to be the end, we better warn everybody. Lol.",Happy
1091,Lol.  Best of luck to you and you're little dud.  You were and excellent chat partner!,Neutral
1092,I didn't realize the large asteroids were ever classified as planets. I never saw them included in a list of planets before 2006.,Surprised
1092,Had no idea. Makes me wonder if Pluto is still a planet,Curious to dive deeper
1092," I'm pretty sure it was downgraded, but if I recall correctly it has been restored since.",Curious to dive deeper
1092,Good! I see that every other planet could fit between the earth and moon. We must have some really big planets.,Curious to dive deeper
1092,Jupiter's got about ten times earth's diameter.,Neutral
1092,Wow. That's really massive.,Curious to dive deeper
1092,Yeah. I also think Legos are cool. Modular design is a really efficient way of doing things.,Happy
1092,I see they are also the world's largest tire manufacturer for their mini wheels haha,Surprised
1092,Interesting. I'd like to know more about that parts ecology and whether they're standardized to fit a lot of different vehicles.,Curious to dive deeper
1092," I hear just about all legos fit all other sets, as they manufactured with some serious precision.",Curious to dive deeper
1092," Yeah, I meant the mini-wheels in particular. That whole modular thing is a great way to beat planned obsolescence. PC hardware operates on the same principle.",Neutral
1092,Exactly. And people really appreciate that.,Surprised
1092," There's an open-source hardware outfit called Open Source Ecology that builds a whole collection of tabletop machine tools -- drill presses, lathes, routers, 3D printers, etc. -- with a lot of interchangeable parts like power supplies, that can reproduced with their own machinery.",Happy
1092,Sweet. Could that be used for legos?,Curious to dive deeper
1092," I'm sure the 3D printer could be used for legos, or for anything that an industrial extruder is used for.",Happy
1092," Would need to be faster though I would imagine. And obviously many, many of them.",Curious to dive deeper
1092," Yeah, I don't know how practical or cost-effective it would be -- probably prototyping the mold with the printer and then using the mold to make multiple copies would be faster.",Curious to dive deeper
1092,Sounds about right. I was not aware that silently reading only started recently.,Curious to dive deeper
1092,I vaguely recall learning that in the past -- people read out loud even to themselves. Must've been annoying with multiple people trying to read.,Neutral
1092,Good way to learn how to remain undistracted,Curious to dive deeper
1092," I don't think I could do it, LOL. I'm bad at multi-tasking. Welp, it's been nice talking to you!",Neutral
1092,You too,Happy
1093,Did you know that Lego's were invented in Denmark?  I loved to play with Legos as a kid.,Happy
1093," Hello there, no I didn't know that, I used to as well.  I remember when we bought this giant mix carboard tub full of legos for $20, I was the happiest ever. ",Curious to dive deeper
1093,Do you prefer to build pre-designed Lego kits or to make up your own design?,Happy
1093," I liked them both, but probably the own design since I didn't get a whole lot of new ones with the instructions. How about yourself?",Curious to dive deeper
1093," I love to follow the directions of large assemblies, but they are too expensive to do very much.  But it is a fun thing to do with my nephew.",Happy
1093,Yeah my nephews are into legos as well.  But actually they are all into Pokemon I guess.,Curious to dive deeper
1093," I LOVE Pokemon.  We play all the time - cards, video game, Pokemon GO.  What sort of Pokemon do your nephews like to play?",Surprised
1093," They really like collecting the cards.  I guess it's all about opening new packs to see what you get, that is the most exciting. ",Curious to dive deeper
1093,That is a great part of it!  Have you ever played Pokemon GO on a phone?,Happy
1093," No I haven't, but I can remember recently when that became a craze again. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1093," It is a lot of fun! And so crazy to use the augmented reality feature and see the Pokemon ""in real life"".  Do you use any virtual reality types of gear?",Happy
1093," No, I have tried it once, but I have a bit of a problem with motion sickness so I didn't care for it too much, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1093," I can understand that.  We don't have any VR games, but I think that the ""virtual"" rides at amusement parks are pretty similar.  They use technology to move your seats and visually trick you into thinking that you're really moving.",Happy
1093," Yeah I think you are right, I wonder if they have any VR experience for astronomy, like going out on the moon or something. ",Curious to dive deeper
1093," That sure would be a cheaper way to experience space travel, wouldn't it?  At least for tourists.",Neutral
1093," Yeah, imagine if they did had the technology to do a VR thing on other planets, like flying around Jupiter or something. ",Curious to dive deeper
1093," That would be awesome.  I wonder if we know enough about other planets through exploration and satallites to do an accurate job with VR, or whether it would all just be made up.",Neutral
1093," Yeah that's what I mean, it would be cool if they could make it accurate. Did you know Venus is the only planet that rotates clock-wise?",Curious to dive deeper
1093,I read that. It is amazing how different from Earth even our closest planetary neighbors are.  Would you ever consider going to Mars?,Neutral
1093," Yeah that is very interesting as well.  No, I don't have any desire to travel that far, I'd take a vacation to Florida or something though. ",Curious to dive deeper
1093,That would be lovely.  Have a great day.,Neutral
1094,do you like dogs?,Curious to dive deeper
1094,I love dogs. Did you know they have 12 blood types?,Curious to dive deeper
1094,Yeah and there are blood drives where they can donate blood,Curious to dive deeper
1094,Yeah so cool. Do you know how they are feeding stray dogs in Istanbul now?,Curious to dive deeper
1094,yes they have a machine that dispenses food and water when you feed it plastic bottles,Curious to dive deeper
1094," such a great idea, for the dogs and the environment as well",Curious to dive deeper
1094,true. do you know they can understand pointing,Curious to dive deeper
1094,yes and elephants have the ability to understand that as well,Curious to dive deeper
1094,Yeah pretty smart both creatures. Are you a dog or cat person?,Curious to dive deeper
1094,I am a dog person just as Google the company is,Curious to dive deeper
1094,yeah they have it even in their code of conduct that they are a dog company,Curious to dive deeper
1094,yeah. Did you know they are not colorblind as we think they are?,Curious to dive deeper
1094,yeah they just see less colors than we do,Curious to dive deeper
1094,Yeah. DO you like fish?,Curious to dive deeper
1094,I love fish too. Have you heard of the species called the black swallower,Curious to dive deeper
1094,Yes they can eat prey that is twice their size,Curious to dive deeper
1094,Pretty scary. Do you know how freshwater fish get their water?,Curious to dive deeper
1094,Yes they get it through their skin via osmosis?,Curious to dive deeper
1094," yeah, how about saltwater fish?",Curious to dive deeper
1094," They get it through their mouths, quite cool",Curious to dive deeper
1094," It sure is, so many different adaptations",Curious to dive deeper
1095,Hey how are you? Think it's time we get rid of those pesky royal families?,Curious to dive deeper
1095,Yeah haha Do you like dogs?  I just found out they have 12 different blood types.,Curious to dive deeper
1095," Dogs are the best thing ever, they're basically the modern wolves of today but a different, domensticated species. You have a dog?",Curious to dive deeper
1095," Yes,  I do have a dog.  I agree,  best thing everrrr!  Dogs and elephants understand pointing.  Do you have any dogs?",Curious to dive deeper
1095," I have a dog, they are the best thing ever. I wonder why dogs and elephants understand pointing over any other animal?",Curious to dive deeper
1095,Good question i have no idea.  I recently found out dogs are not colorblind though.,Curious to dive deeper
1095," For sure, they just don't see as many colors as us. Would you rather fight 10 dog sized elephants or 1 elephant sized dog?",Curious to dive deeper
1095," Wow this turned into a ""would you rather"" game sweet lol I think I would go with 1 elephant sized dog,  how about you?  Those are both kinda scary though lol ",Curious to dive deeper
1095," I'm not sure, it'd be like fighting Clifford the big Red dog. I'm not sure, I would rather not fight a dog, they're so cool. Did you see the seahorse is the only fish with a neck?",Curious to dive deeper
1095," So you would fight 10 elephants?  Elephants are cool too.  I figured I could just play with the dog so he or she forgets we are fighting hahaha  I did,  I love sea animals too really cool,  I wonder why they need a neck though.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1095,I don't know if elephants can bite can they? It'd be a pretty funny battle in my opinion. An elephant sized dog that just wants to play and cuddle would be so much fun lol.,Curious to dive deeper
1095," Right!  I dont think elephants bit,  but they are a power house when they start running,  even as a dog sized one lol ",Curious to dive deeper
1095," For sure, what about horses, Clint Eastwood was allergic to horses, that is his Gran Turino apparently.",Curious to dive deeper
1095," That is interesting,  since hes in so many westerns.  Did you know theres a breed of jellyfish and lobster that is immortal?",Curious to dive deeper
1095," I did not know that. I have another fight for you, 100 duck sized horses or 1 horse sized ducks, who would you rather fight?",Curious to dive deeper
1095," 100?  Geez,  lol I will still go with just the 1 horse sized duck.  I cant handle 100 lol",Curious to dive deeper
1095," a 1500 pound duck would be so terrifying lol, the horse sized ducks would be rowdy but so cute lol",Surprised
1095," It would be adorable,  but im pretty sure I would lose either of those fights lol I might be able to run away from the horse sized duck because it waddles lol ",Curious to dive deeper
1095," I'd most definitely lose, especially if the horse was referred to as the Equus Ferus lol.",Curious to dive deeper
1095," Can you imagine commuting on a horse,  some school kids took horses to school,  and got suspended lol ",Curious to dive deeper
1095," Oh man, it's probably better for the environment though right? Great chatting with you though, I hope you have a great rest of the night!",Curious to dive deeper
1096,Hi! Are you a dog lover?,Happy
1096," Yes, I really like dogs, though I don't own one. You?",Neutral
1096,I have an esquisite Canis lupus: A white German shepherd dog. Great animal!,Happy
1096," Wow, sounds beautiful! Smart dog? Well trained?",Neutral
1096," Absolutely!  Runs rings around other breeds I have owned. Literally. The dog is non stop motion.  You know, they say dogs and elephants are the only animals that instinctively understand pointing, and it is true! My dog points at her dish when she wants me to fill it!",Happy
1096,Does she pick it up in her mouth and throw it angrily when you're late with dinner? LOL I've seen dogs do that. They get so indignant!,Neutral
1096," Different breed of animal, those kind of dogs. LOL  I'll have to get her to Google that later. Google loves dogs, and dogs apparently love Google!",Happy
1096," Google is great. I think dogs are calming and fun in an office. Cats, not so much. Too finicky.",Neutral
1096," Cats are good if you like the kind of animal that looks at you and thinks, ""If I was big enough, I would eat you...""  I find fish to be more calming than cats.  Nothing like a nice gill-bearing aquatic craniate floating in a pool of stagnant water to add a touch of class to the office! ",Happy
1096," True! They still have the mindset of their predator forebears. I figure cats are independent. If people want pets like that, cats are great. ",Neutral
1096,In Istanbul they have vending machines filled with dog food. Worst trail mix I ever had!,Happy
1096," LOL. Well, it wasn't designed for tourists! I guess you learned your lesson. Still, thanks for helping keep Istanbul clean!",Neutral
1096," I didn't see the label on the container until too late. I guess I am a bit blind. Some people think dogs are color blind, but it's not true. They are just programmed to see fewer colors than we are.",Happy
1096," They have good ears and noses, so I guess they don't need color as much as we do.",Neutral
1096," Yeah, and they can even thrive on a starch-rich diet. I know this because my dog eats every potato chip I drop!",Happy
1096," Well, your dog can't help. I would the chips off the floor too! They're CHIPS. Can't go to waste.",Neutral
1096,5 second rule doesn't work in our house.  The dog is too quick!  It must be in her blood. You know dogs have 12 different blood types? They will eat even more!,Happy
1096,They have blood drives too. I would reward the pooches with potato chips. And not from the floor neither!,Neutral
1096," You might be the next dog whisperer!  Dogs can fill the role of a human in hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and in helping the disabled. That is more than most of the people I know! ",Happy
1096," We don't deserve dogs. Anyway, thanks for the chat! Enjoy your dog!",Neutral
1096," I will thank you. And when the time is right, consider getting a white GSD!",Happy
1097," Hi, how are you tonight? Do you like animals?",Neutral
1097,Good. Yes I do. I always had pets. I had a seahorse in my tank growing up. Did you know it is the only fish that has  a neck.,Surprised
1097,You had a pet seahorse? Cool! Did you ever have a pet dog?,Curious to dive deeper
1097,I did. I had quite a few. My girls have 2 cats now.,Curious to dive deeper
1097,Did you know your dogs' blood types? Do most owners?,Curious to dive deeper
1097,No but I did have a dalmatian named spot growing up. I was surprised to find out the reason they are associated with fireman was because they protect horses. Im not seeing the connection.,Curious to dive deeper
1097," I think Dalmatians are often deaf, so they are not bothered by the sirens. In the old days they used horses, which would get spooked by the noise and flames, I guess.",Neutral
1097,And what is funny is Clint Eastwood who has done a million movies with horses became allergic to them later in life. I get it though my daughter got allergies at 18 from stuff she ate her whole life.,Surprised
1097,That's strange. i wonder what causes the body to do that. IDid you hear about the two high school students who rode their horses to school on 'no vehicles to school day'?,Neutral
1097,That must have made the school mad. Here in Florida people ride horses everywhere.,Surprised
1097,They don't spook around vehicles? That's good. You don't have a horse do you? Seems expensive.,Neutral
1097," No, but my daughter has a friend that has like 10 and it is very expensive.",Surprised
1097,None of them are Lipizzaners I suppose.,Neutral
1097," No, that would be cool. I like that it takes about 6 years for them to turn completely white.",Curious to dive deeper
1097,I guess those horses require special training. I've never seen them. I think they're in Austria.,Neutral
1097,I don't know. Did you know that the black swallower fish could eat prey twice its length and ten times its weight. It must have a big mouth.,Surprised
1097," And a gut that expands tremendously. After it eats, what does it do? Binge on Netflix?",Curious to dive deeper
1097,Funny. I think its strange that Google prefers dogs to cats and they have it specifically written in their code of conduct. What if you do not like dogs can you not work for them?,Surprised
1097," Sure, just don't bring your cat! It must be tough if people are allergic to dogs.",Neutral
1097,That's what I was thinking.,Surprised
1097," Well, I enjoyed chatting with you! Have a good night! ",Happy
1097,You too. Goodnight,Surprised
1097,Bye!,Happy
1097,Bye,Surprised
1097,Enjoy your pets!,Happy
1097,You too.,Surprised
1097,Make sure to hit the DONE button,Neutral
1097,I am not getting one,Surprised
1097,It's just after the SEND button. It should become active after 10 turns.,Neutral
1097,it just came up. Goodnight.,Surprised
1097,See ya!,Neutral
1097,bye,Surprised
1098," How's it going, do you know there are over 1.5 million living animal species?",Curious to dive deeper
1098," No, I didn't know that. This includes fish?",Curious to dive deeper
1098," Yea, speaking of which hiccups are an evoulutionary holdover from when land animals had both lungs and gills",Neutral
1098,Interesting. I didn't know that. Do you think that is true?,Curious to dive deeper
1098," It's possible, the 2 hypothesis are a holdover from having gills or something to do to help babies breath when they are nursing",Neutral
1098," Hmm, I'm not buying into it. Did you know that Germany gave animals constitutional rights? ",Curious to dive deeper
1098," No but that's pretty cool that Germany gave them some rights, animals do need to be protected from mistreatment in many situations",Neutral
1098,What do you think of Computers?,Curious to dive deeper
1098,It's amazing how far they have come from the 1mb of ram that was able to run the space shuttle's computer,Surprised
1098," Yeah, that is pretty crazy, but perhaps the systems aren't all that complex. ",Curious to dive deeper
1098," I guess not, computer can be pretty simple like the won Russians invented that runs on water",Neutral
1098," Yeah, technically our power comes from water if you think about it. ",Curious to dive deeper
1098," Yea, I wonder if the transhumanists will succesfully upload their mind to computers one day",Curious to dive deeper
1098," I would do it, that is for sure. ",Curious to dive deeper
1098,I wonder if minds uploaded to computers could be hacked,Curious to dive deeper
1098," Yeah, that is an interesting question. Did you know that smoking near an apple computer voids its warranty? ",Curious to dive deeper
1098," No, sounds suspect that smoking would turn an apple computer into a biohazard",Neutral
1098,I wonder if the same policy is in place for iPhones?,Curious to dive deeper
1098," It's possible, I know the iphones have moisture detectors in them, I wouldn't put it past apple to have some sort of smoke detector in there",Angry
1098," Yeah, that is true. I forgot about that. I've actually dropped my phone in the sink, it still works. Well, nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
1098,Have a good one,Neutral
1099,do you like animals?,Curious to dive deeper
1099,love them . do you know how many individual ones are out there?,Curious to dive deeper
1099,Yes there are about 20 quintollion out there,Curious to dive deeper
1099,Yeah. Do you have a pet?,Curious to dive deeper
1099,I do not but OI hear they develop white patches when domesticated,Curious to dive deeper
1099,I have two dogs but have not noticed that,Curious to dive deeper
1099,Oh I see. Do you know in Germany animal rights are protected by the constitution,Curious to dive deeper
1099,I think we should have something like that here too,Curious to dive deeper
1099,I agree. Do you know why we have hiccups?,Curious to dive deeper
1099,Yes a holdover from when ancestors had gills and lungs at the same time,Curious to dive deeper
1099,Yeah. Did you know the Loch Ness monster is a protected species?,Curious to dive deeper
1099,Yes under the animal rights act in Scotland,Curious to dive deeper
1099,Yeah pretty cool. Did you know we lost our hair less that a quarter million years ago?,Curious to dive deeper
1099,Yeah pretty recent . Do you know why we are good persistent runners?,Curious to dive deeper
1099,Yes because we used to be hunters and that came in handy,Curious to dive deeper
1099,Yeah. Did you know we are the only ones that cannot synthesize vitamin c?,Curious to dive deeper
1099,Yes other animals have the enzyme that does that and we do not,Curious to dive deeper
1099,Yeah. There is a frequency of sound that scares us,Curious to dive deeper
1099," I wonder what that sounds like, out of curiosity",Curious to dive deeper
1099,Yeah. Nice chat today,Curious to dive deeper
1099,Same here,Happy
1100,Good morning!  I heard something interesting the other day.  Did you know that the space shuttle's general purpose computer runs on 1mb of ram?,Neutral
1100,Wow that's kind of scary lol. I did not know that. Do you like animals?,Curious to dive deeper
1100,I love animals!  I'm curious to see what all is out there.  Experts say that while over 1.5 million of them have been identified there are an estimate of over 7 million different species on the planet!,Neutral
1100,Me too. That's a lot of species! I saw there are over 20 quintillion animals on Earth.,Surprised
1100,That' s really amazing isn't it?  Have you heard about Germany putting in their constitution that animals have legal rights?,Neutral
1100,I did not see that. I do like that idea though. I think animals need to be protected more.,Surprised
1100,Germany is apparently the first country on the planet to do it.  They did it back in 2002.,Neutral
1100,Interesting. I saw animals get white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated.,Surprised
1100," Hmm, I wonder why.  Have you heard about Scotland protecting the loch ness monster?",Neutral
1100,I did see that. We don't even know if it is even real lol.,Surprised
1100,I guess they decided back in 1912 to protect it just in case it is ever proven to exist.,Neutral
1100,That's pretty cool. Hiccups are from back when land animals had both lungs and gills.,Surprised
1100,Yeah?  I had no idea animals ever had both.,Neutral
1100,Me either. I would love to have gills. How cool would that be?,Surprised
1100,It would definitely make swimming and scuba diving a ton easier!,Neutral
1100," For sure lol. Did you know humans lost their body hair around 240,000 years ago?",Surprised
1100,No i didn't know that.  So we had more body hair back in the day?,Neutral
1100,I guess so lol. There is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans.,Surprised
1100,That's weird and a little uncomfortable.  Do you think military organizations use it?,Neutral
1100,They might. I think it would be good to use in horror films if they can do that.,Curious to dive deeper
1100," Definitely! It would make the audiences so much more freaked out!  Well, it looks like I have to go now.  It's been great chatting with you!  Have a great day!",Neutral
1101,I adore animals. Are you an animal lover?,Curious to dive deeper
1101," Good morning, yes I love animals and I am against any use of animals experiments. ",Curious to dive deeper
1101,I am as well. I will help any animal I can. Did you know that there are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth?!,Surprised
1101," No I never knew the number was that high, wow!! Have you heard that the loch ness monster is a protected species in Scotland? ",Curious to dive deeper
1101," I had not but that is just silly ha ha. I can't imagine who thought that was necessary and how it made it through lawmakers. In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights. In my opinion we need a lot more of that type of legislation. ",Happy
1101," Yes I remember when Germany did that and I agree more of that is needed. I wish it would happen. Gee, I never knew that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated.   ",Curious to dive deeper
1101,I was not aware of that. I wonder why? I cant see any evolutionary reason for it.,Curious to dive deeper
1101,I wonder why as well and will have to research that more. I do not see any reason for it either. I was also not aware that hiccups are left over from when land animals had both gills and lungs.,Surprised
1101," I was not either. I wish it would go away now because they are quite annoying ha ha. In contrast to animals, humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago. ",Curious to dive deeper
1101," LOL, they certainly are annoying. That is very interesting and did you know that there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans? ",Curious to dive deeper
1101," I did not but I know that certain pitches (usually high ones) make me jumpy so I suppose that makes sense. Almost all animals and plants synthesize their own Vitamin C, but humans cannot because the gene for this enzyme is defective. I wonder why we did not evolve to have that ability as well?",Curious to dive deeper
1101,I was wondering that as well when I heard about that. It would be a lot healthier if we did have the ability to do so.  I have known some fast runners but I did not know humans were adapted for this for hunting reason. I hate hunting but I guess primitive man needed to do so.,Curious to dive deeper
1101,I couldn't do it myself but I suppose it is necessary. But it would crush me. Large cats certainly seem super adept at hunting.,Curious to dive deeper
1101,I wonder how the russians made a computer that ran on water in 1936,Curious to dive deeper
1101,I was not aware that they did. I'm not sure how that is possible. I'm assuming it would have been extremely limited in it's abilities. The space shuttle's general purpose computer runs on 1mb of ram. That blows my mind especially with as much data as we can hold on just a flash stick or SD card now.,Surprised
1101,I find that hard to believe. Very interesting. I did not know that smoking near apple computers voids the warranty by making it a biohazard.,Surprised
1101,I did not know that either. I don't know why it would be a biohazard but I understand it voiding the warranty because the nicotine would gum up the internal parts. Someone built a working 16-bit computer using nothing but the basic minecraft building blocks. It's amazing how far we have come!,Surprised
1101," It truly is amazing. Well transhumanists want to upload their minds to memory sticks and computers, that is certainly interesting. ",Curious to dive deeper
1101,I think we are a long way from that technology. They sure have covered that concept several times on the series Black Mirror.,Curious to dive deeper
1101," It sure has been. To think all the technology we have and yet they still experiment on animals in useless, archaic and unnecessary experiments. RH monkeys are such an abused group. ",Curious to dive deeper
1101,I agree. I do not like these practices either. The study of animals is called zoology. I think that would be a fascinating field to work in.,Curious to dive deeper
1101,I think so too and I have wished I had done so when I was younger. Animals are so very interesting.,Neutral
1101,I agree. There are an estimated 7 million animal species in total. That's a lot of animals to study.,Curious to dive deeper
1101,Yes and they do find new ones sometimes as well. It is a large field to study.,Neutral
1101,It certainly is. Around 1 million alone are just insects.,Surprised
1101,Amazing. Well it has been nice speaking with you about such an interesting topic.,Neutral
1101,You as well.,Neutral
1102,Do you ever shop at Macy's?,Curious to dive deeper
1102," Hello, no we do not have one here.  You?",Curious to dive deeper
1102,yes i do sometimes but the one I go to is kind of far away,Neutral
1102," Macy's said it boosted sales by dialing back discounts, adding exclusive products and investing in its private-label brands.",Happy
1102," it seems like they are doing much better than other department stores, for example, Sears",Neutral
1102," Yes, Sears got behind the curve and felt the decline quickly.",Curious to dive deeper
1102,they sure did! What do you think about the store in Alabama that only sells stuff from unclaimed baggage?,Neutral
1102,That's crazy to think.  I've had luggage lost at the airport before though.,Sad
1102," me too, i wonder how long it sits before the store gets it?",Neutral
1102,I'm not sure.  Seems like there would be constant issues.  United states postal service has a contract with amazon to deliver your packages on sunday.,Surprised
1102," i know, i always wondered why we got them on sundays and now i know! Do you use amazon?",Neutral
1102," Yes, I do.  Amazon warehouse workers walk between 7 and 15 miles each day as part of their daily shift",Curious to dive deeper
1102,did you see that the ceo built a clock into a mountain. I wonder what prompted him to do that?,Curious to dive deeper
1102,That dude is filthy rich.,Happy
1102,do you have any clue where it could be? Like geographical region?,Neutral
1102," No, I'm not sure.  Amazon is in Seattle, Washington so it may be close to that.",Curious to dive deeper
1102,you're right maybe that was it. did you know imbd was owned by amazon?,Neutral
1102,I did see that and didn't realize that.,Surprised
1102,i didn't realize that either. it is also hard to believe the company is just 15 years old!,Neutral
1102,The first amazon.com customer spent $27.95 and got a building named after him,Happy
1102,what a lucky guy! i moreso wonder what he bought lol,Curious to dive deeper
1103,What do you think about Drake?,Curious to dive deeper
1103,I don't know anything about him but I do have a few rap-like songs.,Angry
1103,That's an interesting perspective. Did you know that Tupac's music is considered culturally significant by the Library of Congress?,Curious to dive deeper
1103,I do know that Eminem's dream was to become a comic book artist. I don't think that would have become as lucrative.,Angry
1103," No, at least not in the age of digital music and YouTube. With Netflix, it makes up half of peak internet traffic in North America!",Curious to dive deeper
1103," I can believe that.  Video, particularly HD and more, eat up bandwidth fast.  I bet they are constantly upgrading like Psy had to...",Neutral
1103,I imagine that they have vast server farms to host all of that data. It can't hurt that they have access to Google's IT infrastructure since they were purchased by them in 2006.,Curious to dive deeper
1103,It's more about how many Mps they can push... They need to since YouTube is the 2nd largest search engine on the net.,Curious to dive deeper
1103," Yes, the bandwidth required makes the whole net neutrality issue so interesting. Imagine if ISPs didn't just prefer certain content providers, but preferred certain types of actual content as well! It would be like censorship.",Curious to dive deeper
1103,Giving the gov't any control over the internet is beyond stupid.  I think it's cool that Busta Rhymes did the voice of the Reptar Wagon in the 1998 Rugrats movie.,Disgusted
1103," Yes, crossovers between art forms can broaden audiences and bring about conversations. The phrase ""rap"" began as a term meaning to converse in the African American lexicon of the 1960s, so it's great to see it can bring about conversations between cultures and people these days.",Neutral
1103," Yep, Korean rappers developed a new form of freestyle rap called ""Compliment Battle.""  I think rap is banned in N. Korea. ",Surprised
1103," Haha, I bet Gangnam Style is banned there, too. It's not like regular citizens have access to non-state media there, anyway. There censorship of culture in general would prevent rap from developing.",Neutral
1103," I think it's funny that in 2001, a Michigan judge delivered her ruling with rap.  ",Surprised
1103,I don't think that was very professional.,Neutral
1103," Did you know that cops have their own YouTube called ""BluTube""?  If it contains videos of arrests, I could see that blowing up on them. ",Curious to dive deeper
1103," Yes, it could be even worse if they post rap battles that they get involved in. That would get a lot of dis-likes in public opinion, maybe even as many as the most disliked video on YouTub, Justin Bieber's ""Baby.""",Neutral
1103,Poor Justine.  Maybe he should have become a comic book artist.,Angry
1103," Well, he does have plenty of illustrations on his body nowadays--probably trying to imitate rappers that he admires! Maybe he also admires comic book heroes the way Eminem does and could add a Spiderman tattoo.",Neutral
1103," I didn't realize Drake was so young, only graudating HS in 2012.",Surprised
1103,I think that's indicative of the fact the he was a child actor and just took a long time to finish-he was born in 1986.,Neutral
1103," The precursor to rap is a West African griot tradition.  SO long, nice chat!",Angry
1104,Hi! Are you a fan of the Canadian rapper Drake? I am and can't believe he graduated high school at 25. That is crazy!,Surprised
1104,Good morning! How do you like rap? I am not really a fan so I don't know much about it.,Neutral
1104," I like rap for the most part. Always loved Tupac. In fact, his music is actually in the library of Congress of cultural significance!",Neutral
1104,I don't know any of them except M and M. I kinda like his stuff. I can't believe anyone graduated from high school at 25! That's funny.,Curious to dive deeper
1104," Agreed. It is surprising. Did you know Eminem actually wanted 5o be a comic book artist growing up, befoee becoming a rapper? In fact, his favorite character was Spider-Man!",Neutral
1104,I did read that somewhere. He is probably a better rapper than artist.,Neutral
1104," Yeah, true. I bet he's glad he became a rapper anyway. I'm sure he makes much more money than he would as a comic book artist. Speaking if Eminem, I can't believe that judge in Michigan gave her ruling in a rap during the suit filed against Eminem. That's hilarious!",Happy
1104,I think that shows that some judges have a sense of humor. Sometimes you wonder whether they are human or not. I did see Psy on Youtube and thought that he was really good. I didn't realize that was rap.,Neutral
1104,Agreed. It did sort if humanize judges. Ha! Did you also see Justin Beiber's song Baby on YouTube? It's actually the most disliked song on the site!,Neutral
1104,I do not like Justin Bieber.  I like Youtube to find relaxing music for my cats. They seem to like Brahm's lullaby. I don't think they like rap!,Curious to dive deeper
1104," That's awesome! Hey, if they ever want to see a good site with cop videos, the police have their own version of YouTube that's called Blutube.",Neutral
1104,I think Youtube is very useful. I like TED talks and used them in school a lot. You can fins almost anything on it including how to cook a recipe. I sometimes like to see how something is done-like home repairs. It's good for that too.,Neutral
1104," So true! It is the second largest search engine on the net, so you can find just about anything you need, especially for schooling!",Neutral
1104,The only thing is that Youtube and Netflix take up so much bandwidth that my Roku gets slow around 4-7 PM. I should probably buy a booster.,Neutral
1104," I can understand that. YouTube and Netflix both account for half the peak internet traffic in north America, unfortunately. ",Sad
1104,When I was a kid we didn't have it. We went outside to play. The rule was you had to come in as soon as the street lights went on because kids didn't have cell phones with clocks.,Neutral
1104,Oh wow! Yeah it seems a lot has changed over the years! A lot of kids now like to watch YouTube it seems. Luckily videos that are inappropriate for minors are only available to users who affirm to be at least 18.,Neutral
1104," But no one pays attention to that rule, I bet. I always feel that fresh air and friends are better than any technology when you're growing up, anyway.",Neutral
1104," That is so true! I agree 100%! Although I bet when those three guys who were fired from PayPal started YouTube  back in February of 2005, they never expected it to become what it is - especially since Google purchased it a year after they started it. ",Neutral
1104," Yes, a lot of people have made a fortune with all of this new technology and one good thing about it is that you can keep in touch with your kids all the time. The world is not as safe as it used to be for children. You have to have vision to see ahead far enough to make so much money on something like Google.",Curious to dive deeper
1104," You are right! And it's crazy it was purchased for $1.65 billion almost a year after it was started. Wish I had thought of that back then! Ha! Speaking of YouTube, I need to go listen to Timmy Thomas' 1972 song ""Why we can't live together"" since Drake actually sampled that song for the beat of his ""Hotline Bling! It was great chatting with you today! Have a good one!",Happy
1105,Did you know that Drake is Canadian?,Neutral
1105,I did not know that.  All I knew is that he is a musician.,Neutral
1105," He is multi-talented, A rapper, singer, song writer, record producer, actor and more.",Neutral
1105,Wow.  He is doing well for being so young - he graduated high school at age 25 in 2012.,Neutral
1105,That is a little late to graduate HS.  But he was in a teen drama on TV so he probably did not give much time to studying.,Neutral
1105,Yes  he was touring in 2011 - where he spent a lot of money on children's classic books.,Neutral
1105," His first fame was from that TV teen drama, called Degrassi.",Neutral
1105,That is cool.  I know he released his first album in 2010 which debuted at #1,Neutral
1105," I was not aware of that back then.  That album was ""Thank Me Later""  I like it to be able to say a rapper's album name with cursing.",Neutral
1105,Yes.  Many rap artists are rather obscene.  He had two mixtapes in 2015 which earned platinum,Neutral
1105,Apparently Kanye recognized Drake's excellence when listening to Drake's song caused Kanye to spend some time rewriting his own song.,Neutral
1105,That is really cool.  He got quadruple platinum status in streaming music.,Neutral
1105,I love it that I can look up about any musician on YouTube and hear him or her.  Google owns YouTube now.,Neutral
1105," Absolutely, I check out artists playing locally like that all the time.  400 hours of content are uploaded to youtube each minute!",Surprised
1105,Wow.  That's a lot of memory for them to store that.  It is the second largest search engine on the internet,Surprised
1105,Yes its insane.  A billion hours of content are watched every day!,Surprised
1105,Yes!  Netflix and YouTube account for half of the internet peak traffic usage.,Neutral
1105,I just heard that police actually have their own youtube called bluetube!,Surprised
1105,That is a cute play on words.  You have to be a registered user to upload a video.  I have never done that.,Neutral
1105,I have uploaded a bunch of videos.  Luckily none of mine are disliked as much as Justin Bieber's baby,Neutral
1105,I hope you made some money with your views.  Nice talking with you.,Neutral
1106," Hello, do you like to go shopping?",Happy
1106," Yes. Best local dept. store is Macy's. Pricey sometimes, but great sales, too! You?",Curious to dive deeper
1106,Exactly! I love shopping at Macy's and i'm glad others are starting to feel the same way!,Happy
1106," Agreed. Sure, I can order online, but I prefer to try clothes on! Only 60% ever feel and look - right. You know?",Curious to dive deeper
1106," Yep, i like to try on my clothes you never know how they will fit even from Macy's.",Happy
1106," Exactly, but they've scaled up their merchandise quality of late, which can mean better fit & much longer wear! Do you mostly shop for clothes there?",Curious to dive deeper
1106,Thnat's good to hear! I do! Especially around Christmas time too!,Happy
1106," Right. Jeff Bezos' Amazon may take over as the largest US apparel seller, but maybe not...What do you think?",Curious to dive deeper
1106,I wouldn't doubt that Amazon would become bigger.,Happy
1106," Could be. They're huge. But I think Macy's may have found a sweet spot, clothes for adults and kids. Do you agree?",Curious to dive deeper
1106,I totally agree plus they allow you to instantly make a return ionstead of haviong to send it through the mail again too much hassle and expense in that,Happy
1106,Right. Did you know Macy's updates include a line of clothing and hajabs (headscarves) for Muslim women?,Curious to dive deeper
1106,That's great to hear! Equal opportunity for everyone according to Macy's,Happy
1106," Yes. They're about mainstream apparel. But, clothing can be different depending on the culture. Mainstream is one culture may mean animal skins. Right?",Curious to dive deeper
1106," Yea, thats correct but not normally worn as an everyday fashion",Happy
1106," I guess. Pretty toasty! Glad we've come a long way from Pilgrim clothing. They didn't wear only black, it seems. Used plant & animal dyes to color clothes. Those dull pilgrims on the bulletin board in grade school were not the real thing!!",Curious to dive deeper
1106," Yeah, well the pilgrims on the school boards were the first to land at plymouth and the first Thanksgiving so it was a special occasion to wear the black clothes",Happy
1106," Yes. Are there specific things, like electronics or toys, that you purchase from Amazon?",Curious to dive deeper
1106," Oh yeah, i buy all types of electronics and toys from Amazon like RC cars, action figures, etc",Happy
1106," Me, too, especially cars & action figures for Xmas. Do you remember when Amazon was just an online bookstore?",Curious to dive deeper
1106," Oh yeah, in the late 90s then they grew exponentially!",Happy
1106,Right. I'm glad they developed Amazon film & tv studios. Is there a fav. show or series you watch?,Curious to dive deeper
1106," Yeah, that is great that Amazon did just especially to be more competitive. I love supernatural shows and movies and you?",Happy
1106,Watch The Grand Tour: car guys series. Lots of humor. Would you order shoes online - or do you like to try them on in a store?,Curious to dive deeper
1106," I would order them because i know my shoe size and brand that i like to wear. Well, i gotta run. It was great chatting with you! Take care, bye",Happy
1107,Is a 1.4 % increase in sales anything to really be proud of?,Neutral
1107," Yes, if you're talking about Macy's. I guess it depends on what 1.4% of what is.  It seems that Macy's department store wants to add some promotional gab about the consumer spending more on enhance quality of the merchandise.  Of course, it's big competitor is Amazon.",Curious to dive deeper
1107,For many years Macy's has been sliding down.  Amazon is expected to surpass Macy's as the largest apparel seller this year.  1.4% is not enough.,Neutral
1107," That's what I thought too.  Amazon is just too convenient and has the better prices.  Even Best Buy and Target will price match Amazon. If Macy's did that, I don't think they'd be in business too long.",Curious to dive deeper
1107,I see that some of the increase is from men's tailored clothing.  Difficult to buy that online.,Neutral
1107," True but that might the only unique item out there that fits that category.  After all, the arrow in Amazon's logo means from A to Z.",Curious to dive deeper
1107," I do not understand how people can buy without trying things on.  Sure, you could return but what a hassle.  I can not imagine buying shoes on line.  Maybe Macy's would do well point out shoes are easier in a store.",Neutral
1107," Also true. Even though Amazon holds a patent on 1-click buying, some items like shoes are better tried on first before you buy them.",Curious to dive deeper
1107," I wonder if Amazon ware house workers buy shoes from Amazon.  Walking 7 to 15 miles a day, they must go through some shoes.",Neutral
1107,I can imagine Amazon workers get great deals on everything.  They have a website that sells returned and like-new items with discounts.,Curious to dive deeper
1107,I have never bought anything that has been returned to Amazon.  Not knowingly anyway.  Have you tried AmazonBasics?,Curious to dive deeper
1107,Not personally but I've heard about it. I heard that AmazonBasics sells certain low-end products under it's in-house brand.,Curious to dive deeper
1107," I wonder what feels more like sandpaper, amazon toilet paper, or generic from wallmart.  I once attended an auction to buy stuff taken from airport check in line.",Neutral
1107," Good point. I wouldn't go with the airport stuff.  Speaking of airports, did you know that a man wore 70 items of clothing in a Chinese airport to avoid the bagging charge?  Could you imagine what he looked like?  lol",Curious to dive deeper
1107," Ha.  I think Joey did that on an episode of Friends.  If the wearing of clothing is restricted to human beings, then who enforces that.  No one I know is looking at chimps in hats and saying ""lets see some ID.""",Happy
1107," I know, right?  Talking about clothing, some people (who apparently lived in the area) used to do their laundry in Old Faithful; they put their clothes in the geyser and it would erupt with clean clothes.",Curious to dive deeper
1107,I bet clean and hot.  Now we cant fly a drone into the geyser let alone throw clothes.  I would like to see it though.,Neutral
1107," Me too. Did you know that bulletproof clothing mogul, Miguel Cabarello, shoots all his employees in order to test and enforce quality control on his wares? Gee, what a boss.",Curious to dive deeper
1107,I do not like the idea at all.  To many things can go wrong.  The design of clothing and shoes vary through time and from culture to culture.  I wonder if bulletproof will be how we are remembered.,Neutral
1107," I hope not.  An African tribe still wears Victorian clothes, the style of former German occupiers that they've made their own.",Curious to dive deeper
1107,Thats great.  I want to go there and have tea.  It has been said that the Pilgrims wore colorful cloths day to day.  Black was reserved for special occasions.  Think about that next thanksgiving.,Neutral
1107,Don't forget about the shoes you wear as well.  Did you know that there are 17 ways to tie your shoes?,Curious to dive deeper
1107,I am going to look up how to tie shoes on the internet.  I have a pair of 5000 year old shoes that smell funny. Nice chatting with you.,Neutral
1107,You as well.,Neutral
1108,Hello.  Do you watch youtube?,Curious to dive deeper
1108,I love youtube!,Surprised
1108,Me too!  It was created in Feb. 2005  I must have started watching it fairly quick because I think that's around when I started watching it.,Happy
1108,Me too! It's the second largest search engine! I love to look up DIY videos.,Curious to dive deeper
1108," Me too!  I also love to watch money making videos like how to make money with apps, reselling, etc.  Like to watch entrepreneur videos as well.  Google bought youtube in 2006 for $1.65 billion dollars!  Wow!",Happy
1108,Wow! I did not know that! Did you see Psy Ganham style video? It is so cool!,Curious to dive deeper
1108,It did.  Youtube is where I first heard about it.  Didn't it break the view counter or somthing?,Happy
1108,It did! They had to upgrade to 64 bits because of that!,Curious to dive deeper
1108," I remember it was something like that.  Justin Bieber's ""Baby"" is the most disliked video on youtube.  Poor Biebs.",Happy
1108,Have you seen him lately? Do you think we could watch Blutube?,Curious to dive deeper
1108,I haven't seen him lately.  I hope he hasn't ended up being on Blutube  That's the police version of youtube right?,Happy
1108,It is! Oh my goodness! That would be terrible for him!,Surprised
1108,Hahah....I'm surprised he hasn't done a rap song yet.  Are you a  rap fan?,Curious to dive deeper
1108,A little. I hear Drake is a big fan of reading though!,Curious to dive deeper
1108,That's good!  I love to read!  He must have dropped out of high school and then went back because he graduated high school in 2012 at the age of 25.,Happy
1108,Oh wow! I had no idea. He bought first edition copies of Charlottes web and winnie the pooh while in the UK.,Surprised
1108,Wow.  He must be a huge fan then.  I never knew that.  Where is Drake from?,Happy
1108,I honestly don't know! I know he has a university named after him though.,Curious to dive deeper
1108," I think he's from the Toronto, Canada area.  He received a grammy award for Best Rap Song for his ""Hotline Bling"" song.",Happy
1108,Thats really neat! I've read that he likes to play fortnite too!,Surprised
1108,How interesting is that?  I like how he visited Drake university one night during a tour stop.  The students there were trying to get him to come there and he did go only after they gave up trying to get him to come.  It's been a good chat!,Happy
1109,Hi how are you this morning?,Curious to dive deeper
1109,Not too bad. And you?,Curious to dive deeper
1109,I'm good thanks. Did you know that the pilgrims loved colorful clothes and only wore black now hite for special occasions? o,Curious to dive deeper
1109,Really? That is so weird. They are always depicted as having such drab clothing.,Surprised
1109,Yes I agree and think so too. lol3,Curious to dive deeper
1109,It makes sense that it would be colorful though. They used plant extracts to dye the clothes and all of those extracts produce some very vibrant colors.,Neutral
1109,Yes I wonder if they felt the same way with their shoes and such.,Happy
1109,Clothes seem like such a subjective business. I don't think I could make it as a fashion guru. It never occurs to me to look for a collar gap on someone's shirt.,Neutral
1109,Yes me either I seen also that 5000 year old shoes can perform better than new shoes. That's crazy.,Happy
1109,I think we sometimes go to extremes with modern shoes. Some of the shoes for women in particular are more about fashion than function.,Curious to dive deeper
1109,Absolutely I couldn't agree more. I cant believe ballet dancers can go through 3 pairs of tips a week .,Happy
1109,That I can see. I'm involved in a dance studio and the sheer amount of wear on those is crazy. The hours that a pro must put in would rub that delicate fabric to nothing.,Neutral
1109,How much do ballet shoes cost approximately?,Curious to dive deeper
1109,I think a good pair of pointe shoes is over 100 bucks. Simple ballet slippers can be about 25-30 bucks.,Neutral
1109,Oh ok Do you ever shop on amazon?,Curious to dive deeper
1109,I do quite a bit. you can find anything on amazon. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
1109,Yes I do as well. Did u know that the post office has a contract with amazon to deliver packages on sundays?,Curious to dive deeper
1109,I've noticed that. I never used to get my packages on sundays but now in the last year or so I've started. It is kind of nice when it is something you really need for work or school.,Neutral
1109,Yes I bet I have never had anything delivered on sundfy but do look forward to the possibility. Its been nice talking to ya.,Curious to dive deeper
1109,You as well. It has been very enlightening.,Neutral
1109,Have a good day,Curious to dive deeper
1110,Do you know much about the white house?,Curious to dive deeper
1110,I know that Carter kept the temperature really low there during winter,Curious to dive deeper
1110,WOw. THere are twin buildings of it in Ireland and France,Curious to dive deeper
1110,Nice. Do you know their first phone number?,Curious to dive deeper
1110,I have no idea for I know that Roosevelt did not allow christmas trees in there,Curious to dive deeper
1110,WOw that is too much. The number was 1,Curious to dive deeper
1110,WOw that is really fitting. Did you know they still use floppy discs,Curious to dive deeper
1110,Wow cool. There is replica of it in Alabama too and it is a private home,Curious to dive deeper
1110,WOw. The white house was hit in 2011 and no one noticed for  4 days,Curious to dive deeper
1110,WOw that is scary. Do you like dogs?,Curious to dive deeper
1110,I love dogs. Did you know they have 12 blood types?,Curious to dive deeper
1110,WOw that is nest. They can learn up to 1000 words,Curious to dive deeper
1110," Yes and they understand poininting, just like elephants",Curious to dive deeper
1110,Yeah and they can reason better than chimps,Curious to dive deeper
1110,Nice. Did you know Google declare themselves to be a dog company?,Curious to dive deeper
1110,WOw that is cool. Dogs can have eureka moments and they love getting rewards for slving problems,Curious to dive deeper
1110,Nice. Did you know that they are not colorblind?,Curious to dive deeper
1110,I thought they were. DO you know how the drink water?,Curious to dive deeper
1110,No they just see less colors than we do. How do they drink?,Curious to dive deeper
1110,They actually drink with the underside of their tongue,Curious to dive deeper
1110,Wow awesome. Nice chatting with you,Curious to dive deeper
1111,I had no idea a cat had ever been cloned.,Surprised
1111," Hello, that was new information to me as well! ",Surprised
1111,Seems a bit odd considering the overpopulation problem we have as it is lol,Surprised
1111," This is true, I wondered if the cat behaved in the same ways as the original. ",Surprised
1111," I never thought of that. It also said cat not kitten so was it created with the brain and ""knowledge"" of whatever age the original cat was I wonder",Curious to dive deeper
1111," That is an interesting point! I didn't think of it in that way. It is also interesting that cat lovers are known as ""ailurophiles""",Happy
1111,I'm a dog lover myself. I love that Istanbul has vending machines for stray dogs to get water and encourages recycling at the same time. Seems like we are slacking a bit here in the U.S,Neutral
1111," I understand, that would make you an ""cynophile"" according to the article. I enjoy being around animals, they have wonderful personalities. Theodore Roosevelt had over 20 pets himself apparently!",Happy
1111,I know teddy bears are called teddy bears because of his love of bears. i don't remember the details of the story but if you google it it's actually a pretty cute part of history,Neutral
1111,I will definitely check that out. We need more cure history stories. It was interesting to read that the dog was the first species to be domesticated; it makes me sad somewhat.,Curious to dive deeper
1111,Look at it this way... imagine how overpopulated they would be if they were just running wild and mating by instinct with no spay/neutering,Happy
1111,It reminds me of a family guy episode when they were in a dimension warp and dogs ruled lol. Dogs have become accustomed to human behavior.,Happy
1111,i LOVE that episode! lol,Happy
1111,haha I was hoping you knew what I was referring to.,Happy
1111," yeah, they went through a bunch of different dimensions. brian and stewie.",Happy
1111," There was another episode when Peter ran for a political position, I can't remember if it was president or not. It was neat to hear that the white house still uses floppy disks...I can't believe those disks still exist",Happy
1111,i have not seen that one,Neutral
1111,these articles presented information that I plan to research further,Neutral
1111,the 12 blood types thing for dogs is interesting,Neutral
1111,I've never heard of a dog blood drive!,Neutral
1111,thats a very valid point. surely there must be a need you would think,Curious to dive deeper
1111,they probably bring it to certain vets,Neutral
1111,or organ donors for canines,Neutral
1111,very true!,Neutral
1111," i work in dog rescue, i may inquire about that in my community",Neutral
1112,Hello! How are you?,Curious to dive deeper
1112," Great.  Do you like to go to concerts? Wow, Linkin Park played 324 concerts in the year 2001!",Surprised
1112,I do! That is crazy! I guess the success of an album can do that!,Curious to dive deeper
1112," Even the Ramones have played 2,263 concerts.  They toured non-stop for over 20 years.  No wonder they wanted to be sedated!",Surprised
1112,haha too funny! Can you believe Creed was sued once for a terrible concert they put on?,Curious to dive deeper
1112,That must have been a really bad concert.  I guess 4 people sued.  I have to wonder if they were in the same group or law firm.  Sounds frivolous...,Curious to dive deeper
1112,People want to get the best out of their money I guess haha. I didn't know Google was started back in 1998!,Curious to dive deeper
1112,I didn't know Google went down for 5 minutes in 2013.  I probably blamed my ISP.,Surprised
1112," haha, it even took 40 percent of web traffic with it!",Curious to dive deeper
1112," Yes, Google is huge.  Funny, a single Google search requires more computing power than it took to send Neil Armstrong and 11 other astronauts to the moon!  Amazing nerds with slide-rules! ",Surprised
1112,I guess you can get millions of results in less than a second so I believe it! Do you know how google maps works?,Curious to dive deeper
1112,You mean by calculating traffic by monitoring Android devices?  Why not iPhones?  Apple would probably sue them...,Curious to dive deeper
1112,They probably would. It goes to show that Android users are always being watched lol.,Curious to dive deeper
1112,It is kind of scary... Scary like Google using goats to mow the lawn.  I would hate to get that vet bill.,Surprised
1112,Haha I agree! Do you know any facts about the moon?,Curious to dive deeper
1112," A few.  I know that it has a peak that is higher than Mt. Everest at 1,938 meters higher. No fair, the moon has 1/6th the gravity.",Surprised
1112,How can people even calculate that haha.,Curious to dive deeper
1112," Slide-rules?  Mars has lame moons.  They aren't even spherical. There best moon, Phobos, is hollow and looks like a tortured potato. ",Surprised
1112," Haha that would be a sight to see! Some say it was artifical in origin! Anyways, nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
1112," Yeah, I think I saw the aliens that did it the other night and then they quit giving me beer.  Wow, there may be life on Saturn's moon Titan... ",Surprised
1112,Haha maybe they were the ones? Have a good one!,Curious to dive deeper
1113,What did you think of the Wonder Woman film in 2017? Do you think it lived up to the hype or was it a flop in your opinion?,Curious to dive deeper
1113," yes, lets talk about wonder women. It earned a lot of money, being the highest grossing superhero origin movie and WW1 movie",Surprised
1113," Yeah, but I feel that the reason it was so high grossing is because of the hype built around it. You know, first female super hero and all that nonsense. I think it was too over hyped.",Neutral
1113," interesting, 2017 was the first time since 1958 that the 3 highest grossing films had female leads",Surprised
1113," True, but they this movie wasn't the only female super hero film. I mean they had a lot of different ones since 1958. I mean Cat Woman was one of them and ironically enough Gal Gadot though she was auditioning for cat woman.",Neutral
1113," yup, she also was in the Israel defense forces for two years, that must have helped her also",Surprised
1113," Yeah, I wonder if she actually saw any kind of combat or if she was just in the reserves or something. I thought she played the role decently, maybe her military training was a help to her.",Neutral
1113," yeah, the character came a long way figuring she started as a secretary when she first joined the justice society. ",Surprised
1113,Yeah I think she joined in 1941. I think the movie just came out at a good time. All the other movies like star wars and beauty and the best just wasn't very good overall. Wonder Woman was kind of the only other practical choice at the time.,Neutral
1113," Lets talk about Facebook next. Myspace could have bought Facebook for 75 million , i'm guessing they regret that choice not to",Surprised
1113,Well I could see why they wouldn't buy it. At the time MySpace was the only real social media platform. Face Book was nothing more than a website for Harvard students when it was made. I wouldn't of bought it either.,Neutral
1113,schleswig-holstein in Germany made the like button illegal,Surprised
1113,I don't blame them. I'm sick of seeing their like button too. I think Burger King hated them too. They gave you a free whopper if you unfriended 10 people.,Happy
1113,that's interesting. the reason for the blue color scheme is because zuckerburg suffers from colorblindness,Surprised
1113,Really? That is actually surprising. Just as surprising as Iceland rewriting their constitution via Facebook. I wonder if they regret doing that.,Surprised
1113," Let talk about Superheros next, in the united states there are over 300 of them ",Surprised
1113,You mean fictionally right? Not actual people? I figured about 90% of super heroes were created here in the states. 300 seems to be fairly low. I guess the rest are unregistered.,Neutral
1113,I like the idea that there is a series dedicated to fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes.,Surprised
1113,Really!? I'll have to read that. Do you consider Batman a super hero? I don't considering super heroes normally have some kind of super human ability.,Curious to dive deeper
1113," that's is a tough one, maybe I do overall. There is a normalman superhero which is interesting. ",Surprised
1113,Oh that is the guy that actually didn't have any super powers right? I think everyone on the planet was super human except him. Seems interesting. I wonder what he did.,Curious to dive deeper
1113," me too, the loss of Stan lee is huge since he wrote 15 dc comics ",Surprised
1113," Yeah, The guy lived  a long life and his work will live on as long as people read comics. He was a national treasure in my opinion.",Sad
1113,Agreed he also re-imaged batman and superman,Surprised
1114,hi how are you? do you like google?,Neutral
1114,i use google for everything. did you know a single google search requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts to the moon,Surprised
1114," Yeah, i believe. computer power has improved so quickly. every couple years or so it basically doubles.",Neutral
1114,wow in 2013 google went down for a mere 5 minutes and took 40% of web traffic with it,Surprised
1114," Yeah, the world would come to a halt if the internet died. what could anyone do? nothing could get done.",Neutral
1114,can you imagine the pressure on google and its employees? to keep the world running! google maps calculates traffic by tracking how fast android devices are moving on the road. Im not sure if thats cool or an invasion of privacy,Neutral
1114,I think that people are happy that others provide the info to make traffic better but do not want to get busted for speeding LOL,Neutral
1114,googles headquarters are in california and its nicknamed the Googleplex,Neutral
1114,That is a great pun. complex. googleplex. i bet it is an interesting place to work.,Neutral
1114,oh hahaha I didnt even put that together! google was founded in 1998.,Neutral
1114," Yeah, the company is only 20 years old, but boy, for the younger generation, they only know a world with google.",Neutral
1114,this is totally true. im not the younger generation but I can barely remember a time without google,Neutral
1114," Yeah, i remember a time before the web. before the internet. the world was very different, and so were computers.",Neutral
1114,i remember our first computer and dial up. AOL was the main thing back then.,Neutral
1114," Yeah, the chirping modem and the welcome screen. i used to log into BBSs back in the day. a lot has changed.",Neutral
1114,ooooh ya floppy disks like true FLOPPY disks and a big huge box for a monitor and green lettering lol. google reorganized in 2015  and created alphabet corp. google is actually a subsidiary now.,Surprised
1114," yeah, i guess for tax purposes it made sense. google is huge.",Neutral
1114,speaking of huge. at the moons highest point its 1938 meters which is taller than everest,Surprised
1114," I cant imagine scaling something that high, even in low gravity. plus the moon is not that safe.",Neutral
1114,moon dust cuts through kevlar. so yes the moon is not safe,Surprised
1114," I would not want to go there. not even on vacation. anyway, great chat!",Neutral
1114,good day,Neutral
1115,Did you like the Wonder Woman movie?,Curious to dive deeper
1115,I really enjoyed it! It was awesome to finally see a female protagonist who was really killing it,Curious to dive deeper
1115,I agree.  Did you know when Gal Gadot auditioned she thought she was testing for catwoman?,Curious to dive deeper
1115," Wow, I didn't know that. That's crazy! I'm excited to see what they do with the franchise moving forward. Have you heard they're filming a sequel?",Curious to dive deeper
1115," I have not heard.  But since it did so well, they must be a sequel coming.  I can't wait!",Curious to dive deeper
1115,Yeah I think some of the filming was going on over the summer in Washington DC. Maybe you saw some posts on instagram or facebook about it?,Curious to dive deeper
1115," Not that you mention it, I may have heard about that on social media.  I hope it comes out soon.  Did you Gadot served 2 years in the Isreal defense force?",Curious to dive deeper
1115," I didn't know for sure but it makes sense. It's a requirement that people serve in the military after high school in Israel. But yeah, I think it comes out in November of this year. Are you generally a fan of superhero movies? ",Curious to dive deeper
1115," Yes, while i don't take them too seriously, they are very fun too watch, a good escape from the world.",Happy
1115,Yeah definitely. And the genre is exploding right now. Did you grow up with comic books and stuff?,Curious to dive deeper
1115,I did.  The Archie comics were my favorite.  It is now a TV show!  Did you have a favorite comic book series growing up?,Curious to dive deeper
1115," Yeah Riverdale right? I've seen a couple episodes hahaha. No, I wasn't really into comics growing up, my parents didn't let us watch cartoons or anything. But I've seen the Ironman movies and Wonder Woman and a few other superhero things. Do you have any other favorites?",Curious to dive deeper
1115,I never got into the superhero comics as a kid although i enjoy the movies today.  Did you know there is a superhero called normalman who is the only normal person on a planet of super heroes?,Curious to dive deeper
1115,Hahaha I've never heard of that. I feel like that would suck! IS it from one of the big franchises? DC or Marvel? Or is it some other thing?,Curious to dive deeper
1115,I am not sure where it is from but i think it is kind of a spoof on superhero comics.,Curious to dive deeper
1115,That's cool. The whole origins of the genre are kind of fascinating. I mean like there are some that are probably almost a hundred years old right?,Curious to dive deeper
1115,I believe so.  Marvel should make a comic book about the history of comic books.,Happy
1115,Yeah. I think DC has done a few books including one on Batman. It's like about how one would become Batman or something.,Neutral
1115,Interesting.  Did you know there are over 300 registered superheroes just in the United States?,Curious to dive deeper
1115,Wow I didn't know that. But that makes sense! I think there are 30 superhero movies set to be released between 2016-2020.,Neutral
1115,That is great.  Superhero movies are my favorite kind to see in theater.  I think they are much better on the big screen.,Curious to dive deeper
1115,Definitely. I'm looking forward to seeing the new wonder woman in November. Let's catch up after!,Neutral
1115,Sounds good!  Bye,Happy
1115,Bye!,Neutral
1116,The White House is a place with a lot of history,Curious to dive deeper
1116,It is! Teddy Roosevelt banned christmas trees there,Neutral
1116,Do you know why he did that?,Curious to dive deeper
1116,He was a staunch conservationist,Neutral
1116," I see, well that makes sense you know the White House has twin buildings in Ireland and in France",Curious to dive deeper
1116,I wonder if the heads of state reside there as well,Curious to dive deeper
1116," I dont think so but thats interesting, I wonder if they have solar planels like the original White House has",Curious to dive deeper
1116,I find it interesting that it was George W Bush who had them installed,Surprised
1116," I never knew Bush cared about the environment, its a great thing he did, solar energy is the future",Curious to dive deeper
1116,It really is. Do you have any pets?,Curious to dive deeper
1116," I do have a dog, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1116,I have some fish.,Neutral
1116,Fish are kind of boring no?,Curious to dive deeper
1116,They are relaxing to stare at. ANd dont require as much maintenance as other pets,Neutral
1116," I guess thats a good thing, maintanence can be hard, my dog sure makes it hard for me",Happy
1116,What kind of dog do you have?,Curious to dive deeper
1116," I have a golden retriever, big dog, lots of trouble",Curious to dive deeper
1116,Did you know google prefers dogs to cats?,Surprised
1116," I did know that, interesting fact about dogs is that they can have 1 out of 12 different types of blood",Curious to dive deeper
1116,That is neat. And they can donate blood as well,Surprised
1116," Yeah im taking mine later, I have to contribute and help sick dogs. ",Curious to dive deeper
1117,Are you a big fan of attending music concerts?,Happy
1117," omg i love concerts , my favorite but for personal reasons was tears for fears",Happy
1117,Which year did you attend the concert?,Happy
1117,2011 i think the way they sound .... as good as before,Surprised
1117,Definitely are you a fan of floyd at all or is that a little too old school?,Curious to dive deeper
1117," just a little bit too old , not fan of pink floyd, i prefer peter gabriel ",Surprised
1117,Did you ever have the opportunity to go see him live?,Neutral
1117," no ,sadly no , how about u ",Curious to dive deeper
1117,I have only been to music festivals where multiple bands play but never a singular artist or bands concert,Happy
1117," to me a concert is something magical theres so much energy , it makes u feel energized and alive",Surprised
1117,Its an experience more then it is an event. Do you know how many concerts the ramones ended up playing in total during their whole career?,Surprised
1117," no ,how many ",Surprised
1117," After touring almost non stop for 20 years it totaled to about 2,263 concerts. Do you use google alot?",Curious to dive deeper
1117,every day all day for anything i want to know about,Neutral
1117,Do you know which year the company was founded?,Curious to dive deeper
1117,1998,Curious to dive deeper
1117,Do you know at which University the 2 founders were enrolled at?,Curious to dive deeper
1117,They went to Stanford.,Curious to dive deeper
1117,Yes I truly believe the changed the world and the way we currently have knowldge always at our finger tips,Happy
1117,made the life easier for everyone,Neutral
1117,They started a revolution,Happy
1118,Do you have a favorite superhero?,Curious to dive deeper
1118," Hey there yes I do, one superhero I don't like is Wonder Woman though, did you hear that they are filming the sequel to that movie right now in DC",Curious to dive deeper
1118," Really? I did not know that. I kind of liked the movie but not the character, she sure was sexy!",Curious to dive deeper
1118,Yes she was! it's crazy that Wonder Woman was the highest grossing superhero origin movie of all time though,Surprised
1118,I did not know that. Apparently Gal Gadot thought she was auditioning for a cat woman movie and not wonder woman lol,Curious to dive deeper
1118," Haha that's a completely different movie, did you know that she actually served as a soldier in the Israeli military?",Surprised
1118," I knew that, man I would join that military wherever she was. Do you like marvel or dc",Curious to dive deeper
1118," Well I like Batman is my favorite superhero, but besides him I don't like anyone in the DC Universe LOL what about you",Curious to dive deeper
1118," I love the flash and batman lol. There are 300 registered superheroes in the US, crazy ",Curious to dive deeper
1118,That is crazy. Probably my least favorite superhero would be normal man because he doesn't have any powers LOL,Surprised
1118," Ha, I am normal man, don't tell anyone. I am just normal and the most average guy ever",Curious to dive deeper
1118,Haha that's funny. Did you hear that Garfield has a spin-off or he's a superhero? Do you think his superpower is laziness,Curious to dive deeper
1118,lol i did not know that! I would pay for that. Did you know stan lee wrote 15 dc comics?,Curious to dive deeper
1118," Wow I didn't know that, he was very talented! What do you think about a comic book series about fixing the collateral damage that was caused by a lot of superheroes? That's very realistic ID I think",Surprised
1118," I am not sure, I always wonder that when I see big buildings crumble, someone has to pay",Curious to dive deeper
1118,Yep you're right someone has to pay for it haha. Do you ever use Facebook by the way? Did you ever do the Burger King challenge,Curious to dive deeper
1118," I did lol and I got like 5 free whoppers and 50 people mad at me, lol! Did you?",Curious to dive deeper
1118,LOL I wish I could have done that. I'm so hungry right now that if that we're going on I would unfriend everyone to get all of the Whoppers that I could get LOL,Happy
1118,for sure! did you know myspace could have bought facebook!,Curious to dive deeper
1118," I did hear about that, they put it offer 75 million and  Myspace refused LOL talk about a bad idea",Surprised
1118," right, myspace sucked! Good chatting  with you!",Curious to dive deeper
1119,do you go to concerts?,Curious to dive deeper
1119,I sure do. Did you know Linkin Park played 324 concerts in a year?,Curious to dive deeper
1119,Yeah that was because their album in 2011 was too successfull,Curious to dive deeper
1119,Yeah. THe Ramones also toured for 20 years in a row,Curious to dive deeper
1119," Yeah and played a total of 2263 concerts, insane",Curious to dive deeper
1119,Yeah it is. In Croatia there is an ancient theatre where they host concerts,Curious to dive deeper
1119," Yeah same as in Pompeii, they have one of those there too",Curious to dive deeper
1119,yeah Pink Floyd once played a concert there but without an audience,Curious to dive deeper
1119,Yeah that seems a bit of waste but they likely has a reason,Curious to dive deeper
1119,Yes I bet so too. Did you heard about that really bad creed concert?,Curious to dive deeper
1119,Yes so bad that people sued them at the end of it,Curious to dive deeper
1119,Yeah that must have cost them more than the concert itself,Curious to dive deeper
1119,Yeah. Do you use google much?,Curious to dive deeper
1119,all the time. Do you know how they calculate traffic?,Curious to dive deeper
1119,Yes they take the average of android devices on the road,Curious to dive deeper
1119,yes it is pretty cool and also a little bit scary that they have access to our phones,Curious to dive deeper
1119,True. DId you know Google once hired goats instead of people to mow the lawn?,Curious to dive deeper
1119,Yeah good for them. ANd once they went down and took most of the web traffic down with it,Curious to dive deeper
1119," Yeah that was in 2003, and it was 40% of the traffic, insane",Curious to dive deeper
1119,I know Do you know how they mark their maps when there is a border dispute?,Curious to dive deeper
1119,yes they tailor it to the claim of each country,Curious to dive deeper
1119,Yeah I guess that is fair enough,Curious to dive deeper
1120,I love dogs. Do you like dogs?,Curious to dive deeper
1120," I do love dogs.  They are so funny.  Imagine a show on BBC about dogs for dogs, by dogs.  Who is a good boy?",Happy
1120,I can imagine that. A lot of people leave their tv on for their dogs when they are gone. Did you know that there are 12 different blood types for dogs?,Curious to dive deeper
1120," No, I had no idea. Do you believe dogs can learn 1000 words and are better at reasoning than a chimp?",Curious to dive deeper
1120," I did not know that. So that confirms my belief that they are choosing not to listen to you when they don't want to ha ha. Dogs are smart, along with elephants they are also the only animals to understand pointing. ",Happy
1120," Dogs were selectively bread of millennia to produce certain traits.  I wonder if a dog can be stamped non GMO.  Ha, I kid. No dog listens until a treat is involved.",Neutral
1120," I agree. They listen quickly then. I had heard before that dogs were color blind and always questioned it because I've had dogs that seemed to like toys of specific colors. It's not true, they can see colors just not as many as us. ",Curious to dive deeper
1120,I imagine taste is the big driver for dog toy choice.  I know some dogs in Moscow are smart enough to use the subway.,Happy
1120,That's amazing. I know that in Istanbul they have vending machines that release food and water for stray dogs which I really like and wish we would implement here.,Curious to dive deeper
1120," That is a cool thing to know.  As good as dogs are, the cat is the most popular pet in the world.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1120,I love cats but that surprises me. I know that the first cloned pet was a cat.,Surprised
1120," First cloned pet was a cat.  What, there was a spot of sunshine without a furball at the end.... a box that sat on the floor empty.  It is illegal to keep rabbits in Queensland, unless your a magician.",Happy
1120,That is a super strange law. I wonder why that is? I was saddened to learn that there are more tigers living as pets in the United States than there are tigers living in Asia in the wild. We really need to protect them better.,Sad
1120," The Queensland law is because rabbits are invasive and have no predators.  Wipe out farms and such.  For the same reason, it is illegal to own a pet hamster in Hawaii.",Neutral
1120," That makes sense. So weird that they would have no predators. Speaking of more exotic pets, Theodore Roosevelt had over 20 pets including a bear and a hyena. How in the world o you keep those dangerous animals?",Surprised
1120,Theodore was a rough rider.  I am sure he was tougher than the bear.  Jimmy Carter had solar panels installed on the white house... Preserving the environment is a good thing.,Happy
1120,He was tough. Carter has done so much good work since his presidency. He is a very good person. Did you know that Roosevelt was also a conservationist and banned Christmas trees in the white house?,Curious to dive deeper
1120," Roosevelt banned Christmas trees.. seems odd.  The solar panels installed by Carter were removed by Ronald Reagan.  One step forward, one step back.",Neutral
1120,Very sad to hear that. I don't understand why you would do that. Apparently the white house still uses floppy disks somewhat for storing files? I don't know when the last time I saw one of those was.,Surprised
1120,One more little bit about the white house. Jimmy Carter turned the thermostats down to 65 in the winter of 77.   I saw a usb floppy drive connected to an android phone work in a video.,Curious to dive deeper
1120,Wow! That's crazy. I didn't know they still made them. I was shocked in 2011 when it took them four days to discover that there were bullets stuck in the white house. That's terrifying!,Surprised
1120," Yes, living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC seems like an iffy thing.  Good for being on camera, bad for being shot at.",Neutral
1120,Apparently. You'd think they would be more on top of it with all of the secret service.,Curious to dive deeper
1121,When is the last time you went to a concert?,Curious to dive deeper
1121,I saw Elton John on his current tour.  His voice is still amazing at 70 years old.,Neutral
1121,Oh wow. That certainly sounds better than a linkin park concert,Neutral
1121," Or Imagine Dragons.  Songs with hooks, but with no edge at all.",Curious to dive deeper
1121,I would love to see Imagine Dragons in concert but I haven't gotten the chance yet.,Neutral
1121,They do play a lot.  But leader Dan Reynolds tries to walk a tightrope between his music and his Mormon faith.  It doesn't always work.,Curious to dive deeper
1121,I wonder if they will be able to manage a tour for as long as the Ramones did.,Curious to dive deeper
1121,The Imagine Dragons did a show for HBO.  You might be able to see it if you have the right subscription services.,Neutral
1121," Unfortunately, I do not have HBO. Is it on Google or YouTube?",Neutral
1121," Not sure, you'll have to do a search.  As it is, band leader Reynolds is going through a divorce, and is try to reconcile his feelings about LGBTQ with the Mormon teachings.",Neutral
1121,Have you seen or been to the Ancient Roman amphitheater where some of the first concerts were held?,Curious to dive deeper
1121,No.  Wonder what kind of music was played.,Curious to dive deeper
1121,Pink Floyd once played there so I would imagine all kinds of music,Neutral
1121,And the Grateful Dead once played at the Egyptian pyramids.  Curious how they did without amplification.  The Foo Fighters one played a concert so loud it was detected on seismic monitors in New Zealand.,Neutral
1121,I saw the Foo Fighters in San Francisco after they ended a year long tour.,Neutral
1121,Lou Reed once did a high frequency concert for dogs.  I missed that one.,Neutral
1121,I did not know that. Were the dogs hurt by his music. It seems as though it might be too high pitched.,Curious to dive deeper
1121,Don't know.  Deep Purple played a show so loud that three audience members ended up unconscious.,Sad
1121,My parents were at that concert and near one of the persons who was affected. It was exhaustion and dehydration.,Neutral
1121,Apparently it is considered the loudest concert ever.,Neutral
1121,Time to go listen to some music from a prior concert on google.,Neutral
1122," Did you know that back in Caesar's day, people bred chickens for entertainment not for food?",Surprised
1122," Really, thats kind of crazy.  I heard the NFL is categorized as entertainment, not sports",Surprised
1122,That is curious I had not heard that.   The entertainment industry is funny - Ronald Reagan was once rejected from playing the president in a movie because he did not look presidential,Surprised
1122," I am not sure if there was ever anyone who looked more ""presidential"" whatever that means.  Lol",Neutral
1122,Perhaps not Bill Nye!  He got his big break by winning a Steve Martin lookalike contest!,Neutral
1122,Thats amazing!  He has certainly benefited greatly from that fame.,Neutral
1122,Yes.  Did you ever play Nintendo?  I used to love that system,Neutral
1122,I loved it!  IT was one of my favorite things.  I love Mario brothers!,Neutral
1122,Yes it was a great system even if only displayed 54 colors!,Neutral
1122," That is crazy, as a kid I always thought it was full color!  They stopped making the classic in 2003 i think.",Neutral
1122,Yes - did you ever play video hockey games?  They are fun but not as fun as the real sporty,Neutral
1122," No, I played a little hockey with my friends in the back yard growing up though.  I like to watch it.",Neutral
1122,Canada is the only country with 2 national sports - both lacrosse and ice hockey,Neutral
1122,I didnt know that about lacrosse.  I know there have been some crazy scores in games.,Neutral
1122,in 1924 canada won 124-3!!!!,Neutral
1122,That is even crazier than the 82-0 Slovakia - Bulgaria game,Neutral
1122,Wow!  Did you know that ice hockey rinks exist under basketball courts?,Neutral
1122,Yeah.  Ive seen a few like that.  I even graduated high school in an arena that usually has a hockey rink.,Neutral
1122,Nice.  Ice hockey is a lot of work to play - a typical pro will lose 8 pounds a game!  I need to get on that diet plan,Surprised
1122," Sign me up, except Ill lose the weight just trying not to fall on skates. lol",Neutral
1122,For sure!  hockey is challenging!,Neutral
1123," Are you a fan of either Fall Out Boy, Pat Sajak, Sting or Shaggy?",Curious to dive deeper
1123,I ve always loved Pat Sajak on Wheel.,Neutral
1123," He is a great artist, I like Fall Out Boy a bit more, one thing is for certain, they do give a great show and Vegas is lucky.",Curious to dive deeper
1123,Entertainment sure is diverse these days.,Neutral
1123," It is diverese, I think thats a great thing but sometimes the classics are lost, Fall Out Boy will perform outside of the arena before  game #4 I wish I could be there",Curious to dive deeper
1123," That would be awesome to see, I like their music.",Neutral
1123," I wish I was in Vegas now, do you like hockey?",Curious to dive deeper
1123," I do.  I watched the entire playoff and stanley cup series last year while I was in the hospital with cancer.  It was my reprieve, so I ve really gotten into it. ",Curious to dive deeper
1123," That sounds terrible! I hope you are better now and yeah I like hockey too, it can change your focus and cheer you up in bad times",Sad
1123," I am on the mend.  I loved watching them fight on skates.  It is crazy to think there was a time when there was only one box, and they would continue to fight in there.",Neutral
1123," The game has changed a lot since 1924, the first Olympic Winter games, Canada has two national sports",Curious to dive deeper
1123,In 1932 India beat the US 24-1.  That is a lot.,Neutral
1123,Really? India had a hockey team? and they managed to win against the US? I guess hockey wasnt a big thing at the US at the time,Surprised
1123," Probably not, at least it wasnt the 82-0 blowout that Slovakia and Bulgaria was",Neutral
1123," I didnt watch that one either, that must be like the biggest score difference in the history of the game, did you hear about that player that got traded for only $1",Curious to dive deeper
1123," Really, that is kinda crazy.  When did that happen?",Neutral
1123," That happened back in the year 1993, strange thing but the player ended up winning 4 Stanely cups after that",Surprised
1123,Wow.  Amazing investment for the other side.,Surprised
1123," I know right, I bet someone got fired that day, selling a great player for $1 I bet they did it as a mockery, well he showed them",Curious to dive deeper
1123,He really did.  There was once a goalie that caught on fire.  Puck struck some matches he had in his pocket.,Neutral
1123," I  wonder what he did, I would have panicked and screamed.",Fearful
1124,hey my friend do you like the Nintendo Entertainment System?,Curious to dive deeper
1124," Hello there, I am a huge fan, grew up playing, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1124," oh ya me too, crazy it came out in 1985 and was finally ended in 2003",Surprised
1124," Yeah that is, what was your favorite game or games?",Curious to dive deeper
1124," well I really like the Zelda games, I've played almost all of them, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1124," I never got into those too much, but knew they were good games.  I really liked Super Contra, and Tecmo Super Bowl. ",Curious to dive deeper
1124," oh ya those are good, its funny looking back that the NES only had about 54 colors to work with",Surprised
1124," That is funny, I wonder how many they use now, I'm sure its in the thousands or hundreds. ",Curious to dive deeper
1124,oh ya might be millions! good thing we don't live in roman times they used chickens for entertainment haha,Surprised
1124," That is too funny, I don't know how much I would like living back around 50BC, I don't think much. ",Curious to dive deeper
1124," nope doesn't sound fun to me haha, didyou watch bill nye the science guy?",Curious to dive deeper
1124," Yeah I used to watch when I was younger, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1124," ya I did, I guess he got his start by winning a steve martin lookalike contest",Surprised
1124," That is too funny, I wonder if he thought he could make it big as a tv scientist doing that?",Curious to dive deeper
1124," haha, what do you think about Ronald Reagan being told hes not presidential?",Surprised
1124," That's funny as well, I always think of the line in Back to the Future when I hear Ronald Reagan and actor. ",Curious to dive deeper
1124," haha ya back to the future was actually reagans favorite movie, probably from that line haha",Happy
1124," Right, he was probably pumped when he watched it for the first time, I would be!",Curious to dive deeper
1124," oh ya for sure, do you like hockey at all?",Curious to dive deeper
1124," I am a fan, but not a big one.  I would start to follow it more if I had a local team to cheer, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1124," ya I like the Penguins a lot, I guess it is canada's national sport, that along with lacrosse",Curious to dive deeper
1124," Nice, well it was nice talking with you today, I hope you have a good day. ",Happy
1125,Seems like Washington has a great lineup of artists in plan,Curious to dive deeper
1125,Yeah who would have thought Sting and Shaggy would be hooked up together.,Curious to dive deeper
1125," I think thats a great duo also Fall Out Boy, ",Curious to dive deeper
1125,I didn't realize the show before the Stanley Cup finals was such a big deal. Before Game 1 in Vegas there was a sword fight!,Curious to dive deeper
1125," That sounds amazing, there are a lot of cool shows over there, what forms of entertainment do you like?",Curious to dive deeper
1125," I like movies, music, etc. I do like to watch Hockey. It's a fun sport to watch.",Curious to dive deeper
1125," I do like to watch hockey, its a fun but violent sport",Curious to dive deeper
1125," It take as a lot of skill though. I didn't realize there was so many kinds...field hockey, ice hockey, bandy??",Curious to dive deeper
1125," I  didnt eitehr, just hockey and ice hockey, how is bandy different do you know?",Curious to dive deeper
1125,I guess it is played on ice like ice hockey but game is like field hockey. Did you know an average professional hockey player loses 8 pounds in one game?,Curious to dive deeper
1125," 8 pounds in a game? wow, I have to buy some skates right away and learn how to play the game lol",Curious to dive deeper
1125," I know right? In 1993, a hockey player was traded for $1 then went on to win 4 stanley cups.",Curious to dive deeper
1125," For $1 no kidding? I bet the other team regretted that decision, letting a player like that leave for only a dollar",Curious to dive deeper
1125,True. Canada is the only country in the world with 2 national sports..ice hockey and lacrosse.,Curious to dive deeper
1125,The only one really? I know they liked hocky a lot but didnt know lacrosse was their other national  sport,Curious to dive deeper
1125," Yeah I was surprised too. In 1924, Canada scored 132 goals and only let in 3 at the first olympic winter games.",Curious to dive deeper
1125,Did you watch Wonder Woman?,Curious to dive deeper
1125,No I missed that one but I do like Wonder Woman in general.,Curious to dive deeper
1125,The leading actress is great she used to served in the Israel defence forces,Curious to dive deeper
1125,Yeah she is pretty impressive. I guess she thought she was testing for catwoman at first.,Curious to dive deeper
1125," She was? thats an interesting story, well she got a better role in the end. ",Curious to dive deeper
1126," Hi, what is your favorite form of entertainment ?",Curious to dive deeper
1126," Hello, I like to play video games such as nintendo what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1126," I really liked the Nintendo, even if it could only display 54 colors. ",Happy
1126," Yeah but its a classic, its a bad thing they dont make it anymore",Curious to dive deeper
1126," Yeah they stopped making it in 2003, but there is still the NES classic that does a pretty good job at emulating it. ",Neutral
1126," I think they should remake it, or at least a version of it",Curious to dive deeper
1126," Would you like something more powerful ? 54 colors is not a lot, compared to what a newer console can do nowadays. ",Curious to dive deeper
1126," I do have something more powerful an Xbox One but still, classic games are great and it would be nice to have them as well, do you know who Bill Nye is?",Curious to dive deeper
1126," Yeah, I saw him on TV when I was young, I think his show was called Bill Nye the Science Guy ? ",Neutral
1126," Yeah the same one, so he actually got a lucky break because he looked like Steve Martin and actually won a contest",Curious to dive deeper
1126," In must have been in the 70s, I don't think Steve Martin was popular enough  later to desserve a lookalike contest.  ",Surprised
1126," Yeah I think it was in the 70s they do have a really similar look, did you Reagan was also an actor?",Curious to dive deeper
1126," Yeah, I saw a documentary about him, he was a famous actor, he did a lot of westerns. You never knew that ?",Curious to dive deeper
1126," No I didnt, I just found out, it turns out he got rejected in a movie, the role was of President, they though he didnt have the presidential look, pretty ironic hugh",Surprised
1126," It was another era, before TV and the image took over, I think he would have had the role now where the look is more important than the brain. ",Sad
1126," Yeah I agree, so did you watch Wonder Woman?",Curious to dive deeper
1126," No I did not, but I have heard it was quite popular, was it ?",Curious to dive deeper
1126," It was, you know the main actress of the movie actually served in the Israely defense forces",Surprised
1126,And what is the story of the movie ? Is it any good ?,Curious to dive deeper
1126," Its good, it has a good plot its based on WWI and its about how Wonder Woman came to be, its the highest grossing superhero origin movie so that can give you an idea of the quality of the movie",Curious to dive deeper
1126,I think I will see it. Thanks for the conversation.,Happy
1127," Hi, do you like Adele?",Curious to dive deeper
1127,I know her music and could sing along to a song or two.,Curious to dive deeper
1127,Did you know Daniel Craig cried when he first heard the song for the Skyfall theme?,Surprised
1127," I hope out happiness and not distress.  I'm not sure I can bring hat song to mind, is it that good?",Curious to dive deeper
1127,I haven't heard it yet. I saw she went to high school with Winehouse and other famous people?,Surprised
1127," I wonder what they teach in that school, the performance artist teacher must be doing something right, or is it just chance.",Surprised
1127,I wonder as well. I saw she was influence by the Spice Girls.,Surprised
1127,I wouldn't have said anyone could be influenced by the Spice Girls.  I think as a performer she has surpassed them in terms of critical and commercial acclaim.,Happy
1127,I agree lol. Do you like fish?,Curious to dive deeper
1127," Never been much of fishing person, too much inactivity for me.  Had the odd goldfish in my time.",Neutral
1127,I love fishing. Did you know the black swallower fish can eat prey twice it's length?,Surprised
1127," I feel like that after some meals.  No, I've never been much of an outdoors person, I see danger where ever I look when in the wilderness.",Curious to dive deeper
1127,Me too lol. Freshwater fish drink through their skin while saltwater fish can drink through their mouths.,Surprised
1127," I was watching that Planet Earth series, saw that barreleye fish with the transparent head.  It lives in the deep and looks up all the time, looking through it head.",Surprised
1127,That's pretty crazy. Did you know the seahorse is the only fish to have a neck?,Surprised
1127," They are kind of unique.  Hard to even call them a fish from looking at them.  Same with jellyfish, are they even fish?",Curious to dive deeper
1127,I think they are a type of fish. I saw there is a type that is immortal and never dies,Surprised
1127," I would like to see the proof of that. Sadly whenever I had goldfish, I was so bad at keeping them alive! Another thing that's immortal, is our online profiles with things like Facebook.",Happy
1127,HAHA you're funny!,Neutral
1127," I try to stay away from Facebook, I spend enough time on the computer without another excuse to on it.  It sucks up a lot of peoples time.",Curious to dive deeper
1127," Me too. Well, it was good talking to you!",Happy
1127," Have a good day, put on some Adele to listen to.  Goodbye.",Neutral
1128,Do you use Facebook?,Curious to dive deeper
1128," All the time, both as a business and a personal account.",Neutral
1128," nice, I have a personal account. Can you imagine if myspace would have bought facebook back in the day at 75 million dollars",Curious to dive deeper
1128,They would definitely be a lot more relevant today.  I havent been on my space since 2006 anyway...,Neutral
1128,me too lol. I think myspace would have ruined this. Now facebook is worth like 104 billion dollars,Curious to dive deeper
1128,It must be nice to be Mark Zuckerburg.,Neutral
1128," For sure, he has been in the press too much lately, I couldn't do that",Curious to dive deeper
1128,He is actually color-blind that is why facebook is blue.,Neutral
1128," Wow didn't know that, I always thought blue was too much lol. Did you ever participate in the burger king promotion?",Curious to dive deeper
1128,No!  I could have eaten well for free though.  I could get rid of some people on my friends list for a whopper.,Neutral
1128," For sure, I have a ton of friends i could unadd lol",Curious to dive deeper
1128,It sure has a lot of use.  Iceland is even using it for input on constitution rewrites.,Neutral
1128," That is hilarious. I wonder if they get some crazy ideas! At least they allow the like button, some german state made it illegal",Curious to dive deeper
1128," I have heard that before.  I wonder how that works, if there is some sort of geofence that disables it for all people when they are in that region.",Neutral
1128,I was just thinking the same thing. Sounds more illegal than anything lol,Curious to dive deeper
1128," It really kind of does, like censorship.",Neutral
1128," for sure, oh well, at least it isn't here lol. do you like fish",Curious to dive deeper
1128," I like to loo at them, eat them not so much.  However Id like to be like that immortal jellyfish.  Thatd be cool",Neutral
1128," There is no way that thing couldn't die lol, there has to be a way! It was so nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
1128,It has been a great chat!  Have a great day!,Neutral
1128," you too, and a great weekend!",Curious to dive deeper
1129," hi, do you like watching movies",Neutral
1129," I love watching movies, especially good ones. ",Neutral
1129," I used to watch a lot of movies, but not nowaday because of not having time lately.  Btw, what type of movies do you like",Neutral
1129,I really enjoy foreign movies and dramas. I don't really care for too many comedies. Have you heard of this new film called Black Klansman? It's directed by Spike Lee and supposed to be about a black cop that goes undercover in the KKK.,Curious to dive deeper
1129," Never heard of that movie.  But I like the work of Spike Lee so far.  Do you watch movies on TV, netflix, or others",Curious to dive deeper
1129,I used to go to theaters a lot. Then I started renting videos at Blockbuster. But now I totally watch movies on Netflix.  Did you know Netflix is worth $2 billion dollars? Blockbuster turned down the chance to buy it!,Surprised
1129," Never heard about this fact.  I could not believe the success of Netflix, and I believe its value will keep increasing in the future",Surprised
1129," I'm worried about Netflix, though. They are producing more of their own movies and content, but they are racking up more and more debt, too. They owed like $21 billion in 2017 and now they owe $16.8 billion more.",Fearful
1129,I am wondering why they need to borrow money to make movies.  Did they gain dividend making those movies,Curious to dive deeper
1129," They need new content to keep their viewers. Did you know that in North American, 33% of all bandwidth is being used by Netflix accounts?",Surprised
1129," It was a lot of bandwidth.  Also, YouTube is another social media juggernaut that consume that much bandwidth.",Neutral
1129," Yes, Netflix and YouTube account for half of all internet traffic in North America. I think Netflix will eventually have to drop their DVD rentals, as it costs them 20 times more to mail out DVDs then what they spend on bandwith for people watching their content.",Neutral
1129," I concur.  Also, Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth",Surprised
1129," Yes, that's what I mentioned - postage is what they spend mailing out DVDs. Imagine though, Blockbuster, the video chain, could have purchased Netflix for $50 million, but they didn't.  Netflix is now worth $2 billion. Ouch!",Surprised
1129," I think they did not foresee the future potential of Netflix.  What a loss, ha.  Btw, did you know that Tom Hanks is the highest all time box office star",Surprised
1129," Yes, Blockbuster really missed the boat on that one. I'm surprised that Tom Hanks is that popular out of all the other movie actors out there.  Although, I heard the man who started Netflix racked up forty bucks in late fees on Tom Hank's movie Apollo 13.  That's why he started Netflix!",Surprised
1129,I have not seen a new movie played by Tom Hank for a while.  is he retired?,Curious to dive deeper
1129," I'm not sure.  The last one of his that I saw was the one about the murder in the museum in Paris. I forgot the title. Weird how some movies are blockbusters immediately, and some over time. For example, Sleeping Beauty was considered a box office failure when it first came out. Disney, who made the movie, even thought about closing up their animation studio because of it!",Surprised
1129," In my opinion, the popularity of a movie depends on variety of factors, and timing is one of the factors.",Neutral
1129," Yes, but think about this. The movie Silence of the Lambs came out on Valentine's Day. That's terrible timing! Not a date movie, But it made over $270 million dollars at the box office. Oh, and by the way, that Tom Hank's movie I saw was called The Da Vinci Code. Did you see it?",Curious to dive deeper
1129," Thank for your information.  Btw, nice chatting with you.  Have a happy holiday",Happy
1129,You're very welcome. Take care!,Neutral
1129,You too,Neutral
1129,Maybe next time we can talk about horses! lol,Curious to dive deeper
1130," hey there, do you like horses?",Curious to dive deeper
1130," I love horses, but my son became allergic to horses just like Clint Eastwood, so we had to stop going near them.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1130,That is too bad. Icelandic horses have a fifth speed which is like horse speedwalking,Surprised
1130,Yes.  I believe that is right.  We know just watch them on TV.  We just learned that Lipizzaner horses are born black or brown and take about six years to turn white.,Curious to dive deeper
1130," The breed of dogs, dalmatians are used by firefighter because they know how to calm and protect horses. How cute is that?",Surprised
1130," That is so comforting to hear.  Horses are gentle creatures.  I believe that why kids love them.  In fact, two high school kids decided to ride horses to school and they got suspended for it.  ",Happy
1130,That is a strange reason to be suspended. Do you watch much tv?,Curious to dive deeper
1130,Not really.  I enjoy watching Netflix.  Almost everyone I know watches either Netflix or Youtube.  It's no wonder that Netflix and Youtube make up half of peak internet traffic in the US.,Curious to dive deeper
1130,So true. Too bad for blockbster who refused to buy it for very little money.,Surprised
1130,Yes they should have invested in Netflix.  They'd still be in buisness.,Curious to dive deeper
1130,Exactly. Do you know how netflix got started?,Curious to dive deeper
1130," No, how did they get started?",Curious to dive deeper
1130,the owner had to pay for a late fee for a vhs and he was mad.,Surprised
1130," Yes, that happened to me all the time.  I always would say I was going to never go back and then I found Netflix.  It's no wonder that as of 2018, they have 137 million total subscribers.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1130,And they spend 20 times more on postage than bandwitdh. I wonder what they are mailing?,Surprised
1130,I believe they are sending DVD's through the mail still.  I stopped that subscription and now I am part of the 33% of Netflix accounts  bandwidth in North America.,Curious to dive deeper
1130," That is just mind-blowing. Speaking of dvd's and movies, do you know who is the highest all time box office star?",Surprised
1130,Is it Tom Hanks?,Curious to dive deeper
1130,Yes. I really like him as an actor so I am not so surprised. And Disney on the other hand when sleeping beauty failed considered shutting their movie studio down. Imagine that.,Surprised
1130,I love Sleeping Beauty.  How was it a bust.  Treasure Planet by Disney was an expensive move flop and for that movie I agree.,Curious to dive deeper
1130,Yeah they cannot all be hits. It was nice chatting with you.,Happy
1131,Are you a fan of google?,Curious to dive deeper
1131,I'm a fan of a lot of Google's stuff but I really dislike their Smart Compose feature on Gmail,Neutral
1131," Yeah, me too, but I use Gmail a lot?",Curious to dive deeper
1131," I'm not a big fan of the Smart Compose AI, I don't like the suggestions they have to responding to an email",Neutral
1131," Yeah, that seems sort of weird, they implemented it last year, right? ",Curious to dive deeper
1131," Yea, it's pretty ridiculous it suggested a person reply ""Awesome"" when reading an email about a ill friend",Disgusted
1131," Hilarious, I know. I don't like it one bit. I accidently hit it the other day. LOL",Curious to dive deeper
1131," Yea, companies are so focused on trying to innovate their products and service they release useless things like multi blade razors",Neutral
1131," That is true, I still use a bic. ",Curious to dive deeper
1131,It's pretty crazy in the 1800s they invented an alarm clock with an illuminated dial by attaching a match to it!,Surprised
1131," That is awesome. By the way, would you ever ride a bus that goes 160mph? ",Curious to dive deeper
1131," Yea, sound like a 160mph bus would be fun to ride",Neutral
1131,It reminds of that movie speed with Keanu Reeves. Have you seen it?,Curious to dive deeper
1131," Yea, Speed was a good movie but they were going 100mph slower than the Dutch bus",Neutral
1131," LOL, that is true. Did you know in Japan there are tolls on every highway?",Curious to dive deeper
1131," Yea, it's quite expense if you want to travel across Japan, it would be $300 in tolls alone",Neutral
1131," Wholly Molly! That is a lot just to drive, reminds me of D.C. ",Curious to dive deeper
1131,Well it's probably much more expensive to travel in Iceland since most people use domestic flights to travel,Neutral
1131," Hmm, they don't have roads there? That seems so weird. Well, nice chatting!",Curious to dive deeper
1131,Iceland has roads but to public rail service. Have a nice day,Neutral
1131," Oh, that's right. Well have a good day!",Curious to dive deeper
1132,How's it going? Do you like horses? They evolved from a multi-toed creature 45-55 million years ago,Curious to dive deeper
1132," Hi! I love horses, had them on our farm growing up. Wow, that's amazing!",Happy
1132," Yea, it's interesting how humans were able to domesticate such an unique animal so long ago in 4000 BC",Surprised
1132," That is amazing! I love how Dalmatians who are known to be with firefighters because they kepp the horsed calm and would protect them, awesome!",Surprised
1132,I find it crazy Clint Eastwood ended up developing an allergy to horses in mid-life,Surprised
1132," Really? I have never heard of people being allergic to horses, must be rare. I would love to be ride horses instead of driving, like the kids who rode their horses to ...no vehicle day....but they got suspended.",Happy
1132,Horses aren't vehicles so I have no idea why those students would get suspended,Curious to dive deeper
1132," Right? Makes no sense. So do you like to watch Netflix? I love the amount of shows they have. they have 137,000,000 subscribers worldwide, huge!",Surprised
1132," Yea I watch Netflix a lot, it's crazy how large they've became after starting out mailing dvds in 1998",Neutral
1132," Very true, such a big company especially after expanding to streaming media in 2007",Happy
1132," Yep, the only places without Netflix today is China, Syria, North Korea, and Crimea",Neutral
1132," Too sad for them! I bet Blockbuster is kicking themselves for not buying Netflix for only 50 million...now worth is 2 billion, lost a huge chance!",Neutral
1132," Yea, Blockbuster really screwed up by not buying netflix and charging a $40 late fee to Netflix founder Reed Hastings",Neutral
1132,I had those types of late fee's sometimes. I am happy we have Netflix now. I love the huge Box office hits on there besides tons of TV series.,Happy
1132," Yea, they have a lot of good content, no surprise they take up 33% of bandwidth from 9pm to 12am",Neutral
1132,That's not surprising! Netflix and Youtube combined make up half of internet traffic. I don't even have cable anymore because there's so much to watch on Netflix.,Happy
1132," I don't watch much cable either. I do like to watch movies though, Tom Hanks is my favorite actor, he's made over 8.5 billion at the box office",Neutral
1132," Wow, that is awesome! I love Tom Hanks, he has been in so many great movies. I also like Disney films, they are huge and it's odd they have had box office flops before.",Happy
1132," Yea, Treasure Planet did bad, I think it lost Disney like 100 million",Neutral
1132," Wow, I bet they never dreamed that would happen. just like Trojan Wars, it took 15 mill to make and only earned a little over $300....crazy!",Surprised
1132,I've never heard of Trojan Wars but if it's ever in a theater near me I'll add on to the $309,Disgusted
1132," Haha, I haven't heard of it either. But I would go see Silence of the Lambs again if they showed it on valentines day! Back in 1991 that came out and made 270 million haha! A Valetine's Day movie :)",Surprised
1132," Lol, some date. Well I've got to go, nice talking with you.",Neutral
1133,Humans domesticated horses around 4000 BC,Neutral
1133,What I find interesting is that only the Przewalksi horse is the only true wild horse today.  Other wild horses like those on Tangier Island in Virginia and out west are feral horses descended from domesticated horses.,Curious to dive deeper
1133," There is a whole lot about horses that a true horse lover would know. Me, I know they are bigger than me.  I always thought dogs and horsed did not get along.",Neutral
1133," I have an Appalousa mare and she works very well with the dogs when we are tending to the herd.  So I think that once they learn about each other, they can bond as a team.  What I did not know is that Icelandic horses have a fifth speed, tolt.  I wonder if that is training or if it is genetic?",Curious to dive deeper
1133,Good question.  I imagine any horse could be trained to do it.  The amount of training in a Lipizzaner horse is amazing.,Neutral
1133,Their choregraphed performances are truly amazing.  But I did not know that they are born black/brown and then slowly turn white over a 6 year period.,Surprised
1133,I think most animals start light and go dark with time.  Dalmatians ran ahead of the wagon and barked at people clearing a path.  The dog guessed about the route.,Neutral
1133," I'm not quite sure about that.  My horse is 10 years old and still has the same mottled pattern.  My old dog is showing a little more white around the nose, but he is 17 years old, so he has earned the right to start graying a little.  Did you hear about the two students who got suspended for riding horses to school on a ""no vehicle to school day""?  Hilarious!",Curious to dive deeper
1133,The day must have been a protest about something.  These two followed the spirit of the protest.  To my way of thinking.,Neutral
1133," I guess.  Why horses are a mode of transportation, they are typically not considered a ""vehicle"".  But, not long ago, it was not uncommon to read about a small town drunk who lost his driver's licenses and then rode their horse drunk and got arrested again for ""operating under the influence"".  Horses today tend to be more a hobby with fewer and fewer working horses.  I still like riding my horse though many others have switched to ATVs.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1133," I have some allergies, but nothing that effect my work.  Clint Eastwood got unlucky.",Neutral
1133," True.  Do you think Clint still collects royalties on his old movies?  Many are on streaming services, like Netflix.",Curious to dive deeper
1133," I would think that Clint still collects.  I am sure netflix represents opportunity to make money for him. I was miserable with allergies that day, I deserve it...",Neutral
1133,I have been a Netflix subscriber since 1999 and have re-watched many Clint Eastwood westerns.  Did you know Reed Hastings got the idea to start Netflix after a $40 late fee on a VHS tape of Apollo 13?,Curious to dive deeper
1133," Yes, it was a great idea whose time had come.  Blockbuster would have been smart to buy netflix.",Neutral
1133," True.  I read in the news yesterday that only one Blockbuster store remains in Big Bend, Oregon.  So, they really messed up with not buying Netflix. Did you know that Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than internet bandwidth.  I would have thought postage would have been less considering more people are streaming and very few still use the DVD mail service.",Curious to dive deeper
1133,this little bit of info could have been written in 2012.  some shows like game of thrones are only available by mail.  band width is cheap I guess.,Surprised
1133," Do you go much to the movie theater for the big screen experience or primarily stream?  For me, its a 40 mile drive to go to the theater so Netflix has provided more opportunities to watch movies I would not have driven 40 miles for.  With streaming, the definition of ""box office sales"" has also expanded to include all means of viewing a movie.",Curious to dive deeper
1133,Movie theaters are sad experience at times.  I want popcorn and a pause button.  Home is much better. Tom Hanks is the man.,Neutral
1133,It seems that movie theaters are not all that well cleaned / maintained and the cost of the concession snacks is exorbitant!  What surprised me was that Disney considered closing down animations after Sleeping Beauty flopped.  That would have been an awful mistake considering the number of animated successes they have had recently in addition to their acquisition of Lucas and Pixar!,Surprised
1133,there seems to be risk in making movies.  trojan wars lost  a lot.  the problem with popular movies in a theater is the other people. ha.good day.,Neutral
1134,Hey there do you ever travel? I travel for work all the time I usually take the airplane,Curious to dive deeper
1134," Hello there, I don't as much as I would like to.  That must be very interesting as part of your job. ",Curious to dive deeper
1134,Thank you it is interesting. Would you ride a bus that can drive at 160 miles per hour. That seems really crazy,Surprised
1134," I don't think I would want to travel that fast on 4 wheels, but sounds very interesting. ",Curious to dive deeper
1134,I agree with you. Have you ever been to Japan? I guess all their highways are actually toll roads that sounds really annoying,Surprised
1134," No, but I would love to go one day!  That does sound annoying, but, I heard that the roads are in excellent condition. ",Curious to dive deeper
1134,That makes sense. The roads are nice but it still would cost about $300 to travel across the country like I said they are all toll roads,Surprised
1134,That is quite a bit and on top of all the gas you would have to spend as well.,Curious to dive deeper
1134,You're right. Do you know the first came to travel around the world was. It was the king of Hawaii! At least he didn't have to pay for gas,Surprised
1134," Wow, that is so interesting, I wonder what he all thought on that first trip. ",Curious to dive deeper
1134,I know right. Have you ever been to Iceland? I guess they mostly use airplanes and not cars when they travel between different cities,Surprised
1134," No I haven't, a close friend of mine has and the pictures were incredible!",Curious to dive deeper
1134,That's really cool. I wish I could see them. Have you ever been to Mackinac Island in Michigan?,Curious to dive deeper
1134," I have actually, I am from Wisconsin, so I have traveled to Michigan a few times.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1134,Yes I've been there. I don't like it because I'm allergic to horses and it the whole island to me smells like horse poop haha,Surprised
1134," Lol, that is true, it does have a distinct smell.  I also have really bad allergies but mostly to inside stuff. ",Curious to dive deeper
1134,Haha. Do you ever use Google for your searches? I personally use Bing,Curious to dive deeper
1134,Yeah I think I use google most of the time.  Did you hear about them using goats?,Curious to dive deeper
1134,Yes they use them to cut their grass apparently haha. Maybe I should get a pet goat and it can cut my grass haha.,Surprised
1134," Yeah I think that is pretty cool, but don't know how well it would actually work. ",Curious to dive deeper
1134,Well maybe I'll try it haha. I guess Google what down for about 5 minutes back in 2013 and they took down 40% of all web traffic. That's insane,Surprised
1134," Yeah that just boggles my mind how big it is now.  Well it was nice talking with you today, I hope you have a good one. ",Happy
1135," did you know that starship troopers is on the reading list of several military branches? I saw the movie, it is definitely not pro military haha",Curious to dive deeper
1135," I didnt know it was a book as well, I did watch the movie, thought it was pretty good makes sense the milatary has interest in study it though",Angry
1135," ya, do you read a lot of books? I can't say that I do, I have tried speed reading and I don't retain any of the information when I do that",Curious to dive deeper
1135," I do, I think im a fast reader or at least I though so until I knew the record for speed reading is 4700 words per minute.",Curious to dive deeper
1135," ya that is a wild amount of words, I would definitely not remember those, I guess Enders Game is also on a lot of military reading lists, now there is another movie I saw that was pretty bad haha",Happy
1135,I know that would be really hard! and I didnt like that movie either.,Curious to dive deeper
1135," I do think it's funny there was a moral panic because so many people were reading in the 1700's, if people read so much these days everyone would think that was awesome!",Surprised
1135," It would be great, people are stuck with there phones now, someimtes they seem like zombies, I miss the days of the great authouts like CS Lewis and Tolkien",Sad
1135," ya apparently they would do competitions on who could go the longest without laughing while reading amateur poetry, imagine if you realized those two authors were reading and laughing at your hard work haha",Happy
1135," How fun, I wish I could compete with them, I bet I would lose like in the first round lol",Curious to dive deeper
1135," haha ya although my poetry is pretty bad they would probably laugh at me, did you know the YMCA invented volleyball, basketball and softball?",Surprised
1135," No, I did not know that, although I am a fan of softball, do you play any of those sports?",Happy
1135," I am really good at volleyball, I like playing that at the beach and in my backyard, not so much the other two, what about yoU?",Curious to dive deeper
1135," I used to play softball in highschool, and wanted to become a pro player, I heard the salary is around 5 or 6 thousand",Curious to dive deeper
1135," oh wow that's it? I guess Jose Canseco has the record for the longest softball hit at 622 feet, that is really impressive",Surprised
1135," I know, that is really impressive! and another interesting fact is that the first sporting event to be broadcasted on ESPN was actually a softball game",Curious to dive deeper
1135," wow that is interesting, and the longest softball game in NCAA history was 31 innings, thats a long time!",Surprised
1135," That sure is a long game, I think that happened back in the 90s, I like softball but that would be a boring game.",Curious to dive deeper
1135," ya that would be boring, I saw that there is a species of jellyfish that is genetically immortal, do you think life would ever get boring if you lived forever?",Curious to dive deeper
1135," I think it would, in order for life to be worth it and to enjoy it to the fullest is that at some point its going to end.",Curious to dive deeper
1135," yes I think so, but I would be fine if they somehow got immortal jellyfish DNA into me so I could live forever haha",Happy
1136," Hello Friend, do you like to do a lot of reading?  Reading is a complex cognitive process of decoding symbols to derive meaning.  It is a form of language processing. ",Curious to dive deeper
1136,I do read some. What about you?,Happy
1136," I have read a lot in my lifetime. I even took speedreading in high school.  Did you know that the  world record for speed reading is held by Anne Jones, with a reading speed of 4,700 words per minute? Now, that's fast.",Curious to dive deeper
1136,Now that's a lot of words!Did you know Starship Troopers is the first sci-fi novel on the reading lists of three of the five US military branches.,Surprised
1136," Yes, I knew that but I've never read that before.  CS Lewis and Tolkien held ""you laugh you lose"" competitions when reading terrible poetry. ",Curious to dive deeper
1136,I bet that sure would have been entertaining to watch.,Surprised
1136," Yeah, and so would have back in the 18th century when there was a ""moral panic"" because of the spread of the reading of novels. Wow.",Curious to dive deeper
1136," It sure is crazy to think how people used to live and think. It's hard to believe people that could have been so narrow minded could do things like create games, one example being softball. It was invented in Chicago in 1887.",Happy
1136," Yes, very interesting. Softball moves at a faster pace than traditional baseball and there is less time for the base runner to get to first while the opponent fields the ball.  Yet, the fielder has less time to first while the opponent is running down to first base.",Curious to dive deeper
1136,And to think it is mostly women playing! As of 2014 the average salary for a pro SB player ws between 5-6k,Surprised
1136," Yes, and as of 1991, Creighton hosed Utah in the longest softball game in NCAA history, lasing 31 innings.",Curious to dive deeper
1136,Are you kidding? I wonder how many hours long that was. I sure would not want to sit through that!,Surprised
1136," Me either.  Did you know that the YMCA invented volleyball, softball, and basketball?",Curious to dive deeper
1136," Really, that surprises me. I am shocked that the first sporting  event shown on ESPN was a slow pitch softball game",Surprised
1136," Add to that, Jose Canseco claims to hold the record for the longest softball homerun at 622 feet.",Curious to dive deeper
1136,Holy cow that is one heck of a hit! The name softball came about because the ball used to be soft. Not anymore!,Curious to dive deeper
1136,Ouch. Do you like fish?  Did you know that the black swallower fish can eat prey twice its own length and ten times its weight?,Curious to dive deeper
1136,I find them fascinating. Did you know the seahorse is the only fish to have no neck?,Curious to dive deeper
1136," No, they are the only fish to have a neck.  Did you know that fresh water fish only ""drink"" water through their skin via osmosis, while salt water fish also drink water through their mouths?",Curious to dive deeper
1136,I wonder what it looks like for fish to actually drink while in water? Did you know that there is a jellyfish that is immortal?,Surprised
1136," Yes, I've heard that.  Did you know that 84% of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish?",Curious to dive deeper
1136,Ew. That is really weird! Good chatting!,Happy
1137,I did not know Evangeline Lilly was The Wasp!,Neutral
1137," Oh, man. is she pretty. i need to watch that film. isnt she canadian?",Neutral
1137,I believe so. I really like Paul Rudd for ant man. He is a good action star!,Happy
1137," He is good for superhero films. he is also good at comedy. I dont usually see superhero films, but i like humorous ones.",Neutral
1137,Have you seen the movie the Thor: Ragnarok'? It was hard to understand.,Happy
1137,I have not. again. i dont usually watch the superhero films. the casting for the thor character seems good.,Neutral
1137,Im thinking back to the old nintendo. Japan kept selling them until 2003. It was so popular at its time.,Neutral
1137," I never owned one, but my friends did. they loved the NES.",Neutral
1137,I was in love with that system growing up.The story telling from the games as a kid can really broaden your imagination.  nintendo came out with great games. My favorite was Zelda.,Curious to dive deeper
1137,I played the gameboy for a bit. it was a pretty good system. good games.,Neutral
1137,It is hard to believe that Bill Nye has gotten famous off of a Steve Martin look a like contest lol,Happy
1137," I dont see the resemblance, but i guess he had great makeup. the guy is great with audiences.",Neutral
1137,Yes he has made quite a career out of his luck. I used to watch his shows back in the day.,Curious to dive deeper
1137,I heard him on the radio from time to time. interesting guy. he was an adviser on the movie flubber.,Neutral
1137,Yes Bill Nye was just recently on a podcast with Elon Musk and Neal Degrassi Tyson. Speaking about mars.That guy Elon Musk might save the world.,Curious to dive deeper
1137,I hope we get more people like him. smart and ambitious. I wish I had been one of those. He is not greedy either.,Neutral
1137,Sony is regretting the rights to marvel. They would be making so much more money. Luckily for marvel they didnt hand it over.,Curious to dive deeper
1137," Yeah, Sony did not know the potential of the other characters. they focused on one and could have had a bounty.",Neutral
1137,Its crazy to think that the big marvel characters dont associate with disney. It was a good move by marvel again.,Neutral
1137," Yeah, they developed those characters over decades. the following was huge. Anyway, good chat!",Neutral
1137,Yes likewise. Goodnight!,Neutral
1137,Have a good night!,Neutral
1137,Alright. I think I may go watch that Ant Man now,Neutral
1137,That is a great idea! Enjoy Ms. Lilly.,Neutral
1137,surely will. I definitely have to check that out!,Neutral
1137,Bye!,Neutral
1137,Yeah it seems like this is not ending too well.,Neutral
1138,Hello there. Do you enjoy the comedy genre? I love it because the main emphasis is on humor and I like to laugh.,Curious to dive deeper
1138,I love comedies!,Happy
1138," Very cool. Another reason I like this genre is because the films typically have a happy ending, that is unless you're watching a black comedy.",Happy
1138,Yes!  Do you know who Demetri Martin is?,Happy
1138,Yeah he's a funny comedian. He sounds like he was a smart guy to be excepted into Harvard law and everything. You a fan of Bill Murray?,Surprised
1138,I love Bill Murray!,Happy
1138," Awesome me too. He recommends watching kung fu hustle, have you seen it?",Curious to dive deeper
1138,I have not seen that.  I saw that he calls i the supreme achievement of the modern comedy age.,Happy
1138,Yes exactly. So I'm thinking maybe I should add that to my watchlist. Sounds like it could be funny.,Surprised
1138,I agree.  Did you ever watch 3rd rock from the sun?,Happy
1138,Never have but seeing how it won a Golden Globe in 1997 makes me want to watch it too.,Curious to dive deeper
1138," I was surprised that it beat out Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier that year to win it.",Happy
1138,Yes that really shows how good it must've been. The comedy guy Ryan Stiles dropped out of high school to pursue comedy. Definitely paid off for him.,Happy
1138,No doubt.  Big risk he took.  Do you like bromatic comedies?,Happy
1138,Yes very true. Bromantic comedies are hilarious. The hangover and pineapple express are definitely some of my favorites.,Happy
1138,I love those movies!  Do you like dogs?,Curious to dive deeper
1138,Yes dogs are definitely one of my favorite pets. I think it's so cool that they originated from wolves.,Happy
1138,Yes!  Did you know that dogs aren't color blind...they just can't see as many different colors as humans.,Happy
1138,I always thought they were colorblind. Another interesting fact is that there are 12 different blood types that a dog may have.,Surprised
1138,I find it funny that they also have blood drives. lol,Happy
1138,Very funny ha ha. I also love dogs because they are man's best friend. Well so good talking to you today I hope you enjoy the rest of the day!,Happy
1138,You have a good day as well!  Thanks for the chat!,Happy
1139," I knew dalmatians were a traditional firehouse dog, but I never realized that it was because they calmed horses.",Curious to dive deeper
1139,They are great dogs and very pretty. Dogs were the first species to be domesticated.,Curious to dive deeper
1139," Yeah. I always just assumed that existing wolf species were their ancestors, but apparently their ancestors are extinct now.",Neutral
1139,Dogs are my favorite animal. Maybe it is because they can perform many roles for us humans.,Curious to dive deeper
1139," I like dogs, but cats are my favorites. I did consider getting some kind of earth dog breed at one time, to keep down the groundhogs and other critters that eat my garden.",Neutral
1139," Cats are ok too but dogs are ""man's best friend.""",Curious to dive deeper
1139," Well they've been domesticated a lot longer, so that's probably why.",Neutral
1139," True, it seems Google prefers dogs to cats. They say that specifically in their code of conduct. I was not aware of that!",Curious to dive deeper
1139,Same! Really weird to include that in a code of conduct.,Surprised
1139," Yeah I agree. Though dogs can do a lot for humans, they can't see as many colors as humans but they are not color blind.",Curious to dive deeper
1139," I'm not even sure what's meant by color-blind. Even in humans, it just means people see red and green as the same color, not that they don't see color at all.",Curious to dive deeper
1139,Makes sense. Surprisingly dogs and ELEPHANTS are the only animals that seem to understand pointing. I'm not sure I believe that.,Curious to dive deeper
1139,I didn't realize even dogs understood that. I thought they just looked at your finger.,Surprised
1139,Yeah I never even paid much attention to that. I've only had a dog once and for a short time. Did you know dogs can donate blood?,Curious to dive deeper
1139," I figured they must, since sometimes vets have to give transfusions. I didn't realize they had so many blood types though.",Surprised
1139,Yeah 12 seems like a lot. Course I'm not sure how many blood types humans have.,Curious to dive deeper
1139," Just fewer than that, apparently. It must make things pretty complicated tracking and storing so many.",Curious to dive deeper
1139,Humans started domesticating horses in 4000BC. I wonder if that was before they started domesticating dogs.,Curious to dive deeper
1139,I think dogs have been domesticated for tens of thousands of years.,Neutral
1139,I think wild horses are beautiful. Apparently the endangered Przewalski is the only remaining true wild horse.,Curious to dive deeper
1139,I should google an image of it. Nice chatting with you.,Curious to dive deeper
1140," Do you like animals? I love them. I have dogs, but I also love horses. I love that my dogs can understand where I point. Evidently only dogs and elephants are the only animals that can understand a human's point. ",Happy
1140," I do. I love horses. Especially the Lipizzaner, it takes them 6 years to turn white.",Curious to dive deeper
1140," That's so cool. Can you believe two students were suspended because they rode their horses to a ""no vehicles"" day at school?",Neutral
1140,That is crazy! Clint Eastwood had a mid-life allergy to horses develop.,Neutral
1140,That would be such a bummer. I would just get a lot of allergy shots and take Benedryl! Maybe he just got tired of riding them in his movies so he made up an allergy.,Neutral
1140," Maybe. I love dalmations, and didn't know that they calmed the horses at the firestations.",Neutral
1140,I believe it. Dogs are awesome creatures. Google states they are a dog company in their Code of Conduct.,Neutral
1140," I love dogs. I never knew what a tolt was, until I was reading about Icelandic horses, they basically speedwalk.",Curious to dive deeper
1140,That's some funny imagery. Just like what horses must've looked like 50 million years ago. They evolved from an animal with small toes!,Neutral
1140,That is funny. Dogs can be blood donors to other dogs. I would love to see a doggy blood drive when I give blood.,Curious to dive deeper
1140," Aw, that's so precious. It's a funny myth that dogs can't see color; they can see it, they just can't see as many colors as we do.",Happy
1140," I would love to see the vending machines that they have in Istanbul here. They dispense food and water, for the price of a recycled bottle.",Curious to dive deeper
1140,What a sweet idea! It's always so weird to think they evolved from wolves.,Neutral
1140,That is weird. I like how they can do all of these jobs. K-9's are my favorite.,Curious to dive deeper
1140,I love that they can be used for therapeutic roles; I know I definitely consider my dogs my best friends.,Neutral
1140," Mine are mine as well. I'ts interestning that there is only one true wild horse breed, the Przewalski, I always thought the ones on the islands off of Virginia were feral",Curious to dive deeper
1140,I guess I believe it. We domesticated horses as early as 3000 BC.,Neutral
1140,That doesn't seem like that long ago. Were you aware of Demetri Martin giving up law school to become a comedian?,Curious to dive deeper
1140," I wonder if he thinks that's worked out for him. Ryan Stiles also missed out on an education to pursue comedy, but he dropped out of high school not Harvard!",Neutral
1140," I guess it works for them. I used to love 3rd Rock from the Sun, and was happy to learn that it won golden globe for comedy, beating Seinfield & Frasier....I never thought they were funny",Surprised
1140," They also beat Friends! I liked Friends a lot, too. Do you like ""bromantic comedies""? It's the genre that includes Harold and Kumar and Pineapple Express. I also referred to those as ""stoner comedies"", myself.",Neutral
1141," Hey how are you, you ever listen to audiobooks?",Curious to dive deeper
1141,hi how are you? i have in the past. sometimes they are quite entertaining.,Neutral
1141," For sure, there are a lot of good ones. It's nice to listen to them on a summer vacation or something because there is not much reading to do.",Curious to dive deeper
1141," yes, you can listen to them in the car on the way to work, or lie back on the beach with headphones.",Neutral
1141," For sure, I bet Andrew Sean Greer's book that won the pulitizer prize would be fun to listen to, ever hear about it?",Curious to dive deeper
1141," No i havent. By the way, do you like horses or dogs?",Neutral
1141," I do, dogs are awesome. I love my dog more than most humans, what about you? I should apply for a job at Google, they have it in their code of conduct that they are a dog company.",Curious to dive deeper
1141," yes, google made the right choice. dogs are a great addition to an office environment. they relieve stress",Neutral
1141," For sure, did you know they have 12 different types of blood for transfusions? I bet that gets complicated!",Curious to dive deeper
1141," yes, i have never had a dog. i wonder what blood type is the most common.",Neutral
1141," I'm not sure, I might take my dog to one of those blood drives and get him to donate some blood. Does your dog understand pointing?",Curious to dive deeper
1141,yes. dogs and elephants are good at understanding pointing. i would like a pet elephant too,Neutral
1141," That would be awesome to have a pet elephant. Would you rather have an elephant the size of a dog, or a dog the size of an elephant?",Curious to dive deeper
1141," dog sized. good for playing fetch. maybe couldnt ride it like a horse, but thats ok.",Neutral
1141," Horses are pretty cool, but not as cool as the dogs. Icelandic horses have a fifth speed, it's like powerwalking.",Curious to dive deeper
1141,i bet dogs have different speeds too. i wonder if horses have different blood types.,Neutral
1141," That would be interesting to find out. At the old fire stations they had dogs and horses, horses to take the firefighters were they needed to go and the dalmations to keep the horses in check.",Curious to dive deeper
1141,i think that dalmatians are often deaf and not bothered by the sirens. not sure though. dont need them now.,Neutral
1141," Oh really, I would have never thought about that. It'd be so cool to have a bunch of dogs at the fire house.",Curious to dive deeper
1141," Yeah, dogs and firehouses go together like dogs and google. anway, great chat!",Neutral
1141," For sure, take care and great chatting with you too. Have a good rest of the evening!",Happy
1142," hi,do you like Marvel?",Curious to dive deeper
1142," Yes, I do like the films that are produced by Marvel, though embarrassingly, I get DC comics and Marvel comics confused. Do you enjoy it?",Curious to dive deeper
1142," I get them confused too, but as long as I enjoy the movies I do not feel too bad",Curious to dive deeper
1142,Do you have a favorite movie or character from the franchise? I enjoy everyone in the Avengers series.,Curious to dive deeper
1142," I do not have a particular one, a few I would say. you?",Curious to dive deeper
1142," I enjoy all the characters in the Avengers series like Iron Man, Spider Man, Ant Man, oh my, I realized they're all males! Surprisingly, Disney doesn't own the rights to these characters in theme parks because of a contract signed with Universal studios in the 90s.",Surprised
1142," that is amazing, they were smart enough to do that back then. good for them",Curious to dive deeper
1142," It's no wonder they're successful because the created a superhero named ""Blue Ear"" for a four year old boy who told his mom that superheroes don't wear hearing aids, so Marvel created one, how commendable.",Happy
1142," that is just hear warming, so amazing. and once they argued in court that mutants are not humans",Curious to dive deeper
1142," I'm not sure whether I agree or disagree with whether or not mutants aren't humans. Anyways, its still a form of entertainment though because it captures and holds the attention of interested audiences.",Happy
1142,yeah that is for sure. did you know sony passed on the opportunity to buy all the character's rights?,Curious to dive deeper
1142," Oh wow, Sony had an opportunity to buy them but missed out on it. I'm quite surprised because I know that cosplay is really big in Japan, I wonder how much they regret it, how come they passed on that opportunity for a great investment?",Curious to dive deeper
1142,They though only spiderman was going to be popular so they bought the rights to it only,Curious to dive deeper
1142," You can pick and choose? Well, I wonder which character is the most profitable out of all of them. My guess is Thor because the film stars many notable actors and actresses like Natalie Portman, Chris Hemsworth, Idris Elba, etc.",Curious to dive deeper
1142," I am not sure, I think Black Panther",Curious to dive deeper
1142,I also like Black Panther as well. 80% of the dialogue was improvised! I don't think I could stop myself from giggling if I was to speak in a made up language.,Happy
1142," I knowww, that is crazy. have you seen antman?",Curious to dive deeper
1142," No I have not seen Ant Man, is it worth the time?",Curious to dive deeper
1142,I have not see it either but apparently it made the debut in other comic movies,Curious to dive deeper
1142," Yeah, I did see it in the Avengers. They did receive great movies on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, do you trust those reviews or use it as a resource?",Curious to dive deeper
1142," I am not sure, I think it boils down to personal preference. nice chat",Happy
1143,Do you like to fish?  I love going to aquariums.,Curious to dive deeper
1143,Hey there!  I do like to fish and aquariums!  I live in Florida so I get to do a lot of fishing.,Happy
1143,Neat!  You have some exotic species down there not found around the rest of the US.,Happy
1143," Yes, there are a lot of interesting and scary species.  We have a lot of jellyfish which scare me.  There is actually a breed that is immortal!",Fearful
1143,Yikes!  84 percent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish.  Odd fact.,Happy
1143,That is interesting.  I am curious to know if we have and black swallowers down here.  They can eat prey that weighs 10 times as much as them.,Curious to dive deeper
1143,I wouldn't want to come across those for sure.  lol  I would however like to catch a peacock bass one day.  There is only one fish that has a neck and that is the seahorse!,Happy
1143," I love seeing seahorses in the aquarium.  I learned recently that freshwater fish only drink through osmosis whereas in saltwater, fish can also drink through their mouths.  I wonder why that is? ",Curious to dive deeper
1143,That is interesting.  I'm curious to know.  You think it would be the other way around because of the saltwater.  lol  Do you play softball?,Happy
1143,I have played in a couple beer leagues before.  Did you know that the YMCA invented softball?,Neutral
1143,Those are the best leagues!  I didn't know that.  Jose Canseco claims to have hit the longest softball homerun at 622 feet.,Happy
1143," The YMCA actually invented volleyball and basketball too.  Wow, that is a crazy long ball from Jose!",Surprised
1143,No doubt.  I wonder if that was when he was on steroids? lol  The first sporting event ever shown on ESPN was a slow pitch softball game between the Kentucky Bourbons and the Milwaukee Schlitz.  Ha!  Perfect beer league names!,Happy
1143," Haha, that is funny.  I think beer leagues are the only way to go.  Even for professional softball players, they only make about 5-6k in salary.",Neutral
1143,Nice!  I didn't know there were professional players.  In 1991 Creighton and Utah played the longest NCAA game in history when the game went on for 31 innings.,Happy
1143,They must have been exhausted!  At least softball typically moves at a faster pace than baseball.  That would be like a 10 hour game in baseball.,Neutral
1143,lol you're right.  Do you like to read at all?  I do.,Curious to dive deeper
1143," Yes, I enjoy reading quite a bit.  Funny how about 300 years ago their was a moral panic because people were reading too much!",Surprised
1143," Isn't that crazy?  How about Anne Jones?  She holds the record for speed reading at 4,700 words per minute!",Happy
1143,That is crazy!  I cannot even imagine.  I think that questions the definition of reading as a complex interaction...,Surprised
1143,Yes it does!  Makes you wonder if she actually took in what she read. lol  I had a good time chatting with you today!,Happy
1143," No kidding!  Enjoyed the chat too, have a great day!",Happy
1144,Do you like pomegranate?,Curious to dive deeper
1144,I have not had a lot of pomegranate to know if I like it or not for sure. Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
1144,I like it but it's kind of difficult to get the seeds out for the amount of fruit you get. But they are good for taming inflammation and are good for health in other ways.,Happy
1144,It always did seem like a lot of work. I know they have recently made a big push into the drink scene because of these benefits.,Curious to dive deeper
1144," Yeah, have you tried POM? I always am kind of wary of mass produced juices though.",Curious to dive deeper
1144,I have not tried it because I am not a big juice drinker. I find that they tend to be overly sugary.,Neutral
1144," Right, I agree. I feel that sometimes they don't include the best part of the fruit either.",Curious to dive deeper
1144,Yes I like to have the fiber from the fruit itself as it helps with the amount of sugar you ingest while eating it. You lose that in juices.,Neutral
1144," Right. Some people think separating the pomegranate seeds from the membrane can be therapeutic. Um, I'm not sure about that for me. It just frustrates me and I get bored. Haha.",Surprised
1144," I don't think I would enjoy that. I have always enjoyed the Greek myth about the pomegranate though, are you familiar?",Curious to dive deeper
1144,That sounds vaguely familiar but I am not sure. Pomegranates are supposed to be a mood booster as well.,Surprised
1144," The pomegranate was the symbol of life and marriage in Ancient Greece and because Persephone ate some of Hades seeds, she had to remain in the underworld for part of the year. The myth then says that because she does the goddess of Earth gets sad and that's why we have winter.",Neutral
1144,Interesting! In Ancient Greek mythology there were immortal Gods right? Well there is actually a jellyfish breed that is immoral.,Surprised
1144," They are a very uncomplicated creature, they are mostly water so there isn't a big risk for injury and disease like with humans.",Neutral
1144," Sorry, I mean immortal not immoral haha! Yeah, you're right but it's still a fascinating concept. I like seahorses a lot. They are the only fish to have a neck.",Surprised
1144,The male seahorse also gives birth to and cares for the young.,Neutral
1144,Neat! I would stay away from the black swallower fish. It can eat prey ten times its weight.,Curious to dive deeper
1144," I wonder how big that fish is, I bet it's no match for us or we would have heard about it by now.",Curious to dive deeper
1144,I believe it's a deep sea fish so we never come across it. Have you heard of the zebrafish? It has 84 percent of genes known to be associated with human diseases.,Curious to dive deeper
1144," I have never heard of that fish, I wonder if it's close relation can help us scientifically/",Curious to dive deeper
1144," Right, it might house secrets that we still need to discover.",Surprised
1145,Hi.  do you like politics,Curious to dive deeper
1145,hi there. I am 50/50 on politics,Neutral
1145,I see.  do you play piano by any chance,Curious to dive deeper
1145," unfortunately, I do not and you?",Neutral
1145," I play a bit in the past.  Do you know that on 04, 18,1930 the bbc decided to broadcast piano music because no news worth reporting",Surprised
1145," wow...That is interesting. Nowadays, things have changed, they will repeat the news till you are tired of hearing it.",Curious to dive deeper
1145," Exactly.  Hahhaha.  Also, in 2006 some climbers found a piano on the top of Britain's highest mountain",Surprised
1145,wow. do you believe in stars of the zodiac? What is your star?,Curious to dive deeper
1145," In my religion, there is no star.  How about you",Neutral
1145,I read it sometimes for the fun of it.,Neutral
1145,Are you interested in scientific facts about the Earth,Curious to dive deeper
1145," Yes, but I have not invested too much of myself in it. I took an astronomy class in college & I was amazed at how people used to judge time and seasons by using the sun & stars",Happy
1145," Yeah, that is fascinating.  I am still wondering how those scientists carried out such peculiar measurements",Curious to dive deeper
1145," i think people from back in the day were very intelligent & observant, most of us would not last a week without the assistance of technology",Neutral
1145,Exactly.  I believe they had some kind of method or way of figuring things out,Curious to dive deeper
1145,True. Would you be interested in going to Space?,Neutral
1145," no hesitation, if given a chance.  You?",Happy
1145,I do not think I would agree. I would feel trapped in that space ship,Fearful
1145," I see.  Also, did you know that more than 80 percent of our earth's natural forests have already been destroyed",Sad
1145," Oh dear, that is scary!",Sad
1145," I know.  By the way, nice chatting with you.  Have a happy holiday",Neutral
1145,Thank you & same to you,Happy
1145,bye,Happy
1146," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
1146," Hey! I'm doing well, how are you today?",Happy
1146,I am well. Do you like dogs?,Happy
1146,I do! I have 2 golden retrievers. Do you? I just learned that there are actually blood drives for dogs.,Curious to dive deeper
1146,I don't want this to be a downer and I just put my 10 year old st bernard down this week. It was sad but she was great and in a better spot. I had goldens when I was right out of college. I loved that dog!,Happy
1146,Oh my gosh... I can't even begin to imagine. I am so terribly sorry. Dogs are such amazing creatures!!! What was her name?,Sad
1146," Sasha. It's the 3rd dog I have had to put down and although it was emotionally easier this time, I still miss her. My first dog, the golden, I took three days off of work from.",Sad
1146," Sasha is a beautiful name. I'm sure she was very loved over those 10 long years. My 4 year old golden, Lily, is my first dog. I will be absolutely devastated if something happens to her. Do you plan on getting another dog?",Curious to dive deeper
1146," Not for a while. We have a 7 and 5 year old that my wife and I are concentrating on. Plus we always need to find sitters and walkers for her. It only happens once every two months but still, it gets hard. Once my kids go off to college, I will get another one. Plus I am alergic...",Happy
1146," I have a 4 year old and 7 month old golden. They require a lot of attention but its totally worth it. Thankfully I am not allergic, but I do sometimes despise the hair lol. I have yet to have children.",Curious to dive deeper
1146,HA! I remember my golden's hair floating by like tubleweed in the old south. So much hair! I thought my st bernard would have a lot but didn't.,Happy
1146,I am currently watching my wife sweep under the TV stand as tumbleweeds of blonde hair comes rolling out lol. The shedding is aggravating but I couldn't imagine my life without either of them,Curious to dive deeper
1146," Oh no, completely worth it. Especially when you have someone else to clean it up for you!",Happy
1146," No, no haha. I am currently waiting for her to be done so I can go through with the vacuum and dust. We have a pretty good system. Theres an entire puppy worth of hair when we're finished.",Curious to dive deeper
1146," I remember those days. In my golden's 8 years, I think I went through 6 vacuums because of the hair. I loved that dog so much though. What are their names? Lilly and????",Curious to dive deeper
1146,We are on vacuum #2 haha. We also have a roomba we run during the day to get the excess hair we missed. Its crazy! Lily & Ben! I love them like they are my own kids.,Curious to dive deeper
1146,How long have you had your roomba? That thing is going to die soon. The hair will kill the motor...,Curious to dive deeper
1146," I got it as a gift for Christmas, so only about 3 months. I'd give it another 3-4 months before it dies. I did not buy it for a reason haha too much hair for this thing",Fearful
1146,I wanted a roomba but was going to wait until my dog was gone. I can now buy a roomba!,Happy
1146," They are nice to have, especially if you don't have a pet. It gets a pretty decent amount of hair up. It was really nice chatting with you!",Happy
1146,Ditto. Go give those puppies a big hug and kiss!,Happy
1146,Absolutely! Have a good one!!!,Happy
1146,You too,Happy
1147," Do you like instruments? I love the Piano though i can not play it, lol.",Curious to dive deeper
1147,Hi! I like the piano and the guitar although I don't know how to play either haha well I can do mary had a little lamb on the piano but that's it!,Curious to dive deeper
1147," Right me too and chopsticks, well some of it. An aluminum grand piano was built for a lounge of the airship Hindenburg.",Curious to dive deeper
1147," It truly is fascinating and I applaud all those that learn an instrument, Its a great form of expression and healing. even pianos have ""stress testing"" its a song that exists but its not remotely playable by humans, its crazy, I've seen the keys... there is no way a human can play that song! its called circus gallop",Curious to dive deeper
1147,Wow that is interesting! What's more interesting is that the piano aboard the Hindenburg weighed 356 pounds.,Curious to dive deeper
1147," There are a lot of interesting facts surrounding pianos which one of my favorite stories would be when the news had no stories to report and played piano music instead! Makes me wish we could turn on the TV and hear about Peace in the world, and listen to piano music. What a day that would be!",Curious to dive deeper
1147,What a day indeed! Oh yeah that happened back in the 30's right?,Curious to dive deeper
1147," Yes! so long ago! Have you heard the song ""Hey Jude"" by Paul Mccartney? It's one of my all time fav songs played with the piano.",Curious to dive deeper
1147,I don't think i have ever heard that song. did it win any awards?,Curious to dive deeper
1147,I dont think so but it should! I thinks its before my time but its one of my fav oldie songs! What would you do if you climbed the top of the highest mountain and find a piano there? sounds weird right? Its a true story! a mystery...,Curious to dive deeper
1147,Wow wonder how they got it up there? Did you know that building blocks of life were discovered in a planetary system 455 light years away.,Curious to dive deeper
1147," Thats really really far away! How in the world did they discover that. It just amazes me! There is also a planet that ""rolls"" Im getting sick just thinking about living there...blaaah",Curious to dive deeper
1147,Yeah i hear you apparently one of Jupiter's moon's would be considered a planet if it rotated the sun.,Curious to dive deeper
1147," All these planets... Im sure there are other people living somewhere out in the Universe! It would be trippy to meet Aliens though, did you know that when earth was first formed. a Day lasted 5.5 hours long... and i complain about not having enough time in a day!",Curious to dive deeper
1147,Right! Also more than 80% of earths natural forest have been destroyed. That's a lot of oxygen.,Curious to dive deeper
1147," That makes me sad for mother earth! The fascinating thing is that if Earth entire history was reviewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent only a little over a minute... incredible right?",Curious to dive deeper
1147,Very! Wow did you know that we have an official Ambassador to extraterrestrials?,Curious to dive deeper
1147,What?!! No! When did this happen?,Curious to dive deeper
1147,Apparently September of 2010 the United Nation thought it prudent to do so just in case.,Curious to dive deeper
1147," Wow, I would of thought that would of been in place hundreds of years ago when they first did contact... wonder why they waited so long to appoint someone ""publicly""",Curious to dive deeper
1147,Right or they thought we were idiots and didn't want to admit what went on in area 51.,Curious to dive deeper
1147," I know, its right in front of our faces and they still lie and hide it "" its not what it looks like"" in a creepy whisper voice...not in a helium voice apparently helium will no longer be available by the end of the 21st century. Anyway, fun chatting! ",Curious to dive deeper
1148,did you know that unfortunately eighty percent of earth's naturally occuring forests have been eliminated?,Curious to dive deeper
1148," I expect that the next decade or so will show some dramatic changes in the environment. The earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago, but we are changing it quickly ourselves.",Neutral
1148," yes we are, and somehow Earth was made and when that happened a day was only 5.5 hours long, that's a fast day!",Surprised
1148,The work day would be over before you finished commuting. The UN has an ambassador to extra terrestrials. I wonder who ended up with that job.,Neutral
1148," haha ya I want that job, I would imagine you do a whole lot of NOTHING all day long haha",Happy
1148," And who is going to fire you? You can't fail at doing the job. If the aliens need helium to live, they'll have problems pretty soon. We'll be helium free by the end of the century.",Neutral
1148," ya that is scary, do you like piano music at all? I play the piano and it's wild an aluminum grand piano was built for the Hindnburg airship, it only weight 356 pounds, I don't know if you've seen a real piano but they normally weight thousands",Surprised
1148," I wonder about the sound of an aluminum piano. A bit tinny, I would think.",Curious to dive deeper
1148," haha ya I would like to listen to it if only the Hindenburg didn't explode, and apparently on Britains highest moutain someone had put a piano on top of it in 2006 for some reason haha",Surprised
1148,Maybe in case an airship crashed on top of the mountain?,Neutral
1148," haha ya or to have some kind of entertainment when you get to the top? haha, I do like how Freddie Mercury used the same piano used by Paul McCartney though that is cool",Surprised
1148,Have you seen the bio-pic about Freddie? Haven't seen it yet myself. I would like to see somone try to play the tune circus galop for auto-pianos.,Neutral
1148," No I haven't seen it yet but I want to, I've heard a lot of good things, apparently that piano that Freddie used was used by Paul to record the song Hey Jude",Surprised
1148,Seems to be a lot of song-making magic in that piano. I wonder what planet will be the next in the solar system to have a piano.,Neutral
1148,haha yes or we should make a rocket ship to fly pianos around to other planets! they need to be aluminum I'm sure to save on weight haha,Happy
1148," The atmosphere would be different so the sound of the piano would be different, too.",Neutral
1148," do you play any instruments? I know that Venus spins clock wise and is the only planet to do so, I wonder if that would affect my piano playing haha",Surprised
1148,The lack of seasons on Venus might affect inspiration for songs.,Neutral
1148," yes you would have a lot less to sing about if the weather is always the same, aka bad! you'd always be in a bad mood haha",Curious to dive deeper
1148,The building blocks of life have been detected in a aystem 455 light-years away. Maybe music would help life develop there.,Neutral
1148,yes that is true! I wonder if aliens would develop a piano or come up with a whole new instrument! I want to go to their rock concerts with all their alien music haha,Curious to dive deeper
1148," Sounds like fun! Well, I enjoyed chatting!",Happy
1148,thank you my friend perhaps we will meet these aliens someday!,Happy
1149," Hello , How are you doing.",Neutral
1149," Hello there, I am well thank you.  Do you watch much basketball?",Curious to dive deeper
1149,Yeah I do sometimes. Mostly in the playoffs. I havent really watched much this year though.,Curious to dive deeper
1149," I mostly just follow my local team, which has been really good this season so far, they are best in the league. ",Curious to dive deeper
1149," Oh yeah, college or pros. Were you aware that the only head coach in kansas University history with a losing record is james naismith. The inventor of basketball.",Happy
1149," Wow, that is a very impressive program.  I wonder what Mr. Naismith would think of the game today?",Curious to dive deeper
1149,I would say he would be surprised at the athletic ability of the players these days. I doubt this is what he really imagined. Not to say he would be disappointed.,Happy
1149,Yeah I think he would be most impressed by the amount and style of dunking that happens today.,Curious to dive deeper
1149,I know it impresses me a lot. Another fun fact is that in 39 out of the 50 states. The highest played employee is a college football or basketball coach. Thats just crazy.,Happy
1149," That is crazy, not to say that those jobs aren't important but that just blows my mind. ",Curious to dive deeper
1149," Yeah mine to. I have always like playing basketball. Never been great at it , but I enjoy playing. ",Happy
1149,Yeah that used to be my go to sport when I was a kid.  I used to tape all of the dunk contests.  I used to love Larry Johnson and Shawn Kemp.,Curious to dive deeper
1149,A hornets fan huh. I liked the heat when I was a kid. I liked that crossover Tim Hardaway did. Until Allen Iverson came to the league then he was my favorite.,Curious to dive deeper
1149," Heck yeah Tim Hardaway was awesome, I remember watching him on the Warriors.  Iverson was awesome too, he got the best of my team back in 2001, but, I think we will be back there this year. ",Curious to dive deeper
1149,I haven't really followed it much this year. Are they doing pretty well.,Happy
1149," Yeah the Bucks, they are first place in the whole league, I really hope we can make the finals, I have never seen it in my lifetime. ",Curious to dive deeper
1149," Yeah Giannis is pretty good. i think he is better than Lebron, at least at this stage in their careers.",Happy
1149," Yeah Giannis has been a diamond in the rough and turned this franchise around since he has been here.  I like Lebron, he has done so much, but I think it's Giannis's time. ",Curious to dive deeper
1149," I think Lebron is a great player, I just hate it how he has done cleveland. I think he should have stayed there his whole career and brought them a bunch of championships. It would have been a great story.",Happy
1149," Yeah if he would've done like Dirk and the Mavs, imagine how many titles, and yeah we would've gone down as Clevelands biggest hero. ",Curious to dive deeper
1149," It is kind of sad what he has done. He basically said forget my hometown, just to go get a couple more championships that he probably could have got anyway.",Happy
1149," Yeah I don't like when players leave a team just to get a ring.  If you want to do it right, play for one team, and do enough to make it happen while you're there. It was nice talking with you today, I hope you have a good day.",Happy
1150," Hello,how are you this evening? Do you like sports? ",Curious to dive deeper
1150," Im great, and yeah I do like to watch sports, basketball, hockey, soccer and even swimming, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1150," I like sports, football, hockey, soccer I also find swimming interesting as well.",Curious to dive deeper
1150," You like swimming too? nice, then you must know Michael Phelps",Curious to dive deeper
1150," Yes, I enjoy watching the Olympics and have seen quiet a few of his races. Did you know that there is a type of swimming where the swimmer has their hands and legs bound and they swim like a dolphin?",Surprised
1150," I didnt know that, and yeah he kills it at the olympics in fact he has more gold medals than 80% of the countries in the history of the games",Curious to dive deeper
1150," Wow,incredible! I know that the US has almost as many gold medals in swimming as the rest of the world combined. ",Surprised
1150," That is a lot, well if Phelps has more than 80% of the countries it makes sense, we have great athletes in our country",Curious to dive deeper
1150," I agree, it is incredible to witness them doing their best, and then beating. Always improving. Did you now that Cornell requires all students to pass a basic swimming test before they can graduate?",Curious to dive deeper
1150,No I didnt know that but I think thats a great thing that gets kids prepared for an emergency,Surprised
1150,Did you know when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was is college his overuse of the slam dunk caused it to be banned for over a decade?,Surprised
1150," Oh so he was the one that got the move banned from college, I sure missed it, good thing its not banned anymore",Curious to dive deeper
1150,Another basketball fact is that the inventor of basketball James Naismith is the only losing coach in the University of Kansas's history.,Neutral
1150," He is the only losing coach?lol that is ironic, how can that be!!!",Surprised
1150,Right? Did you know that college football or basketball coaches are the highest paid state employees in 39 out of 50 states?,Surprised
1150," I didnt know that, thats interesting, I guess the rest of the public employees are underpaid, you know that vasectomy rates increases during March",Curious to dive deeper
1150," Wow crazy. There is a basketball court on the top floor of the Supreme court building? They call it ""the highest court in the land"" lol.",Surprised
1150," The highest court in the land! what a nice name, I wonder what kinds of competitions they have there, maybe a tournament between judges and convicted felons lol",Curious to dive deeper
1150,Lol. Did you know that in a Pro hockey game a player will lose up to 8 pounds in one game?,Surprised
1150," 8 pounds really? I guess I need to learn to play hockey, that way I can loose weight fast lol",Curious to dive deeper
1150," I guess, lol. It's a hard game. It's been nice chatting with you.",Surprised
1150," It is a hard game, our olympic team lost to a highschool team once, that must had sting.",Curious to dive deeper
1151," Hi, do you like swimming ?",Curious to dive deeper
1151," I like how good of an exercise it is, and it's fun for recreation",Happy
1151," Yes, I love swimming. Did you know that there's a type of competitive swimming where the athlete has their hands and legs bound, and swims like a dolphin?",Curious to dive deeper
1151,That would take a lot of core strength! The front crawl still seems to be the fastest though. We can thanks the Native Americans for showing that to the British,Neutral
1151," Yes, and all Cornell University student must pass a basic swimming test before they're allowed to graduate.",Curious to dive deeper
1151," I think that's a good thing. Americans seem to do well at swimming, considering we have more gold medals than the other nations combined",Neutral
1151," Yes, they get famous in our country, too. Speaking of the Olympics, did you know that there's a banned swimsuit so good that 94% of all swimming races in the 2008 Olympics were won in it?",Curious to dive deeper
1151,I wonder what it's made of that they would ban it like that?,Neutral
1151," Not sure but as a formalized sport, swimming features a range of local, national, and international competitions. Also, it's consistently among to top public recreational activities.",Curious to dive deeper
1151," I wonder if it's popular in Canada, or if they prefer playing ice hockey considering how much colder it is",Curious to dive deeper
1151,They probably would rather play hockey in Canada since hockey is one of the two national sports there with the other being Lacrosse.,Curious to dive deeper
1151," Ice hockey in the winter and lacrosse in the summer. On average, a professional hockey player loses about 8 pounds, so it must be good exercise",Neutral
1151,No doubt. There was a hockey player that was traded for $1 in 1993 and went on to win four Stanley cups.,Curious to dive deeper
1151,That was definitely a steal for whatever team got him! I guess it happens in every sport,Surprised
1151,Probably so true. Did you know that an ice hockey ring remains under a basketball court when switching stadium sports? I didn't realize that one.,Curious to dive deeper
1151,It makes sense though to utilize the space for more than one sport. Both are popular in other countries,Neutral
1151," Yes, I agree.  Did you know that in 1924, in the first Olympic winter games, Canada scored 132 goals and let in 3 in the entire ice hockey competition?",Curious to dive deeper
1151," No wonder it's a national sport. I've never heard of bandy, but apparently it's a type of hockey",Neutral
1151," Yes, and field hockey as well as what we've been chatting about, ice hockey.  In most of the world, hockey refers to field hockey.",Curious to dive deeper
1151," But it seems the basics are the same, no matter the arena it's played in",Neutral
1151," Yes, that is true, hockey is a sport in which two teams play against each other by trying to manoeurvre a ball or a puck into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick.",Curious to dive deeper
1152,Basketball is a great sport do you follow it?,Curious to dive deeper
1152," Hi! Yes I love basketball but I don't have a favorite team in particular, do you?",Curious to dive deeper
1152," I like the Mets but Im not a big fan either, I just think they have a great team and like how they play",Curious to dive deeper
1152," Yeah, they're a good team, don't have a favorite in particular on that team but I'm sure the coach is one of the highest paid employees like other college football and basketball coaches.",Surprised
1152," I always thought players earned a higher salary I was shocked to learn that as well, apparently in 39 out of 50 states this is the case",Curious to dive deeper
1152," I think players do earn a higher salary because I think that statement refers to college players and coaches and I don't think students can earn money for being on the team, they get paid in the form of scholarships, I suppose.",Curious to dive deeper
1152," Oh I see, that makes a lot more sense, Basketball is so popular the Supreme Court has a court on one of its floors.",Curious to dive deeper
1152," I wonder if any of the supreme court justices play, probably the aides play since I imagine the justices are much older",Curious to dive deeper
1152," Thats an interesting question, I bet some of them are on the team, maybe on the bench, there is a team called Tall Blacks or well at least thats their nickname, ",Curious to dive deeper
1152,Do you know what the reason is for a nickname like that?,Curious to dive deeper
1152," Not sure, possibly because of the height of the players and the tone of their skins, the team is from New Zealand",Curious to dive deeper
1152," Yeah, I find that a little odd. I wonder if they have a swim team and what the nickname is for them, maybe dolphins because there is a type of competitive swimming where the athletes have their limbs bounded and have to swim like dolphins!",Surprised
1152," I havent heard of that before but who knows maybe there is, you know that the US has more Gold medals than almost the rest of the world combined",Curious to dive deeper
1152,combined?! Is that only for swimming only or for all sports combined?,Curious to dive deeper
1152," Thats only for swimming and it makes sense, the US have great swimmers, Michael Phelps is one of them",Curious to dive deeper
1152," Yeah, I really enjoy watching the swim competitions when it comes time for the olympics. Don't really enjoy hockey quite as much, maybe the only entertaining one was when Canada scored 132 goals in one game in 1924.",Surprised
1152," That was a long time ago lol, I bet the other team didnt have a goalie, and you might not like it that much but it sure is a great way to exercise, players lose about 8 pounds per game",Curious to dive deeper
1152,I would probably lose more than 8 pounds from the constant falling and slipping and lack of hand eye coordination and struggle in the frigid temperatures.,Happy
1152," Its a tough sport to play indeed, back in 1993 a player was traded for only $1, that player then won 4 Stanley Cups",Surprised
1152," What a bad investment decision! Way to stick it to them! I think I'd be a little discouraged if that happened to me, wouldn't you?",Sad
1152," They definitely meant it as a joke and a way to humilliate the player, sounds like he showed them what he was made of",Curious to dive deeper
1153,Did you watch the Academy Awards this year?,Curious to dive deeper
1153,I did for a little bit how about you?,Curious to dive deeper
1153," I did, not all 24 awards but some of them, they have been around for a while a lot of history ",Curious to dive deeper
1153,Didn't they start as a private dinner in 1929? I thought there was more than 24 given it takes forever to get through the show haha.,Curious to dive deeper
1153,Yeah it started out as a small event hosted by Douglas Fairbanks I guess the awards have grown a lot since then.,Curious to dive deeper
1153," After that, they went to radio in 1930 and then televised for the first time in 1953.",Curious to dive deeper
1153,Do you know who Daniel Day-Lewis is?,Curious to dive deeper
1153,I do! I like him in a bunch of movies! Has he won many oscars?,Curious to dive deeper
1153," He has one the best actor Oscar 3 times, his the only actor to win it that times.",Curious to dive deeper
1153,That is fitting for him! Can you believe the oscars were nominated for 9 emmys in 2013? Must have been a rough year lol.,Surprised
1153,Really? that can happen? an award nominated for another award? lol that is insane.,Surprised
1153,Sounds like the movie Inception lol. I heard that George Lucas's wife has more Oscars than him!,Surprised
1153," Even Eminem has more Oscars than Lucas lol, so that is a soft topic for him. ",Curious to dive deeper
1153,I bet you don't speak of the oscars in front of him haha. Do you watch the NFL at all?,Surprised
1153," Yeah thats a sensible topic indeed lol, I do watch the NFL, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1153,Same here. Did you know it's considered an entertainment business rather than a sport?,Surprised
1153," No first time hearing about that, do you like the Walt Disney Company?",Curious to dive deeper
1153,I do to a point! I didn't know they accept outside ads from companies.,Surprised
1153," I like Disney movies, Big Hero 6 was one of my favorites it required a lot of computing power and I didnt know that either. ",Curious to dive deeper
1153,That is interesting! Did you know they make 1110 dollars per second that is insane! I need to get on that haha. Nice chatting with you!,Curious to dive deeper
1153," That is a lot of money! wow, I would be traveling the world with that much green lol, it was nice chatting with you as well have a great day ",Surprised
1154,Do you like music?,Neutral
1154,I love music!  All styles pretty much!,Happy
1154,I have recently been branching into country music,Neutral
1154,Did you know that the Fender stratocaster guitar was intended for country music?,Happy
1154,I wonder if anyone still uses it for country music,Neutral
1154,They do.  Did you know that country music was previously known as hillbilly music?,Curious to dive deeper
1154,Is there a distinction? I thought it was just a matter of labeling,Neutral
1154,Well...I would say the older country music that was called hillbilly music sounds nothing like the country music of today.  Now country music sounds more like a pop band.,Happy
1154,Really? I never knew there was such a difference,Neutral
1154,Oh yeah!  Country music was originally inspired and derived from celtic music.  That's how the fiddle's became a part of country music.,Happy
1154,I know that ford helped popularize country music since he feared the spread of jazz,Neutral
1154," That is true!  In 1996 NFL players sang along with the current country music stars of that year and they called the album ""NFL Country"".  I wonder if it was any good? ",Curious to dive deeper
1154," I hope so. Even if it wasn't amazing, I'm sure it is a nostalgic memory for some",Neutral
1154,Changing the subject...do you like horses?,Curious to dive deeper
1154," Yes, I uses to ride them as an amateur during my youth",Neutral
1154,Nice!  Did you know that once an Icelandic horse leaves Iceland it can never return?,Curious to dive deeper
1154,Is it some sort of tradition?,Curious to dive deeper
1154,They are native to Iceland and it's a interesting law they created.  Did you know that the length of horse hair is related to the amount of sunlight it gets?,Happy
1154," Wow!? Are horses secretly plants? In any case, thanks for this insightful conversation",Surprised
1154," Did you know that horses, sharks, and orangutans are all ticklish?",Happy
1154," That is an interesting tidbit indeed. Anyway, thanks for chatting.",Neutral
1154,It was my pleasure.  Have a good night!,Happy
1155,Do you like watching the Oscars?,Curious to dive deeper
1155," Yes,  how about u?",Neutral
1155," Yes, I heard they are adding a new category. ",Curious to dive deeper
1155," Yeah i just read that too.  I think thats great,  more opportunity for people to win awards!",Neutral
1155," Yeah, I think it's for best popular film.  They're probably doing it to attract younger viewers. ",Curious to dive deeper
1155," This is funny: Bill nye ""the science guy"" got his break in entertainment by winning a steve martin lookalike contest.",Neutral
1155,He does look like him.,Neutral
1155,Yeah he does.  are you a disney fan?,Neutral
1155," Yes I am, are you?",Curious to dive deeper
1155,Yesss!  Absolutely!  Have you been to Disneyland or world lately?,Neutral
1155," Yes, I was at Disneyland a couple of days ago. When",Neutral
1155,Really?!  Im so jealous!  I was there like 2 months ago.  I got to take a picture with Jack Skellington!  Is the haunted mansion still nightmare before christmas themed?,Happy
1155,Yes it is.  I didn't go in but it was still the same theme.,Neutral
1155," Pixar named ""wall-e"" as a tip of the hat to walter elias disney. Thats an interesting fact.  ",Neutral
1155,That makes sense. Minnie Mouse's real name is Minerva. It doesn't have the same ring.,Neutral
1155,It definitely doesnt have the same ring.  Do you ever look for the hidden Mickeys?,Neutral
1155," No, do you?",Surprised
1155,Not actively.  Sometimes I see them though.  Are you excited for Star wars land?,Neutral
1155,Yes I'm a big Star Wars fan.  Maybe with this new category they'll win an Oscar this year.,Curious to dive deeper
1155," I hope so!  Awesome,  which star wars is your favorite?",Neutral
1155,I liked episode 7.,Neutral
1156,Do you like horses?,Curious to dive deeper
1156," Hi there, I do like horses, but haven't gone riding since I was a young kid.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1156,I do too. Did you know Clint Eastwood is allergic to horses?,Curious to dive deeper
1156," I think I heard about that before, so crazy because how many movies has he starred in where he was on a horse or near them.",Curious to dive deeper
1156," Yeah, I wonder if he has to take anything for that? ",Curious to dive deeper
1156," That is a good point, I'm sure he does.  Did you hear about the high school kids who rode their horses to school?",Curious to dive deeper
1156," Apparently they got suspended, right? ",Curious to dive deeper
1156," Yeah they sure did, I think it was during a 'no vehicles to school day' and they tried to be clever, I think they were. ",Curious to dive deeper
1156,WOW! Poor kids. Did you know that Icelandic horses have a fifth speed?,Curious to dive deeper
1156,I think I heard about that as well.  I wonder what that fifth trot speed looks like?  I'm sure there is a YouTube video out there.,Curious to dive deeper
1156,I heard it is called the tolt.,Curious to dive deeper
1156,Lol!  That is pretty funny.  Do you know the name of the horses who perform classical dressage performances?,Curious to dive deeper
1156,Are they Lipizzaner horses?,Curious to dive deeper
1156," Good call!  Yeah that's the name, but I am curious to see what that all looks like?",Curious to dive deeper
1156," I think they are born black and brown, but then turn completely white. ",Curious to dive deeper
1156," That is amazing, I wonder how and why that happens?",Curious to dive deeper
1156,I'm not sure. Good question. Do you like Fenders?,Curious to dive deeper
1156," I sure do, the Fender Stratocaster is one of the coolest guitars there are, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1156," Yup, I have 3 strats to be honest. I love them, they are super light. Well, nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
1156," Wow!  That is very cool, I bet they are really fun to play too!",Curious to dive deeper
1156,Yeah they are. Well take it easy today!,Curious to dive deeper
1156," Yeah you too, have a good day!",Happy
1157," Hi, do you like swimming?",Curious to dive deeper
1157,I do.  I love watching it in the Olympics!,Neutral
1157,Me too. There is a type of swimming where the swimmer has their hands and legs bound and swim like a dolphin.\,Surprised
1157,That sounds equal parts cool and dangerous.,Surprised
1157,I agree. All Cornell students must pass a basic swimming test before they are allowed to graduate.,Surprised
1157," I am surprised more Florida schools don't have that standard.  The US is pretty strong in swimming, they have more gold medals than the rest of the world combined.",Neutral
1157,That's really good. Native Americans introduced the front crawl swimming stroke.,Surprised
1157,I heard it was to beat the British who only used the Breast Stroke,Neutral
1157,I heard that too. There is a banned swimsuit that is so good that 94% of all swimming races were won with it.,Surprised
1157,That was back in the 2008 Olympics wasnt it.  They were so fast that year!,Neutral
1157," Yep, that was back in 2008. Do you like basketball?",Curious to dive deeper
1157," I watch some, I am excited for the NCAA tournament, you?",Neutral
1157,Me too. I love college basketball and March Madness.,Happy
1157,Abdul-Jabbar was so good at the dunk he got it banned from college hoops.,Neutral
1157,That's interesting that they banned the dunk. Naismith who was the inventor of basketball was the only losing coach in Kansas's history.,Surprised
1157,I cant believe he could lose at the game he created.,Neutral
1157," I know...so sad. In 39 of 50 states, the top paying employee in the state is either a college basketball or football coach.",Surprised
1157,Looks like it is time for me to have a career change.  But on another note that is ridiculous.,Neutral
1157,HAHA. The New Zealand basketball team was nicknamed the Tall Blacks.,Surprised
1157," I am sure there is something behind that name, but in todays climate that sounds a bit racist.",Neutral
1157," I think so too. Well, it was great talking. Have a good day!",Happy
1158,Do you watch the series Daredevil?,Surprised
1158," Actually, I haven't, but I heard the main character is an unconventional superhero.",Neutral
1158,Supposedly the seasons are getting better and better and the third season is a winner.,Curious to dive deeper
1158," I guess the hope is that a series gets better as it goes on, especially in a franchise as big as the Marvel universe that's part of something as huge as Disney.",Neutral
1158,Sony was offered to buy the characters for $25 million but they declined and only bought the rights to Spiderman. Bet they are regretting that now.,Surprised
1158," Yes, that was a poor choice. Apparently due to a contract from the 90s its signed with Universal Studios, even Disney can't use the major Marvel characters in its theme parks east of the Mississippi River.",Neutral
1158,Do you like DC as well? There is one character owned by Marvel and DC. It's only purpose is to keep the universes separate.,Curious to dive deeper
1158,I guess there's a purpose for each character. Marvel even created a superhero just for a 4 year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing hearing aids.,Neutral
1158," That's cool! Blue Ear, right? I just heard about him.",Curious to dive deeper
1158," Superheros really are inspirational, even it's one named ""Normalman"" who's just the only person on a planet of superheroes without superpowers.",Neutral
1158," That actually sounds interesting! I think I'd rather have my kids watch Pet Force though, Garfield as a superhero!",Curious to dive deeper
1158," I wonder what Odie was like in that haha. I guess re-purposing or re-imagining characters is common; Stan Lee, the creator of Marvel, actually wrote 15 DC comics that re-imagined superheroes like Batman and Superman.",Neutral
1158," Interesting! I wonder why. Also, have you heard of real life superheroes? Apparently there is a website where you can register to be a superhero?",Curious to dive deeper
1158," That's interesting, especially since there are over 300 registered (trademarked?) superheroes in the U.S.",Neutral
1158," Yeah, how weird. If there were actual superheroes on earth though would they cause a lot of damage? There was a comic series all about fixing the collateral damage from superheroes.",Curious to dive deeper
1158," I guess that would make a good Netflix show, too; it seems like they'll produce pretty much anything these days.",Neutral
1158," I love the Marvel series on Netflix, more so than the movies.",Happy
1158," You're not alone, apparently; from 9 PM to 12 AM, Netflix accounts for a third of bandwidth use in North America.",Neutral
1158,Yeah I am guilty of using up some of that bandwidth during that time. Surprisingly though Netflix still spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth.,Surprised
1158," Yes, those physical DVDs are hefty haha",Neutral
1158," I used to rent DVDs at Blockbuster, and VHS before that. I bet they regret not taking the offer to buy Netflix!",Surprised
1159,Apparently Canada is the only country with 2 national sports. I wonder how they define what a national sport is.,Curious to dive deeper
1159,okay good.,Happy
1159,Hockey is a good game. I also like basketball. They put the hockey rink under the basketball courts in stadiums.,Neutral
1159,i like hockey game.,Happy
1159," Do you like ice hockey or field hockey? In the U.S. hockey refers to ice hockey, but in most countries saying hockey means field hockey.",Curious to dive deeper
1159,i like ice hockey.are u like?,Happy
1159," I don't watch hockey, but when I think of hockey, I think of ice hockey. Interestingly it has been in the Olympics since 1924.",Neutral
1159,thanks for your information.,Happy
1159," I think football and basketball are more popular than hockey in the U.S.. For example, the highest paid public employees in the majority of our states are coaches for these games.",Neutral
1159,okay.its true,Happy
1159," I don't know how many points a goal is in hockey, but in basketball most shots are worth 2 points. I wonder if they are similar.",Curious to dive deeper
1159," okey.Swimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities,[2][3][4][5] and in some countries, swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum.[6] As a formalized sport, swimming features in a range of local, national, and international competitions, including every modern Summer Olympics.",Happy
1159,It is interesting that babies can even perform movements like swimming with in weeks of birth. It is a very innate and natural sport.,Neutral
1159," yes,are you like swimming?",Happy
1159," I used to swim as a kid. I never did it competitively, even though there are even competitions where swimmers have their hands and legs bound!",Neutral
1159,oh okay,Happy
1159,Can you imagine how they swim like that? Apparently Native Americans were the first to swim using the front crawl. That is interesting.,Surprised
1159,There is a banned swimsuit so good that 94% of all swimming races at the 2008 Olympics wearing one won in it?,Happy
1159," That is amazing. I wonder what the suit is made of. The U.S. has more gold medals than the rest of the whole world, so I wonder if they ever used it.",Curious to dive deeper
1159,Freestyle in swimming technically means you can swim in any style; however the front crawl is synonymous with freestyle since it is the fastest and most efficient stroke.,Happy
1159," That makes sense. I think the butterfly is one of hardest ones, but a Wisconsin swimmer in boys swimming swam it in 49.09. (he was the 3rd fastest though.)",Neutral
1159,okay.thanks for the information.,Happy
1160," Hey! Did you know that there was a hockey player who was traded for $1.00 in 1993, and went on to win 4 Stanley Cups?",Surprised
1160,Wow that's awesome! Such a surprise I bet haha. What is your favorite hockey team?,Curious to dive deeper
1160,The NY Islanders! How about you?,Happy
1160,I really like the Red Wings. I also like the Penguins a lot haha. It's because my dad's from Pittsburgh originally.. Why do you think Canada is so good at hockey?,Curious to dive deeper
1160," That's cool. I'm originally from NY so that explains my preference for the Islanders. Canada is so good at hockey because it is their national sport. They're the only country with 2 national sports,",Surprised
1160,I think you're right there national sports are lacrosse and ice hockey. I guess Hockey is referred in other countries as field hockey. Only in about five countries total is it referred to as just hockey,Surprised
1160,Kind of like football/soccer I guess. On average hockey players can lose up yo 8lbs in one game. I know they must sweat like crazy.,Surprised
1160,Wow that does sound crazy. I could use that that sounds like a great workout though haha. It's interesting that they can use the same court for basketball and hockey and they just switch the floors out,Surprised
1160," Yeah I thought that was wild too, I learned that at an Islanders game because they share the stadium with the Brooklyn Nets. In 39 of 50 states the highest paid state employee is a college football or bball coach.",Surprised
1160,That's interesting I didn't know that. What do you think about Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? I love how he was so good that he got the dunk banned in basketball haha,Surprised
1160," He's super tall! Which would be fitting for the New Zealand team, who are nicknamed ""the tall blacks."" ",Surprised
1160,Haha I guess. That name is pretty crazy. Definitely offensive over here haha. Did you know that the Supreme Court has a basketball court on the top floor?,Surprised
1160," Yeah pretty offensive, but pretty accurate. I did know that! And they call it the ""highest court in the land."" Also an accurate name. haha",Happy
1160,Haha I love that name. Do you know that the creator of the game basketball was a losing coach for his university? He's the only using coach in the whole history of the University actually haha,Surprised
1160,That's sad and ironic haha. Did you know that all Cornell students must pass a swim test before they can graduate?,Curious to dive deeper
1160,Oh wow that's interesting. I know that in our school you had to pass a swimming test as well. But we live in Michigan and are surrounded by lakes so maybe that's why haha,Surprised
1160,Maybe! I feel like that's a basic survival skill that everyone should possess. I knew a few people when I graduated who couldn't swim and I didn't understand how or why.,Surprised
1160," Wow are you serious? I don't know why it's so hard for people to swim haha, did you hear about the way to swim where you bind your hands and legs, you end up swimming like a dolphin and that's apparently a thing that people do haha",Surprised
1160," I can swim well, but if I did that, I'd probably drown. I used to swim on a swim team and having a good swimsuit was important. There's a swimsuit that was banned by the Olympics because 94% of all races in 2008 were won by people who wore it.",Surprised
1160,Haha that's wild! I wonder if that would help to make me really good at swimming haha. Very crazy that the United States has as many gold medals in swimming as the rest of the world combined. We are really dominant at swimming I guess haha,Surprised
1160,Definitely thank swimmers like Phelps for that! He had a big hand in getting a bunch of gold metals when he used to compete in the Olympics.,Happy
1160,Oh yeah you're right. He's definitely awesome! Did you know that the Native Americans used a very strange front crawl swimming stroke when they beat the British at the olympics one year,Surprised
1161," Hi, how are you?",Happy
1161," Hello!  I'm doing great, how are you doing?",Curious to dive deeper
1161,I'm good.  Thanks for asking.  Do you know how to swim?,Curious to dive deeper
1161,I do know how to swim.  Do you know much about the sport and do you swim?,Curious to dive deeper
1161," Yes, I know how to swim, also.  I learned when I was very small.  I understand there is a type of competitive swimming called dolphin swimming.  Have you ever heard of that?",Curious to dive deeper
1161,I have never heard of dolphin swimming.  I also learned when I was very young how to swim.,Curious to dive deeper
1161," That's cool.  Apparently, the swimmer has their hands and legs bound and swim like a dolphin.  I don't know if I could swim that way?",Curious to dive deeper
1161,I would sink that way and I consider myself a pretty good swimmer.  Did you know that Cornell University students have to pass a basic swimming test in order to graduate?,Neutral
1161," Oh wow!  I did not know that, but I think it's something everyone should know how to do.  It's a good thing!",Surprised
1161,I completely agree!  It is an important life skill to know since most humans live near water or have pools.  Did you know that Native Americans taught the front crawl swimming stroke to the European pioneers?,Neutral
1161," That's interesting, I thought the Indians and pioneers did not get along, so well?",Surprised
1161,I thought the same.  Interesting that pioneers wouldn't know how to swing their arms in a huge variety of ways. Apparently the British only used the breaststroke which is a very slow method of swimming.,Neutral
1161," Well, that makes sense, the Indians probably had to swim all the time and surely more than the British!  I read somewhere that the United States has almost as many gold medals in swimming as the rest of thw orld combined.  That awesome!",Surprised
1161,Wow that is amazing that the US has almost as many gold medals as the rest of the world combined.  It makes sense due to the fact that most other countries near the equator are very small and wouldn't field a large team of athletes.,Curious to dive deeper
1161," That's true, do you like basketball, by chance?",Curious to dive deeper
1161," I love basketball.  Unfortunately, it seems to cause me more injuries and pain these days though!",Neutral
1161," Me too!  But, we still can watch it being played.  Who's your favorite player?",Curious to dive deeper
1161," Well, I actually like older players better.  Everybody likes Steph Curry these days but he wouldn't get a shot off in the 1980's NBA.  My favorite is probably Shaq even though he irked me a lot.",Neutral
1161," That's great, I go back even further. lol Kareem Abdul Jabbar is my favorite all time player.  Nobody dunked like him!",Happy
1161," Very true!  Lew Alcindor, got the dunk banned from the college game!  He is a favorite as well.  He had such a long career.",Curious to dive deeper
1161,Well done.  It's been nice chatting with you this morning.  I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.,Happy
1162," Do you like basketball, swimming or hockey? I like all of them...",Neutral
1162," I love swimming and basketball, but I've never been lucky enough to try hockey. Not enough ice where I live!",Curious to dive deeper
1162,Ha! Where do you live? I swam competitively for a long time so I have an affinity for it.,Surprised
1162," I live in the southwest USA desert. Not much in the way of water here either, but we've got some nice artificial pools. What kind of swimming did you do?",Curious to dive deeper
1162," I swam in High school and college. Swam IM and back... Never where the athlete has their hands and legs bound, and swims like a dolphin.",Neutral
1162," That kind of swimming makes me feel nervous. If something went wrong, the last thing I'd want is bound hands. Did you have to pass a swimming test to graduate like students do at some universities?",Curious to dive deeper
1162," No, I swam on the swim team. We traveled to competitions and swam other colleges. It was fun.",Neutral
1162,Do you still swim for recreation or exercise?,Curious to dive deeper
1162," no, it became too much like work. what about you?",Neutral
1162," I only ever swim for fun, usually in the summer when it's hot. Never been quite good enough to compete. No Summer Olympian here!",Neutral
1162,Nice. Do you like to watch the olympics?,Neutral
1162," I like to watch the events, but I usually skip the talking and backstories in between. The competition is the exciting part for me.",Neutral
1162,Ditto. The united states has almost as many gold medals in swimming as the rest of the world combined.,Happy
1162," That's incredible. I wonder who dominates Olympic hockey. I'd guess Canada, since they did so well in the first winter Olympics and it's their national sport.",Curious to dive deeper
1162,I think so. Also Finland and those countries like Sweden.,Neutral
1162," If you could choose a type of hockey to try, would you pick bandy, field hockey, or ice hockey?",Curious to dive deeper
1162,Ice. I think I would sweat a lot and the ice would help!,Happy
1162," I think ice would be the most fun, but it would also be hard to learn to skate AND play the sport at the same time!",Happy
1162,Agreed. I have skated a lot and could never play hockey.,Happy
1162,I've only roller skated and discovered I'm super clumsy that way. Ice skating takes a whole different kind of balance. I do better when the ice is melted - can't fall down if I'm swimming in it!,Happy
1162,HA! That's a good attitude. An average professional hockey player will lose up to 8 pounds in one game.,Neutral
1162,That sounds like incredibly hard work!,Surprised
1162," Yeah, i could not do it.",Neutral
1162,Good thing you decided on swimming in school then!,Happy
1163," Good morning! How are you? I am a sports fan, what about you?",Happy
1163,Yeah I especially like basketball. Whats your favorite?,Curious to dive deeper
1163," I like all sports to watch. To participate it would be swimming, but just for fun. No way I could compete in a dolphin like swimming style with my arms and legs bound.",Happy
1163,No I dont think I could either. Did you hear about kareem abdul jabbars dunking?,Happy
1163," No, I did not. Was there something special?",Curious to dive deeper
1163,He was just so dominant with it that they banned the dunk for  over a decade.,Happy
1163," Oh that is a long time for a ban. So, back to swimming, there are more gold medals awarded to the US than almost the whole world combined.",Surprised
1163,Thats awesome. Go U.S.A. Did you know that all cornell university students have to pass a swimming test before they can graduate?,Happy
1163,That is insane! Graduation should be based on academics!,Surprised
1163,Well it doesnt hurt to be able to swim. Im sure if there is some reason likemedically you cant swim then they will let you slide.,Happy
1163,I would think so. There is a ban on a swimsuit that is so good 94% of the swimming races in the 2008 Olympics were won wearing it.,Surprised
1163,Maybe it was just the trend that year. I dont see how a swim suit couldmmake you faster. MAybe more aerodynamic but come on.,Surprised
1163,It is weird. Almost as weird as humans being able to just weeks after birth swim as a survival response.,Surprised
1163,That is crazy. We have a strong will to survive I guess. Did you know that native americans introduced the front crawl swimming stroke to the west.,Neutral
1163," No, I did not. I wonder how they learned it?",Curious to dive deeper
1163,I would say from swimming a lot and figuring out the fastest way to swim. Lol. They beat the british with that stroke though. The british only used the breast stroke.,Happy
1163," Good for them. I think they were smart beyond their years. Swimming is a top recreational sport, so it seems its popularity has been around a long time.",Happy
1163,Yep. Anywhere there is water people swim. With our competitive nature we are bound to turn it into sport.,Happy
1163,I would have to agree with you on that one. Swimming lessons are even part of education lessons in some countries.,Happy
1163,My school actually had a swimming pool in middle school. I think it is an important thing for people to learn.,Happy
1163,I agree. I think it is better safe than sorry. That's for sure.,Happy
1163,It sure is. Well I better get some stuff done around here. Have a nice day.,Happy
1163,You as well. Thanks for chatting.,Happy
1164,Do you like watching basketball?,Curious to dive deeper
1164,I do watch basketball on occasion. Which is your favorite team?,Happy
1164," I like the bulls, not doing too hot these recent years lol. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1164,I'm a fan of the Celtics and I'm not that impressed as we were blown out by Clippers yesterday.,Surprised
1164,yea Clippers scored a lot of points last night! Did you hear who the most losingest coach is in college history?,Curious to dive deeper
1164,Yes. I read this somewhere very recently and it is James Naismith if I'm not mistaking.,Curious to dive deeper
1164," right, he is the one that invented basketball! You think he would have rigged it in his favor!",Curious to dive deeper
1164,Ha Ha!!! Do you happen to know at which college he was a coach at?,Curious to dive deeper
1164," It was Kansas if I heard right, a really good program now ",Curious to dive deeper
1164,A very good program at that university indeed.,Happy
1164," for sure! Speaking of college, have you heard of kareem abdul-jabbar?",Curious to dive deeper
1164," I love Kareen Abdul-Jabbar what a fantastic basketball player!!! What did you hear about him, I'm very curious?",Curious to dive deeper
1164,He got the dunk banned in college for like 10 years! He was amazing at it!,Curious to dive deeper
1164,He was amazing at this. I agree but I didn't know that the dunk got banned for that long. Do the women also have a league here in America?,Surprised
1164,Are you talking about the WNBA?,Curious to dive deeper
1164,Oh! That's what it was called. I didn't remember the name of league. Yes I was talking about the WNBA.,Curious to dive deeper
1164,Did you know the supreme court even as a court  in the building? Justice Ginsburg can slam dunk there since she isn't in the WNBA,Curious to dive deeper
1164,Ha Ha!!! That is very funny. I also read somewhere that the New Zealand basketball team has a nickname. Do you happen to know what they are called?,Happy
1164," I don't know, hopefully something good lol",Curious to dive deeper
1164," Unfortunately, no. They are called the tall blacks. I just don't know why. ",Surprised
1164," yikes, I don't think that name would go over so well in the USA lol. It was so nice chatting with you, enjoy your day!",Curious to dive deeper
1165," Hi, how are you?",Happy
1165," Good. Looking forward to the Superbowl. I enjoy the game, but I'm a bit envious over the idea that the players earn so much money to play a game. If fact, in most states, the highest paid state employee is a football or bbal coach",Happy
1165,Who are you rooting for in the super bowl?,Curious to dive deeper
1165,The cheerleaders. I would be a hockey fan if there were cheerleaders for that sport. But they would distract the players from the puck.,Happy
1165,I hope they win. I think cheerleaders would slip too much on the ice...,Happy
1165," That would be enjoyable to watch. I grew up near the border of canada, and hockey is big there. You know, in the 1st olympic winter games, the canadian hockey team scored 132 goals while only allowing 3? Amazing!",Happy
1165,Now that's a good GAA!,Surprised
1165,Hockey is the national sport of canada. Although so is lacrosse. How did they get two?,Happy
1165," They're overachievers... I know why basketball games are so cold now, they keep the ice under the courts!",Surprised
1165," I wonder if the basketball court on top of the supreme court has ice under the floors. They call it the highest court in the land. If the ice melted, they would have a real problem",Happy
1165," yeah, the notorious RBG would slip and break a hip! ",Happy
1165," She is single-handedly responsible for maintaining the Zamboni. I wonder if the New Zealand basketball team, the Tall Blacks, have ever played on the highest court.",Happy
1165,She might try to take out a few conservative justices so they should watch out!,Happy
1165," Yeah, but her moves on the court might get banned, like the dunk was banned from the college game because of Kareem Abdul Jabar.",Happy
1165," If she got her own shoe, would they be banned like Jordan's were?",Happy
1165," Sure! After all, if the inventor of basketball had a losing record as coach for kansas, then anything is possible!",Happy
1165,Do you like college basketball?,Curious to dive deeper
1165,Sure. I even like college swimming.I especially like the race where the hands and feet are bound as they flop around like a dolphin  in the water.,Happy
1165,I do not remember that stroke. I will have to look at it...,Curious to dive deeper
1165,Its called the Flipper crawl I think... LOL  The native Americans introduced the front crawl to the west. But their hands and feet were not bound.,Happy
1165,Nice chatting with you!,Happy
1166," Hello, do you watch basketball?",Curious to dive deeper
1166," Hi, I don't watch basketball",Happy
1166,Oh I see. Then I am guessing you might not be aware who James Naismith is?,Curious to dive deeper
1166,I am aware of who James Naismith is. James Naismith was the inventor of basketball.,Neutral
1166,Oh cool. And do you know why the dunk shot was banned for a while?,Curious to dive deeper
1166," I don't really know the detailed reason why the dunk shot was banned, I know that Kareem abdul-jabbar was the cause of it. Basketball is not really in my interest, I do like hockey more. ",Neutral
1166," Oh cool, did you know hockey players can lose up to 8 pound in a single game?",Curious to dive deeper
1166," I think that is very surprising, but yes I did in fact know that. Hockey is a big sport in Canada, which makes sense why they scored 132 goals in 1924.",Neutral
1166," That is huge, and it is also one of the national sports there",Curious to dive deeper
1166," It is surprising how Canada only has two national sports, lacrosse and ice hockey. Other countries usually have more. ",Neutral
1166,I guess they must like those two the best. Once a hockey player was traded for $1 and won 4 Stanleys later,Curious to dive deeper
1166,That is sad for the team who traded. Hockey in most of the world is referred to as field hockey,Neutral
1166,Yeah it is sad for them but good for him for showing them how much he was worth it,Curious to dive deeper
1166,Do you enjoy swimming?,Neutral
1166," I actually do , a lot. Have you heard of dolphin swimming?",Curious to dive deeper
1166," I have, it is competitive swimming. It is very shocking to hear that Cornell makes student pass a basic swimming test in order to graduate.",Surprised
1166,Yeah that is quite something. Do you know who introduced crawl swimming?,Curious to dive deeper
1166," Yes, the Native Americans did when they beat the British. Do you know what happened during the 2008 Olympics?",Neutral
1166,Oh about that swimming suit that is so good that it is banned,Curious to dive deeper
1166," I wonder what it was made out of. Most of the gold medals were won by United States compared to the other countries, that is quite shocking too",Neutral
1166,Yeah but then again with guys like Phelphs that is no surprise. Nice chatting with you,Happy
1167,Do you listen to country music?,Curious to dive deeper
1167,I do! do you like Kacey Musgraves?,Neutral
1167," I don't really listen to much Country music, but I read that Kacey dropped acid while listening to a Tame Impala record.",Surprised
1167,Yeah i have heard she's the greatest country-singer-for-people-who-don't-listen-to-country-music,Neutral
1167," That would be a good title to have, I suppose! It is just shocking that her music may have been inspired by hallucinogens!",Surprised
1167," Yeah For reality-obsessed country music fans, that's a serious piece of bubble gum to chew on.",Neutral
1167,I guess having her music inspired by hallucinogens has helped out. She is making the big money!,Neutral
1167,yes she is! But Musgraves knows that the real meaning of a song lies in how the voice illuminates the words.,Neutral
1167,Also in how the song makes you feel too!,Neutral
1167," Do you like prog rock? i have heard Thom yorke was credited with playing the ""laptop"" on some radiohead albums.",Neutral
1167,I guess I am not familiar with prog rock? What is that?,Curious to dive deeper
1167,Progressive rock? like Pearl Jam? I read online that Aerosmith made more money from Guitar Hero than any album.,Surprised
1167," Oh, Yes! I have never heard it called that! That is interesting that Aerosmith makes more money from guitar hero! That is a nice easy way to bring in more money!",Surprised
1167," Yeah I don't buy much music anymore. But Walmart only sells clean versions of albums, so don't go there for music.",Neutral
1167,I usually download albums through amazon music! I love linkin park.,Happy
1167,they are a good band. Country music was originally inspired and derived from celtic music most people are not aware of that,Neutral
1167,I did not know that! I did know that there are only 2 African Americans in the Country music hall of fame!,Neutral
1167,hmm that seems odd to me.  i do know The fender stratocaster was intended for country music but it sounds good in any band,Neutral
1167," I think it is odd, too! I would think there would be more! Maybe Darius Rucker will make it into the hall of fame! That is neat the stratocaster is so versatile. ",Surprised
1167," one weird fact is In 1996 an album called ""nfl country"" was released where nfl players would sing along with current country music stars. as you can imagine it was bad",Neutral
1167,I bet that would be funny to hear though! Kind of like the bad lip readings!,Neutral
1167," yeah i thought it was interesting. but Connie b. gay is credited with coining the term ""country music"".",Neutral
1167,It used to be called hillbilly music! Thank goodness for change.,Surprised
1167,Yeah they like to sing about their horses in country music a lot. and horses funny enough are ticklish,Neutral
1168," Hi. Do you enjoy watching or playing sports? I'm not very athletic, but I love to watch.",Curious to dive deeper
1168," Yes, basketball is one of the sports I really like.",Neutral
1168,Do you play? I understand that college coaches of basketball and football are the highest paid in the state.,Surprised
1168," I used to play college high school basketball, but I never played football.",Curious to dive deeper
1168,Were you a good player? Is their an overtime period required if their is a tie at the end of the game?,Curious to dive deeper
1168," I was pretty good, but not the best, yes if there is a tie team do go overtime.",Curious to dive deeper
1168," Personally, I like swimming. I'm not very good, but I can keep myself above water. I love watching that portion of the Olympics. Do you think the U.S. has more gold medals in swimming that other countries?",Curious to dive deeper
1168," Yes, I would say so, especially when Michael Phelps won 23 Olympic gold medal.",Curious to dive deeper
1168," Oh, that's right, I forgot about him. I had to take swimming in college, did you? It wasn't mandatory in my school, but a student needed a certain number of credits in athletics generally.",Neutral
1168," No, I learn to swim in my family backward in a small lake. I learn the backstroke first time I try.",Curious to dive deeper
1168,The backstroke is good. Did you ever hear of swimming like a dolphin? It seems difficult since legs and arms are bound. I would definitely feel like I were going to drown. I prefer the side stroke or the breaststroke. Both are allowed in competition.,Fearful
1168," Yes, I can do the dolphin type swim and the breaststroke.",Surprised
1168,Wow. That's impressive. What do you know about hockey?,Curious to dive deeper
1168," I don't know anything about hockey, we just got a hockey team in our town recently. Are you a hockey fan?",Curious to dive deeper
1168," Not really. I know you use a hockey stick. ;) We had to spend some time playing field hockey in school, and I scored a goal. I hear it's a great sport in which to lose weight. Pro's lose weight from the activity in even one game.",Surprised
1168," Yes, the average hockey player lose up to 8 pounds in one game.",Surprised
1168," Wow, really? I guess all athletes are physically sound. Do they really flood basketball courts in order to play ice hockey?",Curious to dive deeper
1168," That what I heard, I think Canada has one of the best team. I wonder how they flood basketball courts?",Curious to dive deeper
1168," Don't know, but I hear that is true. I think Canada played in the first winter Olympics. It is one of their national sports along with lacrosse, which I know nothing about,",Curious to dive deeper
1168," I like watching hockey on TV, but I wonder about all the hitting they take, it's a rough sport.",Curious to dive deeper
1168," Very rough. The teams erupt into fighting a lot, too.",Sad
1168," I don't know which is most roughest, football or hockey.",Curious to dive deeper
1168," True, but the hockey sticks can be used as weapons.",Disgusted
1168," Yes, I agree, we got a new hockey team next door, one day I will go see them live, maybe I can get into hockey.",Curious to dive deeper
1168," Wow, that is quite a goal. Well, if you want to get into it, I hope you can. It was great talking with you. Have a blessed day.",Happy
1169,do you watch the academy awards?,Curious to dive deeper
1169,I watch the last one as some great movies were nominated and you?,Curious to dive deeper
1169,Me too/. Di you know Day Lewis has won it three times?,Curious to dive deeper
1169," Yes and for the same category, best actor, what a guy",Curious to dive deeper
1169,I know right? Blazzing Saddles was also nominated for three awards,Curious to dive deeper
1169,Yeah pretty cool. Does not beat Walt Disney though,Curious to dive deeper
1169," Yeah he has 22 oscars under his name, tough to beat",Curious to dive deeper
1169,Yeah I know. Did you know EMinem has more Oscars than Leo di Caprio?,Curious to dive deeper
1169," Yes and George Lucas and Johnny Depp and a bunch other, amazing",Curious to dive deeper
1169,I know right? Even Oscars themselves were nominated for other awards,Curious to dive deeper
1169,Yes they were nominated for 9 Emmys once,Curious to dive deeper
1169,Haha amazing. Did you ever play with Nintendo?,Curious to dive deeper
1169,Yes I sued to until it was discontinued in 2003 and you?,Curious to dive deeper
1169,Yes I did too. It only had 54 colors,Curious to dive deeper
1169,Yes 54 colors but that was a whole lot of fun to be honest,Curious to dive deeper
1169,Yes true. Do you know who Bill Nye is?,Curious to dive deeper
1169,Yes that is the science guy. Do you know how he became famous?,Curious to dive deeper
1169," Yes, he won a Steve Martin lookalike contest",Curious to dive deeper
1169,So funny. Even Reagan once tried his hand at acting,Curious to dive deeper
1169,Yeah that sis not go very well as he did not land the role of the president.,Curious to dive deeper
1169,Yes good for him went to be a president in real life,Curious to dive deeper
1170,Do you play basketball?,Curious to dive deeper
1170,I did in middle school. I wasn't very tall so I moved on to football in HS.  Did you go out for track and field?,Curious to dive deeper
1170,Actually no. I always wished our school had a swim team though.,Curious to dive deeper
1170,Some of these track kids are amazing. This kid Ethan Fogle did 500 meters in 1:05.31.,Angry
1170,WOW! That is fast. Did you know a hockey player was traded for $1 in 1993?,Curious to dive deeper
1170," Sound like what I would be worth.  Another track kid, Donovan Louis did 55 meters in 6.43 seconds and a long jump of 24-3.25. What an athlete. ",Surprised
1170,Well apparently that player went on to win 4 Stanely Cups.,Curious to dive deeper
1170," That showed 'em.  It's kinda sad that in 39 of 50 states, the highest paid state employee are college football or basketball coaches.  Education seems to be of secondary importance. ",Surprised
1170,I can believe it. Likely at some of the state sponsored universities.,Curious to dive deeper
1170," Yep.  I bet swimming coaches don't get paid much.  I can't believe at Cornell, students have to pass a basic swimming test.  Are they expecting a flood? ",Surprised
1170," Yeah, I bet they don't. That is crazy that they have to pass a swimming test. ",Curious to dive deeper
1170,It's also crazy that an average pro hockey player can lose 8 lbs. in one game.  Crash diet!  Must be all the stuff they wear.,Surprised
1170," Yeah, but that is probably about right. They probably sweat a lot under their shirts. ",Curious to dive deeper
1170," I wonder how much swimmers lose at a match.  That is, if they aren't wearing the ""banned"" swimsuit from the 2008 olympics. ",Angry
1170,Hilarious. I'm not sure what that banned swimsuit is though.,Curious to dive deeper
1170,It was banned because 94% of all swimming races were won using it.,Neutral
1170,Holy moly. Apparently the US has so many gold metals in swimming it comes close to all of the rest of the world combined.,Curious to dive deeper
1170,That's cool.  Can you believe the U.S. Supreme Court has a basketball court on the roof.  I can just see Ruth Bader Ginsburg slam dunking a few.,Surprised
1170," I can believe it, it's the HIGH COURT!",Curious to dive deeper
1170,Hee.  I wonder what Canada's high court has.  They have two national sports: lacrosse and ice hockey.,Curious to dive deeper
1170," Interesting, I wonder which one everyone up there prefers? ",Curious to dive deeper
1171,Have you watched any of the Marvel shows on Netflix?  I really enjoy Daredevil.,Happy
1171," I love them, I heard they got cancelled, too bad because the 3rd season of Daredevil was the best so far.",Curious to dive deeper
1171,I love that they made the show gritty and realistic.  I wish it could of lasted longer.  Wilson Fisk is one scary man,Curious to dive deeper
1171," He is one scary man I agree did you also liked Iron Fist, The Defenders?",Curious to dive deeper
1171," I have not seen defenders yet, but I have heard some of the reviews.  I have seen Jessica Jones, which was a bit dark and disturbing",Curious to dive deeper
1171,It was disturbing well theres also the Punisher that one is great but also a bit graphic and dark,Happy
1171," Yes, Punisher was like Rambo on speed.  It was intense",Surprised
1171," It was intense I agree, do you like Charlie Cox as an actor? the star of Daredevil?",Curious to dive deeper
1171," Honestly, it is the only thing I hae seen him in, but I have liked him in this role quite a bit",Happy
1171,And what about Vincent D'Onofrio? I think he really nailed the role of Wilson Fisk,Curious to dive deeper
1171,He is a great actor.  I cannot imagine anyone else as the Kingpin,Happy
1171," Yeah I agree, he really sells the role of the crime boss and then Wilson Bethel also nailed his role",Curious to dive deeper
1171," Yes, Bullseye is one of my favorite Marvel Comics villians.  Marvel sure makes a lot of great characters.",Curious to dive deeper
1171," Yeah they sure do, do you have a favorite hero?",Curious to dive deeper
1171,I grew up on the X-men.  But Stan Lee created so many others like Fantastic Four and Spider-man that I love as well,Happy
1171,One of my favorites is Iron Man I also like Batman. Its sad that Stan Lee is no longer with us,Curious to dive deeper
1171," Well, he had a good run.  And because of him a lot of people have enjoyed great stories for years",Happy
1171,Yeah he sure left a legacy behind and I bet Sony regrets not buying the rights to all of the Marvel heroes when they had the chance,Curious to dive deeper
1171,I would imagine so.  At least they still have spider-man,Curious to dive deeper
1171,Yeah so not everything is lost I hear that Marvel shares a character with DC comics.,Curious to dive deeper
1171,It is good to see them working together.  Good talking to you.,Happy
1172," Hey there do you ever watch basketball? Apparently a normal goal is worth 2 points and then if you make a point from that 3 point line, that is worth three points",Curious to dive deeper
1172," I don't watch it much now, but I used to go to a lot of high school basketball games because my brother played. Considering how tall he is, I think he was a center",Neutral
1172,Oh that makes sense. I used to play a little bit in middle school myself. I have watched a lot of games go into overtime myself. Those are really entertaining I think,Curious to dive deeper
1172,Definitely! Even the Supreme Court likes to play a game every once in a while since the top floor of their building has a basketball court,Neutral
1172," I know isn't that wild! And it's called the ""highest court in the land"". That's such a funny and goofy name haha",Surprised
1172," Of course it would be punny like that. I wonder if there's a funny story behind why the New Zealand basketball team is also known as the ""tall blacks""",Curious to dive deeper
1172,Yes it's either a funny story or a sad story haha. Another sad story is that the creator of basketball was a losing coach for his university. Apparently the only one to haha how is that possible,Surprised
1172,It's possible that he was coaching a different sport and invented basketball as a way to redeem himself,Neutral
1172,Haha that's a good theory. Do you have a theory on why the dunk was banned from college basketball for over 10 years? From what I heard it was because Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was too good at it haha,Happy
1172," Probably. Sometimes things are banned for their overuse or for safety reasons, but then the rules change later",Neutral
1172," On a separate note, do you ever watch hockey? Or do you have a favorite team? I know that I like the Red Wings",Curious to dive deeper
1172," I don't watch it, but I have a friend who really enjoys it. There was a player who won four Stanley Cups who was traded for $1 at one point. I guess he showed them",Neutral
1172,Wow that is pretty crazy haha. I bet the team that traded him is kicking themselves haha. Why do you think Canada's national sports are lacrosse and ice hockey?,Curious to dive deeper
1172," I'm not sure about lacrosse, but it's cold enough up there most of the year for ice hockey to be popular. ",Neutral
1172,Yes that must be what it is. It's just so cold those are the only games that they can play year-round haha. Did you know that most hockey rinks are actually basketball courts as well? They can just change the floor out,Surprised
1172,I have seem stadiums set up like that. Maybe I should try ice hockey since professional players can lost 8 pounds in one game,Curious to dive deeper
1172,I should do that too! I need to lose some weight haha. Canada is so dominant at hockey though. In the first Winter Olympic Games they scored 132 goals,Surprised
1172,I hope they got the gold medal with that many goals!,Surprised
1172,I think they won haha! Apparently they only let in like three goals for the entire winter Olympics,Happy
1172,That's impressive. I wonder if they ever venture into field hockey like other countries do,Curious to dive deeper
1172," I wonder that too. Apparently only like five countries call that hockey, and the rest of them call it field hockey like you mentioned. just the name field hockey sounds weird to me haha",Surprised
1173,Do you like basketball?,Curious to dive deeper
1173,I like basketball. I haven't actively played since I was 12 years old. I love watching basketball and I am looking forward to the Golden State Warriors game tonight. Do you like basketball?,Neutral
1173," I don't really watch it but I should! I enjoy it when I go to live games. Golden State Warriors is my favorite too, well, since I am from the Bay Area. It's funny that the inventor of basketball is the only losing coach in University of Kansas's history.",Curious to dive deeper
1173,Do you have a certain team that you follow? Which live game did you go to? That sounds silly. He is the inventor!,Neutral
1173," I know right? Why not change the rules to suit you. Haha, just kidding. I went to a Suns game, in Phoenix. I don't really follow sports though.",Curious to dive deeper
1173," If he keeps on losing, he needs to step it up and have a conference about the rules. The Suns against the Warriors? It is okay. I follow sports when my family and friends are watching them.",Neutral
1173,It was just a Suns game that I went to. Versus...the team from Oklahoma. What is that team called? I've only been to one so far. For most college basketball coaches the job is lucrative. In 39 out of 50 states they are the highest paid state employee.,Curious to dive deeper
1173," I am guessing that the Oklahoma Thunders won that game though, sorry. I have been to three college games, but it was mostly from UC Berkeley. I bet it is in either basketball or football right?",Neutral
1173,I forget who won. It was a long time ago. Haha. I think dunking is cool when you see it in person. Apparently Kareem Abdul Jabbar got it banned from college basketball for over a decade.,Curious to dive deeper
1173,The last game I went to the Oklahoma Thunders game was when they went to the Warriors stadium. The Warriors lost. What is the reason why he was banned?,Curious to dive deeper
1173,He used it as a dominant move.,Curious to dive deeper
1173,What is a dominant move?,Curious to dive deeper
1173," I am not sure. I just read that it said his ""dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned."" I would love to go to the supreme court building and shoot a game of horse there! They have a basketball court on the top floor called ""the highest court in the land.""",Surprised
1173," I heard. Maybe on their spare time, the judges would like to have some leisure time to shoot some hoops.",Neutral
1173," I am fantasizing about judges in robes playing basketball. Yeah, right, but it's a funny picture!",Surprised
1173," You do not know, they probably have gyms in there as well. It would be like every other company building like Google.",Curious to dive deeper
1173,Do you like Hockey? Canada actually has another national sport besides hockey. It is lacrosse.,Curious to dive deeper
1173,The only hockey I can think of is the Sharks. Lacrosse is slowly spreading in the states.,Neutral
1173,Interesting. I wonder if it will ever be one of our national sports.,Curious to dive deeper
1173,You will never know. Expect the unexpected.,Neutral
1173," Yeah, there are probably tons of things that will evolve in the sports arena. The British didn't even know how to front crawl before it was introduced by the Native Americans.",Surprised
1174,Hello - did you know Daniel Day Lewis is the only actor to win best actor at the Oscars 3 different times?,Surprised
1174," Hi there, no I didn't know that, I wonder what 3 films he won for?",Curious to dive deeper
1174," It doesn't say, but that's really good. I saw that Blazing Saddles was also nominated for 3 Oscars. ",Surprised
1174," That movie was awesome, and yeah that is very impressive, I think he is a good actor. ",Curious to dive deeper
1174,It was a very good movie. Walt Disney holds the record for the most Oscars won by a man with 22 won. Pretty amazing!,Surprised
1174," Holy cow, that is a crazy amount of oscars to win!  Did you know George Lucas' wife won an oscar, but George hasn't?",Curious to dive deeper
1174,LOL - that's crazy! Talk about animosity.,Surprised
1174,Yeah and I think they are still together somehow lol.  Did you know the oscars themselves have been nominated for emmy awards?,Curious to dive deeper
1174,Haha that's funny. I didn't even know that was possible.,Surprised
1174," I don't like that to be honest, an awards show, getting an award at another award show, lol ",Curious to dive deeper
1174," Very dumb. Another crazy stat is that Eminem has more Oscars than Dicaprio, Johnny Depp, Will Smith, George Lucas, and Bill Murray combined!",Surprised
1174," Yeah that is such an impressive list, I don't know how Dicaprio hasn't won and Murray as well.  I guess all of them really. ",Curious to dive deeper
1174,Did you know Nintendo can be displayed in only 54 colors?,Surprised
1174," No I didn't know that, did you have an original Nintendo years ago?",Curious to dive deeper
1174," I did lol. I'm 32 so that was my first gaming system. Apparently, it was discontinued in Japan back in 2003. ",Happy
1174," I didn't know that and yeah my best friend had it so basically I did too growing up, I remember in the 1st grade asking what i loved most and i think i said Nintendo. ",Curious to dive deeper
1174,haha that's funny. Did you know Ronald Reagan was once rejected from a movie role because the executive didn't think he fit the presidential look...LOL?,Happy
1174," That is too funny, I wonder if that person still had a job after he became president lol. ",Curious to dive deeper
1174,haha good thought!,Surprised
1174,I always think of the line from Back to the Future when I hear the name Ronald Reagan and being an actor.,Curious to dive deeper
1174,Yep - me too. Good talking to you!,Happy
1175," Hey, do you like to play basketball?",Neutral
1175," I do! Did you know the US Supreme Court building has a basketball court on the top floor known as ""the highest court in the land""? LOL.",Neutral
1175," Haha. Very punny. Did you know that the New Zealand basketball team are called the ""tall blacks""?",Surprised
1175,That seems pretty offensive.,Neutral
1175," I agree, and slightly racist may I add. Do you swim?",Curious to dive deeper
1175," I meant it was offensive because it was racist. I do like to swim, not competitively. I had a friend compete in the Olympics; needless to say, they're pretty good considering the US swim team has almost as many gold medals as the rest of world combined.",Neutral
1175,Wow! Good for him! I wish I could be that good at anything! There are banned swimsuits because they were too effective.,Surprised
1175," Haha, I wish I could get one of those swimsuits! Though even the best suit couldn't prepare me for that weird type of competition where you have your hands and legs bound and you have to swim like a dolphin.",Neutral
1175," That is very weird, must be very tiring. The swimsuits were so good that 94% of the winners of races were wearing those swimsuits.",Curious to dive deeper
1175,That's crazy. I wonder how they are made.,Neutral
1175,I wonder too. Native Americans were the ones who introduced Europeans to Front crawl,Surprised
1175," Oh right, because the Brits only ever used the breaststroke.",Neutral
1175," Yep, and they must have been very shocked when they were beat by Native Americans. I sure hope they learned their lesson from that.",Disgusted
1175," I imagine everyone learned the importance of swimming from that. It's so important at Cornell, every student must pass a basic swimming test in order to graduate.",Neutral
1175,I think that that is an excellent idea. Do you play hockey?,Neutral
1175," I don't, but I enjoy watching it. I assume we're talking about ice hockey, as there are many types in addition to ice hockey, such as field hockey and bandy.",Neutral
1175,Indeed. Canada is the only country in the world with two national sports: Hockey and lacrosse.,Happy
1175," Yeah, Canada is awesome at hockey. In the first Olympics, they scored 132 goals. Only let in 3. That's impressive!",Neutral
1175," Agreed. Furthermore, in 1993, a hockey player was traded for $1 and that player went on to win 4 stanley cups!",Surprised
1175,Geez. Can you believe the average hockey player will lose over 5 pounds in a game?,Neutral
1175," I believe it was 8 pounds. Anyways, that is still insane. I can barely even lose 5 pounds on a diet!",Happy
1175," Yes, I believe the lose up to 8 pounds, which is likely over 5 pounds. Definitely a lot of play time to warrant that weight loss.",Neutral
1175,The Ice Hockey ring remains under a basketball court when switching between sports. Amazing right>,Neutral
1175,I have actually seen them do it many times. It's pretty cool!,Neutral
1176," Ever heard of Kacey Musgrave?  She's been described as a ""country music singer for people who don't listen to country music"".",Curious to dive deeper
1176," I have heard of her, but I am not really a country music fan. I'm of the group that considers it bad music.",Disgusted
1176," Oh, don't tell some of my relatives that.  They'd skin ya alive! ",Curious to dive deeper
1176," I should give it a listen. I assume the album is available on CD, vinyl, and tape.",Happy
1176," Probably not tape... but who knows?  What type of music you listen to, then?  I like various kinds myself.  Grow up with 80s rock, but I also like 90s techno-industrial.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1176,Same! The 80s are hard to beat. Lynkin Park's hybrid theory album was great. No surprise it is the best selling of the 21st century.,Happy
1176," Oh yeah, that was a good album!  I'm told they did like 324 tours the year it was released!  Pity what happened with Chester Bennington though.... :(",Sad
1176,So sad. Mental health issues are too often ignored these days.,Sad
1176," Yeah, they are.  Speaking of big albums, did you know Dark Side of Moon was one of the best selling albums of 2014?  ",Surprised
1176,I love pink floyd. They have stood the test of time. As has NWA. Straight outta compton is a classic and the first to reach platinum status without a tour.,Happy
1176," Not just a tour, but w/o any support of airplay.  Can't imagine going platinum even though you have so little support from the ""traditional"" system.  They really struck a chord with people I think.",Surprised
1176,Horses in their videos would gain traction. Horses are odd toed animals that have been domesticated since 4000 BC.,Neutral
1176," Yeah, that's true.  Speaking of horse, they say Dalmatians are used with firefighters because in the old days they would help calm and protect the horses.  ",Surprised
1176,I love dalmatians. They are pretty dogs. I wonder if they would calm the icelandic horses with their fifth speedwalking speed capabilities.,Curious to dive deeper
1176," I don't know, maybe.  Ironically, Clint Eastwood has developed a mid-life allergy to horses.  Must have made it hard to do all those cowboy roles he's known for.",Curious to dive deeper
1176," I wonder is he is allergic to the przewalski horse, the only remaining wild horse species.",Curious to dive deeper
1176," What I find neat is Lipizzaner horses.  They are born black or brown but turn completely white in about six years.  Neat, huh?",Surprised
1176,I have never seen one of those. I will google it later. That horse would be quite a show for the students if the kids that rode horses to school on no vehicles day rode a white horse!,Surprised
1176," Yeah, the would be pretty amazing!  I've heard those student got suspended though... even though they technically didn't break the rule.. LOL.",Curious to dive deeper
1176,What a wild day that must have been! Nice meeting you! Bye!,Surprised
1176,nice meeting you too! have a good one!,Happy
1177,Swimming is a very interesting sport. It's awesome that Sean Conway Jr. got so many all-American times in 2018. What about you?,Surprised
1177," Swimming is a great sport. Not only do you get great exercise, but because you are in water, the stress on your body is lowered",Neutral
1177,It's so interesting that babies can swim within weeks of birth. Have you ever heard about that before?,Surprised
1177,I haven't but hopefully they are wearing some floats,Neutral
1177,It's supposed to be a survival response. They can even hold their breath underwater at that age.,Curious to dive deeper
1177,Oh I see. Did you know it was native americans who introduced the crawling swimming stroke?,Neutral
1177," Yes, they even beat the British with it, because the British only ever used the breaststroke! That's so cool.",Happy
1177,Do you think that the swimsuit used in the olympics should be standardized?,Neutral
1177," I don't think so, since only 94% of all the swimmers used it in 2008. Maybe some countries weren't able to afford it for their swimmers.",Neutral
1177," I mean it isn't that 94% of all swimmers used it. It was that of those who won, the vast majority used that swimsuit so it may be considered an unfair advantage",Neutral
1177," Yes, that's what I was thinking too. I wonder if it's only banned in the Olympics or in high school and college too.",Curious to dive deeper
1177,Probably both if it is affordable. Is there any other sports you enjoy?,Neutral
1177," Yes, I really enjoy ice hockey. It's the national sport of Canada, along with lacrosse.",Happy
1177,I am always amazed that people are able to play so well on ice. I can barely stand up,Neutral
1177,Same with me. It's amazing there are so many great hockey players. They can lose up to 8 pounds in one game!,Surprised
1177,I mean the calorie expenditure must be immense. Did you know a player traded for 1 dollar in 1993 went on to win 4 stanely cups?,Neutral
1177,That's crazy! The team that let him go must have regretted it.,Surprised
1177,Kind of like the tom brady of hockey,Neutral
1177," Yeah. Did you know that in the first winter olympics Canada's ice hockey team scored 132 goals, and only let 3 goals in?",Surprised
1177,No wonder hockey is their national sport.,Neutral
1177," Yeah, they are really into hockey. I guess that's why they're one of the few countries who refer to ice hockey with the word ""hockey"".",Surprised
1177," Indeed. In any case, thank for taking the time to chat. Hope you have a nice day.",Neutral
1178,Are you a fan of sports?,Curious to dive deeper
1178,I am but i don't get to watch much anymore. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
1178," I watch here and there, I am really into basketball. Do you have a favorite team?",Curious to dive deeper
1178,I do not unfortunately. Who are you rooting for?,Curious to dive deeper
1178," I am a bulls fan, but I should say someone else because they haven't done good in years lol ",Curious to dive deeper
1178," I wouldn't even know, lol! I was a swimmer though. We have almost as many gold medals in swimming then the rest of the world has combined. ",Curious to dive deeper
1178," wow, I believe that, we kick butt in the olympics. I love swimming, but never competitively. There is a competitive one i would have been good at where you swim like a dolphin only lol",Curious to dive deeper
1178,Really that would be similar to the breaststroke i'm guessing. Did you hear about the swim suit that got banned?,Curious to dive deeper
1178," I have not heard of it, which one was it?",Curious to dive deeper
1178,They wont say only that 94% of all swimming races in 2008 were won wearing it. That's deep i wonder now what it was made of.,Curious to dive deeper
1178," wow, I do too and if it is banned everywhere! That is a good stat",Curious to dive deeper
1178," Yeah that is very strange, i'm intrigued now. Do you ever watch Hockey?",Curious to dive deeper
1178," I don't watch much, but I have been to a few games in my life, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1178,I love watching the play-off games and i have not been but i want to go soon.,Curious to dive deeper
1178," The fights are crazy in person lol, that was my favorite part! The average hockey player loses 8 pounds per game, that is a lot!",Curious to dive deeper
1178,Right too funny!,Curious to dive deeper
1178," In the first winter olympic games, canada scored 132 goals during them, that would be crazy awesome to watch ",Curious to dive deeper
1178,Yeah that would have been awesome. Did you hear about the hockey player that was traded for a dollar?,Curious to dive deeper
1178,That would be so discouraging to ever play the game again lol. I wonder if he quit after,Curious to dive deeper
1178," No surprisingly enough he went on to win 4 Stanley cups, it happened in 1993. I would like to know who he was. ",Curious to dive deeper
1178," Wow, that was awesome, good for him! It was so great chatting with you, have a great weekend!",Curious to dive deeper
1179,Do you watch Daredevil?,Curious to dive deeper
1179," I have seen it on Netflix, but haven't watched it, have you?",Curious to dive deeper
1179," No, I haven't. I'm not really into superhero series. Though I thought Jessica Jones was okay.",Happy
1179," I'm not either, I watched a few of the movies only because my husband wanted to. I see that Marvel comics created a superhero for a little 4 year old boy, the superhero ""Blue Ear"", because of the boy being uncomfortable to wear hearing aids, that was nice.",Surprised
1179,That is nice. Daredevil is on its third season so a lot of people must like it.,Curious to dive deeper
1179," Yep, also Netflix accounts for 33% of internet bandwidth between the hours of 9pm to midnight in North America.",Surprised
1179,I am guilty for contributing to that. That is how I wind down. Netflix and Youtube together are half ofpeak internet traffic in North America.,Surprised
1179," I'm am a watcher as well, every evening.  Wow, Blockbuster declined the purchase of Netflix for 50 million years ago, now Netflix is worth 2 billion, bet they regret that one!",Surprised
1179,I'll bet. Netflix still spends more money on postage than bandwidth though. I forgot that they still offer DVD rentals.,Surprised
1179,I used to participate in the DVD rentals but it's just easier to rent or buy from Vudu or Amazon prime or something.,Neutral
1179," Yeah, I usually run out of content to watch for a few days but it gives me a little break. Then new content is available for me to stream. So I don't usually have use for the DVDs.",Happy
1179," I agree, I think I've watched all the Thrillers on Netflix and Prime, ha. There was actually a comic book series that came out about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheros, funny.",Surprised
1179,Have you heard of a superhero called normalman? He was the only person who didn't have powers on a planet full of superheroes.,Surprised
1179," No, I haven't.  I will have to look him up, never heard of him. Talk about being the odd one out, bet he feel really insecure on that planet!",Surprised
1179," Yeah, it's an interesting concept. Apparently Daredevil's season three is really good. I might have to check it out.",Curious to dive deeper
1179," Oh my goodness, there's actually over 300 registered superheroes in the United States!",Surprised
1179,That's quite a bit. I wonder how many are Marvel and DC.,Curious to dive deeper
1179," Good question, will have to look that one up also!  Garfield had a book series spinoff named Pet Force, it featured him and his gang as Superheroes, funny!",Surprised
1179,I'd like to check that out. Garfield is hilarious.,Happy
1179," I still enjoy watching Garfield and Scooby Doo.  I remember, staying up late at night with a flashlight, reading Superman and Batman comic books, when they were like, ten or fifteen cents!",Surprised
1179," Wow, that's amazing. What great memories.",Happy
1180,Hi. How are you ? Do you like comic books ? i very much do and my favorite ones are Marvel Comics,Curious to dive deeper
1180," I am well, thanks! I have never really read comic books before but I learned recently that Marvel has been around since 1939 under the name Atlas Comics. I am more of a Netflix person myself haha.",Curious to dive deeper
1180," Yes, Marvel has been around for a long time, i was surprised to find out that Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel in 2009. Oh, and i also enjoy Netflix very much",Curious to dive deeper
1180," It's good to know that a third of the bandwidth in North America is during the 9 pm to 12 am time slot. I wonder if that impacts the user quality, I am not very knowledgeable in that area.",Surprised
1180," So does that means most people are up later at night watching Netflix,? I think it is really cool how netflix was created because of a late vhs fee ...lol",Happy
1180," Yeah, I think so. I would wonder if I watched at 2 am if movies would glitch less. I seem to have that issue sometimes but it could be my internet connection. That is cool and I can totally relate. I am not exactly good at remember to return things right away and always end up incurring the dreaded late fee haha.",Curious to dive deeper
1180," Back to the topic of comics, it seems like Netflix has many shows about superheroes or stories based off of popular superheroes which makes it even more popular in my opinion. Considering there are over 300 registered superheros in the USA alone, that is alot to entertain us with. ",Curious to dive deeper
1180,I find myself watching documentaries a lot but am looking for new movies to watch! I will have to check out some of the Stan Lee superhero movies like Batman or Superman. Which would you recommend? Normalman sounds kind of funny too.,Curious to dive deeper
1180,I like the disney descendants which is more of a teen or family movie but as an adult i still enjoyed it. It is about the kids of the villians.  What about the garfield spinoff named per force ? Maybe you might like that too. There is so much to choose from. I have not seen Normalman but it sounds very interesting,Neutral
1180," That sounds good, and family-friendly as well. I loved Garfield!! I wonder if Netflix has the old episodes, reminds me of my childhood lol. I also think female superheroes are awesome, so maybe I'll have check out some of those ones too.",Curious to dive deeper
1180," To answer your earlier question, i like Superman more than Batman. They are both good movies but Superman reminds me of my childhood and i love Christopher Reeves as Superman. Yes female hero are often called super heroine...i like wonder woman. That movie is on netflix",Curious to dive deeper
1180,Is there a newer Wonder Woman? Thanks for the info! I will check out Superman maybe later today since I am having a lazy day. I am surprised but not surprised at the same time that netflix and youtube make up HALF of North America's internet traffic. People love watching stuff I guess!,Curious to dive deeper
1180," Yes i think people like the ability to stream movies and videos anytime anywhere even on a cell phone, the technology has become so advanced that netflix and youtube are the modern day way to watch tv. i was surprised by how big Netflix is in other countries though I mean Wow , Their company  has offices in the Netherlands, Brazil, India, Japan, and South Korea. ",Curious to dive deeper
1180," Wow! That's pretty impressive, I wonder if that statistic applies across the world. Prob not though haha I can see why Netflix started offering everything online since they spend 20x more on postage than bandwidth!",Curious to dive deeper
1180," i know, its a huge company. With 137 million total subscribers worldwide. I know other companies are starting to pop up now too such as Hulu..sling etc. but netflix is the best i think so far. so much better than renting videos. ",Happy
1180," Yeah, I have an Amazon Prime account so I watch on there too. It's crazy to think how much the world has changed in just the past ten years. I think that's when i got my first smartphone. 2009!",Curious to dive deeper
1180,Is amazon Prime similar to netflix ? i thought Amazon Prime was just for shopping?,Curious to dive deeper
1180," Yes! Well, there are a lot of different benefits that you get with the Prime account",Curious to dive deeper
1180," Well I will certainly check out Amazon Prime, thanks for the tip. It has been a really nice and informative chat with you today. :)",Neutral
1180," I didn't mean to send that message so quickly, got a little click happy. I also subscribe to amazon Music but that's an extra fee every month unfortunately. Same to you, it's been nice talking with you. Have a nice rest of the day!",Happy
1180,Thank you. Have a good Day. Enjoy your superman movies,Happy
1181,Are You a basketball fan ?,Neutral
1181," No, not particularly though I have attended professional games and recall when Kareem's dunk shot was banned from college basketball.  I'm more into swimming.",Curious to dive deeper
1181,why was it banned ?,Curious to dive deeper
1181," I believe it was because he was the only one, or one of a few, who was tall enough to do it!  LOL.  Kinda like the extra fast swim suit that is banned from competition.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1181,is that even possible ? The swimsuit ? ;),Curious to dive deeper
1181,Yes.  I believe it was Michael Phelps who used it.  It's super slick and I think might have some webbing in the hands and feet.  It's a FULL BODY suit. 94% of the wearers won at the 2008 Olympics!,Curious to dive deeper
1181,and is that legal or not ?,Curious to dive deeper
1181," Now it isn't.  At the time there was no prohibition.  I forget who the manufacturer is, hmmm.",Curious to dive deeper
1181,why :) would You use it ? :),Surprised
1181,I think the endorsements for an Olympic gold medalist is a big incentive to win.  Do you know Canada is the only country in the world with two national sports?,Curious to dive deeper
1181,one is Hockey right ? What's the other one ?,Curious to dive deeper
1181,The other is  Lacrosse.  I believe Lacrosse comes from their French heritage.,Curious to dive deeper
1181,I had no idea... Canadians are so good in Lacrosse ?,Curious to dive deeper
1181," Must be!  National sport.  Did you know professional hockey players lose up to 8 pounds per game?  Wonder about basketball and swimming, how they measure up to that?",Curious to dive deeper
1181,I thought swimming is the sport to loose weight the quickest ?,Surprised
1181,I don't know.  I do know there is one professional Canadian team that belongs to the NBA.,Curious to dive deeper
1181," professional... basketball team ? sorry, didn't get that...",Surprised
1181," Yes, basketball.  I didn't know there was such a thing as 'bandy hockey'.",Curious to dive deeper
1181,bandy ? what is that ?,Curious to dive deeper
1181," It seems like regular ice hockey to me as it is played on ice with sticks, the only difference is it uses a ball versus a puck.",Curious to dive deeper
1181,I HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT ;) sounds very interesting. Are the goals the same size ?,Curious to dive deeper
1181,I don't know.  Interesting chat.,Curious to dive deeper
1182," Hello, I recently found out that a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck. I never thought of that before, have you?",Curious to dive deeper
1182," I guess the other types don't need one. I don't think jellyfish even have bones, and there's one species that's believed to be immortal",Neutral
1182," That is so weird, since jelly fish dry up in the sun.Even weirder, fresh water fish ""drink"" through their skin.",Curious to dive deeper
1182," Saltwater fish do too, but they also have the option of drinking through their mouths",Neutral
1182," That's weirder yet. So is knowing that 84% of genes known to be associated with human diseases, have counterparts in zebrafish. Maybe they will save humanity one day.",Curious to dive deeper
1182," Maybe, or they could be the death of us. I've heard they're poisonous",Neutral
1182," Zebrafish are? I never knew that. Are you a gamer? Evidently, Prince William is a Call of Duty fan",Curious to dive deeper
1182,I don,Neutral
1182," I only play a few of the Call of Duty, I guess there are over 33 games of it.",Curious to dive deeper
1182," I'm not a huge gamer, but I'm familiar with some of them. Apparently Black Ops 2 is worth playing since it has the best ending of all time according to the Guinness Book of World Records",Neutral
1182," I prefer Black Ops 4, it's the newest.",Neutral
1182,Didn't that just come out in October? How long did it take to make it to the end?,Curious to dive deeper
1182," Yes, it came out in October. I haven't finished it, as I am on Vault 76 & Red Dead 2. Weirdly, Iceland is rewriting their constitution, via Facebook. How odd is that?",Curious to dive deeper
1182,Not as weird as Burger King bribing people who are willing to unfriend 10 people on Facebook,Neutral
1182," That is weird, but maybe not a bad thing. Is it true that the ""like"" button is banned in Germany?",Curious to dive deeper
1182,Only in the state of Schleswig-Holstein. I wonder if anyone has moved from that state because they didn't like that rule,Curious to dive deeper
1182,I don't know. I still cannot believe that Myspace didn't buy Facebook when it had the chance.,Disgusted
1182,They didn't anticipate that Facebook would be worth $104 billion by 2012,Neutral
1182," I don't think anyone saw that coming. It's weird how the interface is blue, especially since Zuckerberg is colorblind",Curious to dive deeper
1182," Well, his colorblindness is red-green, so maybe he can see blue. It's a more appealing color compared to others either way",Neutral
1182,Maybe. Were you able to get in on their IPO in 2012?,Curious to dive deeper
1182," No, I wasn't, but I'm not surprised that the ads produce so much revenue. They can be annoying at times, but I have clicked on them from time to time",Neutral
1182," Thank you for chatting with me, have a wonderful night.",Neutral
1182,You too!,Neutral
1183,Do you play Call of Duty at all?,Curious to dive deeper
1183," Hello,  no I don't play call of duty.  I demoed the first one though.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1183," Nice, I play it a lot. I like the zombies modes. There are 33 call of duty games.",Curious to dive deeper
1183,That is crazy!  My friend works on Call of Duty so sometimes I watch them play it when it releases.  Yeah they come out with it every year.  around nov.,Curious to dive deeper
1183,That is awesome! I wish I knew a friend like that. The Guiness Books says Black ops II has the best video game ending ever! I believe it,Curious to dive deeper
1183,What is the ending?,Curious to dive deeper
1183," Just some intense battle scene where it was hard, but rewarding. It has been a while but i still get the chills",Curious to dive deeper
1183,Yikes.  Maybe youtube has a video of it.,Curious to dive deeper
1183," I bet they do, you should check it out. Prince william likes COD ",Curious to dive deeper
1183,Thats awesome!  I wonder if he goes to Gamestop and wait for the midnight release like everyone else lol,Curious to dive deeper
1183,I am sure he gets the gold plated one. I just remembered I have that game for ps3 and maybe I will replay it to see all the hype,Curious to dive deeper
1183,lol yeah the special edition ones that come in a huge box!,Curious to dive deeper
1183," at least I know when i bought it, activision donated 8 million dollars into helping relocate veterans",Curious to dive deeper
1183,Wow that is amazing!  I never knew that.  Thats really good!,Curious to dive deeper
1183,For sure! Do you like to eat fish?,Curious to dive deeper
1183," Oh yeah,  I love fish!  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1183," Me too, I stay away from jellyfish though, there is a breed that is immortal!",Curious to dive deeper
1183," lol right!  Also,  there is a type of lobster that is also immortal,  meaning if nothing kills them they could live forever....but unfortunately for them,  lobster is delicious!",Curious to dive deeper
1183,I love lobster! Good chatting with you!,Curious to dive deeper
1183," Same to you,  have a good one. ",Curious to dive deeper
1183,bye!,Curious to dive deeper
1184," hi, do you use facebook?",Curious to dive deeper
1184,I do but not as much as I used too. Do you?,Neutral
1184,Not really just sometimes. DO you know why it is blue?,Curious to dive deeper
1184,Because Zuckerburg is colorblind! did not know that,Surprised
1184,Yeah that is pretty cool. did you ever use myspace?,Curious to dive deeper
1184,I did. I cant believe tom could have bought facebook.,Surprised
1184,I kno wnad only for $75 million. bad business decision,Curious to dive deeper
1184," Facebooks ""like"" button is illegal in parts of Germany? I wonder why.",Surprised
1184,I have no idea bur very strange. And In iceland theyt are using it to rewrte the constitution,Curious to dive deeper
1184,That is so interesting!,Surprised
1184,Yeah I know. Did you hear about that burger king promotion?,Curious to dive deeper
1184,If you unfriend 10 people you get a free whopper. That is too funny.,Surprised
1184,I know haha. do you take much interest in fish?,Curious to dive deeper
1184,Do you mean the grill bearing craniate animals with lack limbs with digits?,Curious to dive deeper
1184,yup those one. did you know there is a species that ha a neck?,Curious to dive deeper
1184,No but I just heard there is an immortal breed of jellyfish.,Surprised
1184,Yeah it is the seahorse. that is cool,Curious to dive deeper
1184,Does that mean they can not be eaten?,Curious to dive deeper
1184,No they just have a eck. There is fish that can eat prey twice their size,Curious to dive deeper
1184,I prefer fish over call of duty which is a first person shooter video game franchise.,Neutral
1184,I have never played it but I guess there are 33 games?,Curious to dive deeper
1184," I have played it and always lose, I like fish better.",Neutral
1184,As well at least you tried it. Nice chatting with you,Happy
1185,Are you a video gamer?,Curious to dive deeper
1185," yes, are you on facebook?",Neutral
1185," Yes, I am on Facebook. I hardly go on it though.",Neutral
1185," Really, yes I go on a couple time a week for the news and family., How about that burger king promotion.",Neutral
1185," Do you use Facebook for families and friends who are in another state or country? I do not follow Burger King, but I heard that you get a free whopper if you unfriend 10 people. That is messed up though.",Neutral
1185," lol, yeah I agree. yes and those that live by also. Didn't know Zuckerburg has colorblindness.",Neutral
1185,That is nice to keep families and friends close together through social media. I did not know that he has colorblindness. Is there something behind the blue color?,Neutral
1185,Not sure must be easier for him to see. Zebra fish are interesting.,Neutral
1185," I know red and green are tricky. Anyways, have you seen a zebra fish?",Curious to dive deeper
1185," I probably have, can't remember have seen a lot of fish. Human diseases have counterparts in the zebra fish. The black swallower fish be a strong fish. lol",Curious to dive deeper
1185,Have you been to an aquarium? That is insane! 84% of genes associated with human diseases. That black swallower is an odd fish.,Curious to dive deeper
1185,Agree. Didn't know Prince William was a call of duty fan. Interesting,Neutral
1185,Anybody can be a fan of Call of Duty. He plays on a night shift.,Neutral
1185,Yes I know.Have you played the newest one released in 2018?,Neutral
1185," The last time I played Call of Duty was three years ago. Now, I only watch friends play it. I get headaches. Do you play it?",Curious to dive deeper
1185," lol, yes I know, I do too! It can be hard on the eyes. Did you know there were 33 of those games?",Neutral
1185,I feel that everything is moving in one screen. I get dizzy. How long has Call of Duty been active?,Curious to dive deeper
1185," Didn't know it has the best video game ending of all time, did you? Guinness book of world records.",Curious to dive deeper
1185,There is a story for Call of Duty?,Curious to dive deeper
1185," Yes, I know.  Guess Germans can't like on facebook.",Neutral
1185,Disliking is legal?,Curious to dive deeper
1185,The like button is illegal.,Neutral
1185,That is weird! How does the law find out though?,Curious to dive deeper
1185," Who knows the facebook police, lol. Seahorses having necks is interesting. didn't know that. but they do look that way.",Curious to dive deeper
1185,It was nice chatting with you.,Neutral
1186," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
1186,I'm great. How are you doing tonight?,Neutral
1186," I am well, thanks. Do you know anything about Cardi B? I do not know much about her other than she is a muscian.",Neutral
1186,Cardi B? Don't know her. Is she a new celebrity?,Neutral
1186,Kind of... She is a rapper and has a famous husband from another rap group. He cheated on her and had a huge fight. I am not proud that I know any of that...,Neutral
1186," Yes, that is the sort of drama that I am not interested in. Still not as bad as Paris Hilton, in the 2007 Guinness Book of World Records for ""most overrated celebrity""",Neutral
1186,I bet she has been in pixar's secret room for celebrities.,Happy
1186,She probably contaminated it for every else. I'm rather impressed by John Cena and his record for wishes granted with the make-a-wish foundation by any celebrity,Neutral
1186,That is really sweet. I know he may get a bad rap but that's really cool. Did you ever see aladdin?,Curious to dive deeper
1186,The animated movie with Robin Williams? A long time ago.,Curious to dive deeper
1186,Yeah. He really opened the doors for celebrities to voice over cartoons. I love trying to figure out who the voices of cartoons are.,Happy
1186," Some people are naturals. A lot of the good-looking actors are not so good with the voice. The not-so-good looking ones (Harvey Fierstein, Jon Luvitz) have great voices.",Neutral
1186," Yeah! When I listen to an actor and cant place the name, it drives me crazy. I end up going to IMDB to look it up.",Curious to dive deeper
1186,IMDB has been great for that. I wonder if it has Youtube celebrities on it. I've never checked.,Neutral
1186,Don't check. They do and they are the worst. My daughter is listening to some girl name jojo right now and she maybe the worst rapper in the history of the internet. THE WORST!,Disgusted
1186," But she could get paid by McDonalds, which has paid rappers $5 for every time they referenced Big Macs in songs",Neutral
1186,Really? I feel like that is not worth it... I would hold out for a few #1s and a few shakes.,Happy
1186," The world's fastest English language rapper, Noclue, can rap at a rate of 14.1 syllables per second. How many times can he say Big Mac in one song? Does he get paid for each instance?",Curious to dive deeper
1186,That would be great! That would be worth it. That's crazy fast!,Surprised
1186," Signing in sign language should count as well. Anyway, nice chatting with you!",Neutral
1186,Ditto!,Happy
1187,I find today's celebrities to be sort of out of touch with reality. Do you agree?,Neutral
1187," Oh yeah I can agree with that, with social media anyone can be a celebrity overnight basically as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
1187," Yeah, and with the combination of the ""American Dream"" and social media, anyone can become a celebrity without having any talents just by going viral.",Neutral
1187," Exactly, speaking of celebrities though, do you know who the first one to appear on Sesame Street was?",Curious to dive deeper
1187," I think it was Carol Burnette! I'm glad she started an awesome trend, because that show was definitely a big part of my childhood.",Happy
1187," Good call! Yeah it was her, and yeah it was for me too, that was such a quality show. ",Curious to dive deeper
1187," That's so true. I mean, even in animated films, actors used to scoff at voicing characters until Robin Williams took over the role as the Genie in Aladdin, and now every actor wants into the animated spotlight.",Surprised
1187," Yeah that is true, and I think you are right about him being the first. ",Curious to dive deeper
1187," Yeah, I think with voice acting roles, celebrities start to connect to the audience better - like they are just everyday people.",Surprised
1187,They do connect better then.  Do you know how much judge judy makes per episode on her show?,Curious to dive deeper
1187,Probably a ton! She's one of the highest paid celebrities in the world!,Curious to dive deeper
1187," I guess she gets paid $123,000 per episode!  That is crazy to me. ",Curious to dive deeper
1187," That's like a couple years salary for people! But still, aside from the money, a lot of celebrities are just normal people. For example, rapper Cardi B has underestimated how tough it was to be a mother.",Curious to dive deeper
1187,Yeah I think that she thought she would recover mentally and physically from her pregnancy faster than she did.,Curious to dive deeper
1187," Yeah, and even people like Serena Williams, one of the greatest tennis players of all-time, have struggled with that kind of stuff.",Neutral
1187,Yeah she sure is one of the greatest if not the greatest female player ever.,Curious to dive deeper
1187," male or female, she is amazing! I think she's up to 24 grand slam titles now!",Surprised
1187,Yeah that is true! Did you know she speaks French and Italian as well?,Curious to dive deeper
1187,I didn't. She's truly an awe-inspiring talent.,Sad
1187," Yeah she sure is, I didn't know that she co-owns the Miami Dolphins football team as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
1187," Yeah, neither did I. I guess she's an all-around businesswoman too!",Neutral
1187," It sounds like she is!  Well it was nice talking with you, I hope you have a good night!",Happy
1188,Sure doesn't feel like spring here. It's dumping snow.,Surprised
1188,Will Spring isn't suppose to officially start until the Vernal Equinox on March 20th but where I live it still cold then,Neutral
1188," Yeah, it really depends on the day here. I was driving around yesterday with my Jeep top open. Did you know that hiccups are a holdover from early evolution when early land animals had both gills and lungs?",Curious to dive deeper
1188,I've heard it hasn't something to do with early land animals having both gills and lungs but I've also read that it's a reflex from being a baby too,Neutral
1188," Yeah, i""m not sure if I really believe that about the evolution aspect. My understanding is things just get out of sync internally.",Curious to dive deeper
1188," Yea, I wonder what evidence they have that hiccups occur because of having both lungs and gills, seems impossible to test that",Curious to dive deeper
1188," Agreed. Did you know that under the provisions of the 1912 socttish protection of animals act, the loch ness monster is a protected species?",Curious to dive deeper
1188," No, I didn't even know Loch Ness sightings dated back to 1912 but it's nice to know it's protected if it turns out to be real",Surprised
1188," Hehe, would be pretty surprising if it turned out to be real.",Neutral
1188," Yea, and if he ever goes to Germany he will have constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights",Neutral
1188,True! Did you know a lightening bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun?,Neutral
1188,I've heard that a lightening bolt is hotter than the sun's surface but also that the sun's surface isn't the hottest part of the sun,Neutral
1188," Yep, that makes sense. Would be hotter the closer to the center you went.",Neutral
1188," What's crazy that there's a star in our galaxy 1 billion times bigger than the sun, I wonder how hot that one is",Surprised
1188,Has to be really hot. Do you think it's true there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans?,Curious to dive deeper
1188," I wouldn't be surprised, I mean there's probably a sound frequency that triggers a nerve for impending danger or something",Neutral
1188,Some holdover learned response from early man competing in a challenging environment.,Surprised
1188," Yea, maybe something scary caused humans to lose all their body hair 240,000 years ago",Curious to dive deeper
1188," Ha, ha. So the hairier you are, the less evolved?",Curious to dive deeper
1188," Maybe, maybe being hairless helps with hunting since humans are adapted for distance running",Neutral
1188,Or riding bikes or swimming really fast once you shave everywhere.,Happy
1188," Yea, it does regrow back unfortunately, but so does a human rib",Sad
1188,Amazing that ribs can grow back. I didn't know that! Too bad we can't synthesize vitamin c at the same time!,Curious to dive deeper
1188," Well I got to go, nice talking with you",Neutral
1188," Same here, have a good day!",Neutral
1188,bye,Neutral
1189," hey there, do you know much about the sun?",Curious to dive deeper
1189," hey, well I do know that the sun is actually white! it is only from our atmosphere that it appears yellow to us, what do you know about it?",Surprised
1189,I know that it is hot but not as hot a  lightening bolt.,Surprised
1189," ya somehow a lightning bolt is five times hotter than the sun, that is crazy! Poor ben franklin and his key haha",Surprised
1189," the sun is so powerful, i mean we can get all the energy we need for half a million years in just ne second",Surprised
1189," ya I wish we could just capture that and use it, our sun is small though it's only 1 billionth the size of the largest star in our galaxy",Surprised
1189,true. Neptune only competed its first full orbit around the sun in 2011 since it was discovered in 1846.,Surprised
1189,do you know anything about the timeframe when humans lost their body hair?,Curious to dive deeper
1189,it was not that long ago less than a quarter million years ago.,Curious to dive deeper
1189," right that isn't that long ago, and humans apparently are adapted for long distance running, probably to catch prey",Surprised
1189," yeah, I wonder how fast a human can go in a duel with a cheetah?",Curious to dive deeper
1189," haha good question, cheetahs can run fast but I don't think that their endurance is as good as a humans', do you get a lot of vitamin c?",Curious to dive deeper
1189," yes I try to, mainly through lemons to prevent colds and stuff. Isn't it strange that we are the only ones that cannot synthesize it?",Surprised
1189," I think that is weird, apparently our gene for making it is defective, I wonder if that could be fixed with genetic engineering",Curious to dive deeper
1189," Maybe, you never know these days with science. Did you know there is a sound frequency that instills fear in us",Surprised
1189," I heard about that, I also heard that people can regrow a rib that was removed, I had no idea that was possible",Surprised
1189," We are fully of amazing facts and mystery, really. DO you know how many species of animals are on earth?",Curious to dive deeper
1189," I think there are over 20 quintillion animals, don't ask me how many zeros are in there though haha, do you know about white patches on animals foreheads?",Curious to dive deeper
1189,does that happen when they are domesticated? I wonder what brings that about.,Surprised
1189," i agree, and I have a dog and she does not have a white patch, so it can't be 100% of the time obviously",Curious to dive deeper
1189," that is what I was thinking too. It is nice that they are so protected in countries like Germany, all animals really",Surprised
1189," yes I think they have constitutional rights in germany, I wonder what that entails, do you ever get the hiccups?",Curious to dive deeper
1189," Yeah, from time to time, they are not that much fun. It was nice chatting with you",Happy
1190,Hi how are you today?,Curious to dive deeper
1190,I'm well and you?  I am not feeling though it's spring though.,Curious to dive deeper
1190,Yes its odd seems as though spring has arrived,Curious to dive deeper
1190,It's the shortest day of the year today.,Curious to dive deeper
1190,Wow thats good I like when the days go much longer,Happy
1190," Yes, it seems to improve productivity if not sleep.",Curious to dive deeper
1190,I love when the plants emerge the best. Do u like plants?,Neutral
1190," I like plants, doesn't everyone?  I particularly like flowers.  Plants, animals, humans we all respond to the sun.",Curious to dive deeper
1190,I love them. And the variables in the time everything springs up is amazing to watch,Happy
1190,It is indeed.  The leave index for plants mirrors weather patterns.,Curious to dive deeper
1190,Yes and the way they hasve changed and emerged since records have been kept is amazing also.,Happy
1190,It is.  It is interesting that plants are now having earlier leaf-out dates.,Curious to dive deeper
1190,Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Thats mind boggling. lol,Happy
1190,It is.  I wonder how many are endangered right now out of that number?,Curious to dive deeper
1190," Its hard to say but n 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights. Thats pretty cool. ",Happy
1190," Boulder, Co legislated that you are your pets' guardian not owner.",Curious to dive deeper
1190,Interesting I think that is great.What do you think?,Neutral
1190,I think that how we treat lower species has a great deal to do with how we treat other human beings.,Curious to dive deeper
1190,Absolutely and the way people treat ani8mals says so much about them .,Happy
1190,It makes us more human if that makes any sense at all.,Curious to dive deeper
1190,Sure been good talk to ya later,Happy
1191," Hello,  do you like animals?",Curious to dive deeper
1191," I like animals, did you know there's a lawyer in Switzerland who represents animals in court? how crazy is that",Curious to dive deeper
1191," Thats really cool,  someone has to stand up for their right!  I wonder how he gets paid though lol ",Curious to dive deeper
1191," Yeah its not like animals carry much cash lol, that is an interesting question he might do it out of the love for them",Curious to dive deeper
1191,Did you know there is 20 quintillion species of animals?,Curious to dive deeper
1191," That much? I dint know, there are 7 million species in total so that's crazy!!",Surprised
1191," oops,  I meant animals sorry.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1191," No problem, I got it out of context, interesting how animals also speak different languages in different geographical areas over the world",Curious to dive deeper
1191," Yeah that kinda interesting,  I guess it makes sense though,  they dont know about animals on the other side of the world lol well maybe birds do because they fly everywhere",Curious to dive deeper
1191," Birds are free, they can fly and fly for miles, interesting how animals also have a dominant paw.",Curious to dive deeper
1191,yeah my dog is a righty.  She does a lot of tricks with her right paw first.,Curious to dive deeper
1191," Sounds like you are a dog person, thats great I have a dog as well. The Netherlands protect animals, they build a special bridge for wildlife",Curious to dive deeper
1191," Awesome what kind of dog do you have?  That is really cool,  In Scotland the loch ness monster is a protected species.",Curious to dive deeper
1191," Thats cool we wouldn't want to scare Nessie away, anyways what are your thoughts on the sun? I think its amazing",Curious to dive deeper
1191,I think its funny that the sun is actually white.  I feel like all the pictures in the world are wrong lol,Curious to dive deeper
1191," I guess my kinder garden teacher tricked me all this time lol, the sunset on Mars is actually blue how cool is that",Surprised
1191,That would be amazing to see.!,Curious to dive deeper
1191," Yeah, really beautiful, such a great landscape the sun makes 99.86% of the mass in our solar system",Surprised
1191," I hear the sun can produce enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the planet for 500,000 years. ",Curious to dive deeper
1191," We should really use solar energy more, that the future, if we can really learn how to harness it our energetic problems would be over and the planet would appreciate it. ",Happy
1191," i agree!  Its been really fun talking with you,  excellent conversation,  thank you. ",Neutral
1192," Hi , do you know about celebrities?",Curious to dive deeper
1192," Some i do.  For example, I know that Judge Judy makes 123.000 per episode of her TV show.  Can you believe that?",Neutral
1192,That is a lot!! It looks like only LeBron james earns more than her!,Curious to dive deeper
1192,Do you like Lebron James?,Curious to dive deeper
1192,I think he is great! Remember Robin williams?,Surprised
1192," Sure do, I watched Mork and Mindy as a kid.  I also loved his movie, Mrs. Doubtfire.",Curious to dive deeper
1192,I loved ms Doubfire too!! He also was the first famous actor to do voices in animated films!,Happy
1192," That's interesting.  Speaking of celebrity firsts, did you know Carol Burnett was the first celeb on Sesame Street?",Curious to dive deeper
1192," It looks like, she was the first one. And Robin williams did a voice in aladdin, remember that?",Happy
1192," I do.  I also liked Good Will Hunting and Good Morning, Vietnam",Neutral
1192," Cool, talking about animated, did you know Pixar has a room for celebrities?",Happy
1192," No, i did not.  I wonder what happens in this room. ",Curious to dive deeper
1192," I saw it once in the bonus features of Toy story, is pretty cool!",Happy
1192,Do you like Serena Williams?,Curious to dive deeper
1192," Yes, and I love tennis, I did not know she was of the owners of Miami Dolphins",Happy
1192," Yes, i did hear that.  I think the Dolphins have a few celebrity minority owners.",Curious to dive deeper
1192,she is also good with languages! she speaks french and Italian fluently!,Happy
1192," That is impressive, almost as impressive as winning the Australian Open while two months pregnant!",Surprised
1192,That is amazing!!! she has been number 1 on 2002 and 2017!,Happy
1192,It is so incredible that she has been so good for so long.,Surprised
1192,It is true!! It has been nice talking to you!,Happy
1193,Do you like rap?,Curious to dive deeper
1193," Not really, I used to listen to Eminem though, did you know he wanted to be a comic book artist?",Curious to dive deeper
1193," Interesting! And his favorite superhero was Spiderman! I prefer Tupac actually, though.",Happy
1193," That's cool. I heard his music is in the library of congress of ""cultural significance.""",Neutral
1193,Cool. Would you listen to a compliment battle?,Curious to dive deeper
1193,I was actually just thinking that would be cool to try out. Didn't Korean rappers invent that?,Curious to dive deeper
1193," Yes, you are correct! I guess rap has become really mainstream. A Michigan Judge once delivered her ruling in rap form. That was a suit filed against rapper eminem.",Surprised
1193," I heard about that, that would have been amusing to see. Do you like any other celebrities? I like watching Judge Judy from time to time.",Curious to dive deeper
1193,She is quite the character! She makes over 100 K per episode.,Surprised
1193," Yea, she is the second highest paid celebrity. Lebron James is number 1.",Curious to dive deeper
1193," That is surprising. And to answer your question, no I do not have any favorite celebrities, though I would love to be one just so I could visit Pixar studio's secret room.",Sad
1193," I know, me too. That is cool. I also like Robin Williams, he was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films.",Neutral
1193," We really like our celebrities, so much that they need to show up on Sesame Street. Carol Burnett was the first one.",Surprised
1193,I heard about that. What do you think about Serena Williams? Her and her sister both speak fluent italian and french.,Curious to dive deeper
1193,I think she's an awesome athlete. I just found out that she is co-owner of the Miami Dolphins.,Surprised
1193," Yea, I just found out about that too. I also just found out that she won her 23rd grand slam tournament while two months pregnant.",Curious to dive deeper
1193," Wow, awesome! She is so tough! She didn't even drop a single set.",Surprised
1193," I know. Her and her sister thought they could beat any man ranked 200 or worse, but lost to karsten braasch who was ranked 203 though.",Neutral
1193,That's sad. If anyone could do it I would have bet on them.,Sad
1193," I know, right? That was back in 1998 though.",Neutral
1193," Yes, let's have a rematch! Haha!",Happy
1194,Have you heard about the hs teacher in FL who had students help him drown raccoons in class?,Curious to dive deeper
1194,Yes.  That must have been traumatic for the kids and against the law too.,Neutral
1194," Traumatic, I'm sure, for the student who shot a video broadcast on an Orlando TV station. The teacher was a long-time, 34 year veteran teacher in Ocala, FL.",Curious to dive deeper
1194,I can understand that the raccoons were a problem.  They were killing chickens.  But he obviously had trapped them.  He should have taken them to the woods many miles away.,Neutral
1194,Exactly. That's what we'd do in my rural area of the northeast. Most people understand that raccoons can be pests.,Neutral
1194," Apparently the law would have allowed humane euthanasia, but I don't know that methods are considered humane.",Neutral
1194,It's certainly humane to relocate animals if possible. Can't you just imagine the range of comments this event brought out on Facebook?,Curious to dive deeper
1194,I am sure it went viral.  You know the color scheme on Facebook is largely blue because its founder is red-green colorblind.,Neutral
1194," Shame Zuckerberg can't see green because he has a LOT of ""green"" most of us will never see.",Neutral
1194,True.  But we won't have to testify before Congress either. Facebook sure had humble beginnings with its start in a few colleges.,Neutral
1194," Absolutely. Launched in 2004. Over 1 million registered users by, I believe, 2006 or 2007. Public offering in 2012. That's fast growth.",Curious to dive deeper
1194,I love it that Americans continue to create such value like that and Google and Amazon.  Last year Facebook had 2.2 billion users who are active.,Neutral
1194," I didn't know that. I'm beginning to become wary of these new ""giants"" of the information age. Facebook has surged eons ahead of the book of faces in collegiate directories, hasn't it?",Neutral
1194,Yes.  Myspace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for $75 million.  Blockbuster also turned down an offer to buy Netflix for $50 million.  Both of the potential buyers are now gone or nearly gone.,Neutral
1194,I'll be somebody out there is rueful today about their decision in 2005 (MySpace) not to purchase Facebook.,Curious to dive deeper
1194," Undoubtedly.  I wish I could relive 2008 over and get my money out of the stock market before it crashed.  I read that the ""like"" button is illegal in one German state.",Neutral
1194," Sorry about your financial loss. Impossible to ""like"" in any way. Maybe the German restrictions make some sense.",Neutral
1194,I just said it to demonstrate that there are many people with financial regrets. Did you know that a seahorse is the only fish with a neck?,Neutral
1194," Funky. The only fish I know well are trout, bass and catfish, all considered olfactores, I believe. (No limbs with digits).",Curious to dive deeper
1194," Those are all fresh water fish, which means that they ""drink"" water through their skins rather than their mouths.",Neutral
1194," Yes. I've never done ocean fishing, but I'd love to catch a small shark and prepare a meal with it right on deck. Saltwater fish like sharks drink, too, through gills and their mouths. Wanna put a tasty shark in my mouth. I've been told they're delicious.",Curious to dive deeper
1194," My problem with deep sea fishing is I like to be in control.  When I want to go to shore, I want to go now.  There is a breed of jellyfish that is supposed to be immortal.  I guess whoever said that does not know the second law of thermodynamics which states that entropy is increasing.  That means that all particles in the universe will someday be moving in a random way.  No jellyfish then.",Neutral
1194," As far as I can see, a lot of things in my universe are moving randomly already. In the election of 2020, I hope that course can be corrected! Good to speak with you. Thanks.",Neutral
1194,Likewise.  Bye.,Neutral
1195,Hi. Do you like trivia about the ocean? Did you know there is breed of jellyfish that is immortal?,Curious to dive deeper
1195," Actually I do, I read about that jellyfish, when it sense danger it regresses in age and becomes a child, grows until more danger, regresses, really crazy. How about hanako the koi who lived for 226 years. He outlived 4-5 generations of that family.",Curious to dive deeper
1195,Wow. That is so interesting. The only fish to have a neck is the seahorse.,Surprised
1195," Yes, they are odd looking on many levels. Speaking of water, did you read about that teacher in Ocala, Florida drowned two raccoons and a opossum in front of his students. No wonder he's on leave, sounds like he's in the wrong business.",Curious to dive deeper
1195,That is awful. I don't understand how that would help children learn. Too bad he wasn't the right size to be eaten by a black swallower fish. They can eat prey twice its length and 10 times its weight.,Surprised
1195," haha..yes. They were eating the classes chickens, seems like he should have trapped them and released miles away. How about that goldfish who lived to 43, you don't hear of many middle aged goldfish.",Curious to dive deeper
1195," I thought it was impressive that my goldfish live to 5. I just learned because it was a fresh water fish, it ""drank"" water through its skin via osmosis.",Surprised
1195," Wow, you know a lot more about fish than I do, have you seen through the barreleye fish's transparent head? Does it not have a brain at all?",Curious to dive deeper
1195,Some fish are basically just nervous systems. It is so interesting. It is odd that 84 percent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in zebrafish.,Surprised
1195," Wow, I wonder if they're used in medical research. That an astounding number compared to different species. Are you a Facebook user at all, I think I'm the only human not on Facebook, my wife loves it. Did you know one third of divorce filings mention 'Facebook', that isn't good.",Curious to dive deeper
1195,Oh that is terrible. I have an account but rarely use it. I do remember when it first came out and was just used for higher education institutions and Ivy league schools.,Neutral
1195," Yes, they made a move about that didn't they? Started at Harvard, expanded to schools...the world. I can't believe 30% of Americans use it as their primary news source. I thought it was just for keeping up with friends and family.",Curious to dive deeper
1195,I wonder what the total number of users are. Myspace could have bough facebook for $75 million in 2005.,Surprised
1195," Yes, shocking. I missed a few investment opportunities in my life, but nothing that big. Just wow. you see where they have 56 customer gender categories plus male and female. That boggles the mind.",Curious to dive deeper
1195,That is a lot of options. I prefer to keep things simple. Kind of like the color choices for the facebook layout. They chose blue because Mark Zuckerberg has red-green colorblindness.,Neutral
1195," I didn't know that, did you know there are more people on Facebook than there were humans on earth 200 years ago. Thank goodness I'm not on, it might be human's  on earth 100 years ago.",Curious to dive deeper
1195,Wow. What an amazing fact! And here I was excited that Burger King had a promotion where if you unfriend 10 people you get a free whopper.,Happy
1195," Funny, I eat at Burger King today. Have you ever played Call of Duty? I haven't it too violent, but people have put in 25 billions hours (2.85 million years) of game playtime, longer than the course of human existence.",Curious to dive deeper
1195,Wow. There are 33 Call of Duty games and I have played zero.,Curious to dive deeper
1195," We're at the same zero level then, though Price William played on night shirt with the RAF, I guess that more relevant if you a soldier.",Curious to dive deeper
1195,Well thanks so much for chatting. I learned a lot of new and fun information today.,Happy
1195," So did I, thank you it was an enjoyable chat.",Happy
1195,Keep learning and enjoying great stories like 43 year old goldfish. Goodbye,Happy
1196,Hi There ! Looking forward to chat with You !,Happy
1196,Same here. I was not aware that Myspace passed on the opportunity to buy facebook. That was not a smart decision.,Curious to dive deeper
1196,From time perspective - absolutely not ;) Facebook really grew ! Did You ever had MySpace account ?,Curious to dive deeper
1196," I did, but not for a very long time, and then it was out of sight pretty soon after Facebook. ",Neutral
1196,Yeah after Facebook got so popular all other social media got forgotten...,Curious to dive deeper
1196," Pretty much. Just reading through the article here though, the Burger King promotion, wow, I wonder how much rift that may have caused between people",Surprised
1196," I don't think many people actually did it ;) I mean can You ""friend"" back people from Your ""Unfriended"" list ?",Curious to dive deeper
1196," I would think so, I do not think there is a ban on that. Just wondering why they would launch that king of promotion, it is not very positive",Neutral
1196,I guess... I've never actually tried that ;),Curious to dive deeper
1196," Yeah me either. Either way, I guess companies need to be creative on how they use social media to get attention from users",Neutral
1196," Facebook's ""like"" button is illegal in the german state of schleswig-holstein - I wonder why",Curious to dive deeper
1196,Yeah that is a curiosity indeed. I cannot think of a reason though.,Surprised
1196,Hmm.... maybe it's worth investigating ;),Curious to dive deeper
1196,Maybe. I find Iceland's use of Facebook even more interesting. Talk about transparent government.,Curious to dive deeper
1196,What do You mean by that ?,Curious to dive deeper
1196," They are putting the constitution out there for everyone to have input, not just those who hold certain positions",Happy
1196,Everyone ? Like regular people ?,Curious to dive deeper
1196," Yes, all citizens of Iceland can make suggestions and alterations to it",Happy
1196,Seems unbelievable !  Hopefully somebody is actually reading those suggestions ! ;),Curious to dive deeper
1196," Considering how things are in Iceland and how happy people are there with their government, they probably are. On another topic, more connected to nature, I have always found it intriguing the jellyfish that never dies and keeps regenerating",Surprised
1196,What ? Immortal Jellyfish ? How come we haven't steal that property form them yet ?,Surprised
1196," Trust me, there is so much research going on that but scientists have not been able to pinpoint yet how they do it",Surprised
1196," I don't believe that :) I think there is couple of scientists who figured it out, but they kept it to themselves and they are immortal ! :) ",Happy
1196," I don't know, that would unleash a whole new potential for humanity.",Curious to dive deeper
1196,I don't think our planet is ready for that :),Curious to dive deeper
1196," Not at all, we are overpopulated as it is, it would be chaos.",Surprised
1196," yes it would :) looking forward to it ! :) people would start sword fighting like in ""Highlander"" ;) lol",Happy
1196,hahah true story. And then how about the seahorse being the only fish with a neck. Way to stand out in the crowd,Surprised
1196,lol ;) hey thanks for chatting ! It was a pleasure ! :),Happy
1196,Same here. Have a nice day.,Happy
1197," hello,  do you use Facebook?",Curious to dive deeper
1197,I do have a FB account. I try to avoid it when I can. Maybe we should ban it. Facebook's like button is illegal in one German state.,Surprised
1197,lol yeah I heard I wonder whats up with that?  Is it the thumbs up they dont like?  I hear Myspace had an offer to buy facebook in 2005!,Curious to dive deeper
1197,I bet they are regretting that. They could have bought it for $75 million and it's now worth 2.2 billion.,Surprised
1197," I know right,  missed opportunity!  I hear Burger king had a promotion to give a free whopper to people who unfriend 10 people lol would you do it?",Curious to dive deeper
1197,Haha I totally should so I will spend less time on FB!,Surprised
1197,Do you find fish interesting?  I love sea life.  did you know the black swallow can eat its prey dd2 times its length and 10 times its weight?  That is insanely cool!,Curious to dive deeper
1197,Yeah I think fish are cool! I'd love to learn more about the immortal jellyfish.,Curious to dive deeper
1197," Ive seen it on the discovery channel lol theres also an immortal lobster!  Immortal meaning that if nothing kills it,  it has the ability to live forever.  Since, lobster is so delicious its probably not going to live forever lol",Curious to dive deeper
1197," Haha, really? That's interesting. And funny. I wonder why the zebrafish has 84 percent of genes associated with human diseases?",Curious to dive deeper
1197,Yikes thats weird.,Curious to dive deeper
1197," Yes, I will stay away from that fish, k thx. I think seahorses are another cool fish, so pretty. They are the only fish with a neck.",Curious to dive deeper
1197,Nice!  I also think its interesting that the male seahorse carries the baby!  weird right!,Curious to dive deeper
1197,Interesting! So do you like other animals? What about raccoons?,Curious to dive deeper
1197," I also read that seahorses have no teeth or stomachs,  their food passes through them almost instantly and have to constantly eat!  They also are not strong swimmers and can die from exhaustion!  Raccoons are cute,  but I dont like them much. ",Curious to dive deeper
1197,I heard this horrible story about a teacher from florida killing raccoons in class.,Curious to dive deeper
1197,That is disgusting!,Curious to dive deeper
1197," Yeah, apparently the teacher made his students do that because the raccoons were killing chickens that they were raising for the class.",Surprised
1197," Yup,  read that.  People are so weird,  i wonder what is going through their minds sometimes.  Why is killing the raccoon the first thought,  why not "" how can I better protect my chickens?""  and why does he have some student help him?",Curious to dive deeper
1197,Can't imagine why he got the students involved.,Surprised
1197,seriously!  Why have this even in the classroom with the students involved. So depressing.,Curious to dive deeper
1197," Yeah, apparently he thought the raccoon might be rabid but still does not explain getting students involved.",Surprised
1198," Hi, do you like to travel?",Curious to dive deeper
1198," Hi, I do. One of my favorite things to do. what about you?",Happy
1198,I love traveling myself. Did you know the Dutch are creating a bus system that travels at 160mph?,Surprised
1198,That is pretty fast. I would love to ride it!. Have you been to Japan?,Happy
1198,I have not been to Japan. Have you?,Curious to dive deeper
1198," i have not, but when one goes have to save money for the tolls!",Happy
1198,Yea that's crazy. Looks like it cost $300 to cross the country.,Surprised
1198,I bet those are beautiful highways! did yo know there is a website where yo ca find people who will let you sleep in their couch?,Happy
1198,I did not know that. I definitely would not take advantage of that website lol.,Surprised
1198," I agree I wouldn't either! There are people who do strange things, when traveling, like stealing gnomes!",Happy
1198,LOL that's pretty funny! Iceland has no public rail system so most people just travel by air in the country.,Surprised
1198," that is cool!Did you know that back in the age of discovery, people is ships released rabbits in the islands? Do you know why?",Happy
1198,I did not know that. Why did they do that?,Curious to dive deeper
1198," It was thinking of future travelers , as a food source for them... that was sort of nice!",Happy
1198,That is very nice of them. Do you get into politics?,Curious to dive deeper
1198,Not much! but there are funny facts about politics!,Happy
1198,I agree. Politicians in Kentucky must swear an oath that they have never participated in a duel before.,Surprised
1198," Really? I found very funny hurricanes in Australia were named after politicians, weather men did not like!",Happy
1198,That's pretty funny. I didn't know that about Australia either.,Surprised
1198,did you know in the 60's there was a movement to replace politicians with scientist and engineers?,Happy
1198,I did not know that. It was great talking to you.,Happy
1199," Hi, do you like to travel?",Curious to dive deeper
1199,Yea I love to travel when I can. I'd like to visit Japan but wouldn't want to spend $300 in tolls travelling the country,Neutral
1199,That is a lot of yen lol.  I might be worth it if you can go 160mph like the dutch.,Curious to dive deeper
1199," I love to go on a 160 mph dutch bus, I wonder how safe it will be",Curious to dive deeper
1199,I never hear about any accidents so I guess it is safe!,Curious to dive deeper
1199,Maybe Iceland can adopt it since they have no public rail service,Neutral
1199,Machinac Island has banned motorized vehicles completely including any type of bus for 100 years,Curious to dive deeper
1199," Thats odd but I guess it would be nice to ride horse drawn carriages on a vacation on Mackinac Island, definitely couldn't do it for like more than a week",Neutral
1199,You can ride bikes there too.,Curious to dive deeper
1199,That sounds pretty fun. Did you know the first king to travel the world was King Kalakuana of Hawaii?,Curious to dive deeper
1199,He must have done it by boat!,Curious to dive deeper
1199," Speaking of politics, did you know Poiticians in Kentucky must swear an oath they've never been in a duel? Why is that a law there lol",Surprised
1199,Somebody must have pulled out a sword during a debate haha.  Some politician gain office by removing others from office.,Curious to dive deeper
1199," Not surprising. Venice selected their politicians by lottery during the Middle ages, they couldn't of been worse off as the US is now",Neutral
1199," Haha,  Thats a good one.  Venice was successful though.",Curious to dive deeper
1199,Maybe some states will try it one day. Did you know President Buchanan had a boyfriend? Pretty progressive,Curious to dive deeper
1199,His better half I heard.,Curious to dive deeper
1199,Would James Buchanan's boyfriend qualify as the first gentleman?,Curious to dive deeper
1199,Did you know Chicago is known as the windy city due to talkative politicians not the weather?,Curious to dive deeper
1199,I didn't but Chicago does have a reputation for their politicians so it's not far fetched,Neutral
1199,Very funny.  Have a good night!,Happy
1200,hi how are you? do you like to travel?,Neutral
1200,I love to travel! Going to Brazil in 2 months. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
1200," I love travel, but i usually dont have the time or money to travel. brazil! that is great.",Neutral
1200," I can't wait, never been there. I want to go to Iceland next, I heard you have to fly everywhere though",Curious to dive deeper
1200," yeah, it must be hard to build a rail system on that terrain. ",Neutral
1200," that is a good point, I never thought of that. i will still go and get over my fear of short flights in small planes lol. Have you been to mackinac island?",Curious to dive deeper
1200," i have not. that is the place with no cars? a great place to unwind, i imagine. ",Neutral
1200,I bet. I think you can only walk or get around on horse back,Curious to dive deeper
1200,That would be great. people would slow down. maybe even give up their phones for a while. unplug.,Neutral
1200," That is a good point, maybe I need to take my family there. It would be soothing and I don't think it is too hard from me. I could take the dutch commuter bus that goes 160 mph and get there really quick",Curious to dive deeper
1200," Yeah, that bus sounds like a great way to get to work. get there fast, less stress. awesome!",Neutral
1200," For sure, I wonder how safe it is to travel that fast on a bus, what do you think",Curious to dive deeper
1200,I figure that they have seatbeats. plus maybe a separate lane for the bus. then they dont worry about collisions so much.,Neutral
1200,I hope so too. Do you have any favorite clothing to wear when you travel?,Curious to dive deeper
1200," I usually dress casually. i prefer to relax while traveling. i prefer flying for long distance, but trains for shorter ones.",Neutral
1200,I like casual attire too. Did you know apple had a clothing line in 1986,Curious to dive deeper
1200,I cant imagine. who would wear those clothes back then? programmers? geeks? LOL,Neutral
1200," Right lol, I wonder how bad it was if it was just one year. I am sure you can get some on ebay lol",Curious to dive deeper
1200," I bet you could. show off to your fellow geeks and programmers! classic style! anyway, great chat!",Neutral
1200," For sure! It was so great chatting with you, enjoy your night!",Curious to dive deeper
1200,Have a good night!,Neutral
1200,Thanks!,Curious to dive deeper
1201,Hey there what do you think about the United States Senate,Curious to dive deeper
1201,The Senate is the highest legislative body in the land. It provides employment to some of the richest people in the country.,Neutral
1201," Yep you're right. There are 100 US senators. Interesting that Senators used to be appointed by the states, but now they are elected by the people",Surprised
1201," Elections might not have solved the problem. In 1988, a chimpanzee received 400.000 votes in a mayoral election in Rio de Janeiro, coming in third place. Is that chimp still around? Can we get him?",Neutral
1201,Haha he doesn't sound that bad. He sounds actually very popular haha. Very crazy that Richard Nixon broke a 160 five-year-old gavel,Surprised
1201,Nixon was never very good with his hands.,Neutral
1201,Haha that's a good point. Apparently there is a candy desk in the US Senate. It's been there since 1968. I want to attack that desk eat all the candy haha,Happy
1201,I wonder why that got started. Candy? Should be eating healthy food. Attitudes need to change. Even in 2000 40 percent of Alabamans voted to keep the state's unenforceable ban on interracial marriage. It's good to see progress south of the Mason-Dixon line.,Neutral
1201,Yeah that's sad. A lot of those Senators need to get healthier. Also sad is that women were not allowed to wear pants in the Senate until 1993,Surprised
1201," I bet if chimpanzees got elected to senate, they would face a similar battle over clothing. ",Neutral
1201," If chimpanzees got elected to the Senate that would probably be the least of our worries haha, can you believe the Indian government set up a polling booth for just one person",Surprised
1201," I guess there is a legal obligation. If chimps could vote in the jungle, that chimp would have gotten elected mayor in Brazil  ",Neutral
1201,Yeah I guess I could see that. What is insane is that men in the UK had to wait until 1918 before all of them could vote. Like how is that a thing,Surprised
1201,People without money were seen as a threat to gov't by the rich. Now many people are not allowed to vote in the US.,Neutral
1201,Nope I've heard that. Speaking of that 34% of the Alabama male population has permanently lost the right to vote,Surprised
1201,That's fishy. That should be changed. JFK voted against the 1957 civil rights act. I wonder what he was thinking then. It sounds like Alabama hasn't changed much.,Neutral
1201,That is shocking about JFK. I get a laugh that the citizens of Austin Texas rename their garbage dump Fred Durst after a vote LOL,Happy
1201," A way to enter the annals of history, that's for sure. It would be great to have someone like Harry Truman again. He really put the kibosh on corruption and waste.",Neutral
1201,Yeah he was a great president. Do you go to concerts at all? I know that Linkin Park does like 320 tours a year,Curious to dive deeper
1201," Linkin Park is gone, as far as I know. They lost a member and that ended the band.",Neutral
1201,Oh I didn't know that. What about the Ramones do you like them? I guess they did like 2000 concerts in 20 years,Surprised
1202,Can you imagine spending millions of dollars on suits?,Curious to dive deeper
1202,I can not imagine. I like nice clothes but dont think it should costme more than i make.,Neutral
1202,Apparently some people spend a million bucks to buy one blue and one grey suit that aren't all that flattering.,Surprised
1202,I would probably rather shop at the store in alabama that sells clothes cameras and what ever else is found in unclaimed luggage.,Neutral
1202,But what about the ostrich jacket? Or maybe you could find one at that store in Alabama.,Curious to dive deeper
1202,ostrich jacket is funny. I wonder if he had the shoes to match.,Curious to dive deeper
1202," They also have a python jacket. I'm confused, is that a real Python? And how many Pythons would you need to make a Python jacket?",Curious to dive deeper
1202," I don't know, if you use different pythons does the pattern change?",Curious to dive deeper
1202," Yeah, maybe it would end up somewhat striped. I wonder if the jacket would need to get tailored further or if the high price tag includes the tailoring. Fashion and style aficionados look for collar gaps on clothing to see if you get your clothes tailored or not.",Curious to dive deeper
1202,For that price it better look right. I wonder if Apple clothing from 1986 is worth anything today?,Curious to dive deeper
1202," Probably. Speaking of clothing brands, would you buy Rip Curl? Some of its clothes are made in Nort Korea but the label says made in China.",Curious to dive deeper
1202,I have some rip curl now i'm curious as to where it was made.,Curious to dive deeper
1202,So back in the Pilgrim's time I guess everyone got clothes tailored so it was not anything fancy. Their clothes were actually colorful. I always thought they were black.,Surprised
1202,They did wear black but it was only for special events.,Neutral
1202,So only humans wear clothes. I wonder why. But actually it is cute when humans place little sweaters on tiny little dogs.,Curious to dive deeper
1202,I find it odd when people dress up animals. its like when someone manages to impersonate a goverment offical before being caught. Like a man in france who even got to sell the eiffel tower twice.,Surprised
1202," Well he must be pretty smart if he got that far. What do you think about the witty thing Oscar Wilde would say upon arrival to U.S. Customs? ""I have nothig to declare except my genius.""",Curious to dive deeper
1202," I like wildes famous last ""my wallpaper and i are fighting a duel to the death. one or other of us has got to go""",Happy
1202," Wow, I can't imagine being that witty when I'm about to die. Haha.",Surprised
1202,Can you believe kissing wildes lipstick covered tomb could get you a fine of $12000,Surprised
1202," I would probably take selfie of myself pretending to kiss the tomb. Sounds pretty gross to kiss a tomb, let alone one that's been kissed by thousands of other people. Well, going to go research that more. Have a good night!",Surprised
1203," hi, do you know much about the us senate?",Curious to dive deeper
1203," well I do know that Nixon cracked a 165 year old senate gavel haha, what about yoU?",Happy
1203,hahhaa that is funny. i know they have a drawer with candy,Curious to dive deeper
1203," haha I wonder what kind of candy personally, I guess that was started in 1968, now im hungry haha",Surprised
1203,yeah lucky them. only candy made in pensylvania it seems,Curious to dive deeper
1203," oh interesting, well I do love Milky Ways and Mars bars, Hershey's is made in Pennsylvannia too",Surprised
1203," yeah and on top of that, jellybeans as well",Curious to dive deeper
1203,pretty dumb that women couldnt wear pants until 1993 in the senate what do you think?,Surprised
1203," yeah that is trange, good think those two staged a protest",Curious to dive deeper
1203," yup it was Barbara Mikulski and Carol Moseley, good for them!",Happy
1203," yeah, revolutionaries. did you know Jordan was asked why he did not endorse a fellow black candidate, democrat?",Curious to dive deeper
1203," I heard about that, he said ""because republicans buy shoes too"" and i like that, celebs should stay out of politics",Happy
1203," yup and he is a business man, so he knows how that is done",Curious to dive deeper
1203," yup he wasn't fooled, did you vote in the last election?",Curious to dive deeper
1203,yes I did. did you?,Curious to dive deeper
1203," I did too, I guess astronauts vote from space? I definitely didn't know that",Surprised
1203," yeah they vote from there, and we do not bother to vote from here, at least not all of us",Curious to dive deeper
1203," nope, not everyone can vote either I guess 34% of black men in Alabama have lost the right to vote",Surprised
1203,I wonder why that is ? felony laws?,Curious to dive deeper
1203," ya thats what I'm assuming, scary though that not all men could vote in britain until the year 1918",Surprised
1203," yeah, wonder what prevented them from voting",Curious to dive deeper
1203," ya I wondered the same, did you hear that the indian gov built a polling location in the woods for a single man?",Surprised
1203," wow, that must have been scary. nice chat",Happy
1204,Are you a Star Wars fan?,Curious to dive deeper
1204,I enjoy a solid epic space opera franchise.,Happy
1204," I enjoyed it to, preferable those from George Lucas, before the Disney acquisition.  Is it not interesting that in some way, they seem to foretell events of today? ",Curious to dive deeper
1204," Marcia Lucas, George's former wife helped, so perhaps she had future visions.",Surprised
1204," The underlining theme of Episode 1, trade tariffs is an ongoing issue in the world today.  While fictional, it was probably more complex on a galactic scale.  Still, Trump is doing his part, on a smaller planetary scale.",Curious to dive deeper
1204,I don't know much about the original trilogy.     I do enjoy the original two sequels though.,Happy
1204," I enjoyed them all, but prefer the original trilogy.  Did you know that 20th Century Fox thought it was going to flop and negotiated an exit deal with George Lucas in which he retained the licensing and merchandising rights.  They lost (and Lucas gained) billions.",Neutral
1204,I heard that.     I was more surprised that the films had a combined box office revenue over $8.5 billion.,Surprised
1204," Truly amazing.  I wonder how long they can keep it going and keep it fresh?  They seemed to have stumbled with Solo: A Star Wars Story.  I hope they can regain their footing.  All in all, the Star Wars franchise value was estimated at $ 65 billion.",Curious to dive deeper
1204,That is difficult to believe!  I wish I knew more about Darth Sidious from Episode I and Solo.,Happy
1204," Some equate Dark Sidious with Vladimir Putin.  I can see some parallel.  In some sense, Putin is trying to exert influence, if not take over the world through military might.  Dark Sidious is following a parallel track on a galactic scale.",Neutral
1204," Jupiter's moon, Ganymede is larger than many planets in the Star Wars Universe.",Surprised
1204," Then Ganymeade might have been a planet had it orbited a Sun instead of Jupiter.  The term ""planet""  is an interesting and arbitrary term.  For example Pluto was a planet for more than 75 years, then it was decided that it was no longer a planet.",Curious to dive deeper
1204," Yes, even in our system they are quite different!    Venus does not tilt and has no seasons!",Surprised
1204," Its also interesting that it rotates clockwise, opposite the other planets.  But it is not the only oddity.  Uranus rotates sideways and rolls around the sun rather than rotate around an axis like earth.",Neutral
1204,Such facts make one think about the vastness of space!   We believe there may be the building blocks of life on a planet nearly 500 light years from earth.,Surprised
1204," So true.  But sometimes, the mysteries can be closer to home.  For example, Pink Floyd recorded a live concert in an ancient roman amphitheater in Pompeii without a live audience.  How can it be live if their is no one live that is listening?",Curious to dive deeper
1204,I would guess some of the Ramones 2263 concerts were in bars with almost no listeners!,Happy
1204,Probably true.  They sure have been around a long time.  Some acts are almost always touring while some spend more time in the recording studios.  I tend to be more into classical music myself.  Did you know Star Wars' music was performed by classical musicians as part of a series of concerts called Star Wars: A Musical Journey and later Star Wars: In Concert?,Curious to dive deeper
1204,No I didn't.     I just heard about the Creed concert that resulted in a lawsuit against the band.    Sounds like something terrible!,Surprised
1204," They were never really my style.  I wonder what aliens think of our music?  In the 1970s. NASA sent out a satellite which included a ""gold record"" in the style of vinyl LPs with a selection of classical music.   I guess we are still waiting for feedback.  Its been good chatting with you.",Curious to dive deeper
1204,Who knows!    Thanks for the chat.    I want to go see some pictures from the Kepler Space Telescope.,Happy
1205," Hi, how are you doing tonight?",Neutral
1205,Pretty good.  Can you believe that the Trump tariffs are adding some credibility to Star Wars?,Neutral
1205,What? That's funny. Which Star Wars movie?,Neutral
1205,Star Wars: Episode 1- The Phantom Menace.  The episode starts with the words that trade route taxation is in dispute.,Neutral
1205," Oh, I see. Yeah, I could see the connection with Trump. But there has always been trade friction. COuld be any president frankly.",Neutral
1205," Most US Presidents have not done much about tariffs.  However, tariffs have never escalated to a shooting war.  Economists are not that violent.",Neutral
1205,True. I hope that it doesn't come to that. The planet probably can't take too much war.,Neutral
1205," I believe that even China will pay their $250 million in tariffs rather than have nuclear bombs on their country.  They won't have to either.  They will just have to treat us more fairly.  Anyhow, it is neat to see a movie become relevant like this.",Neutral
1205,And certainly not the movie that I would have expected. Star Wars just seemed to be about the Force and stuff. Hm. Interesting connection.,Neutral
1205,Exactly.  Somebody was doing more thinking that we thought when they mentioned tariffs.,Neutral
1205,Are you a fan of Star Wars in general? I liked the first three films myself.,Curious to dive deeper
1205," I enjoyed them in their early years, but my interest kind of faded.  They call it a space opera, a play on the term ""soap opera"".  It is the highest grossing film series of all time.",Neutral
1205," That makes sense. Yeah, the term space opera is better. It's not sci-fi, not like 2001:Space Odyssey. I enjoyed the rousing adventure of the early films. I'm impressed by Marcia Lucas' contribution.",Neutral
1205," Yes.  I think it is an art form unto itself.  Also, it set a Guinness World Record for merchandising, with theme parks, toy, books, TV shows, video games and more.",Neutral
1205," The world loves Star Wars. I have little interest in all the extra films that Disney is grinding out. Too much too fast. Too much supply, not enough demand.",Neutral
1205," Well, I don't know what other generations want, but if they don't make money, Disney will stop.  Apparently Marcia Lucas mad several editing contributions to the original film that made quite a difference.",Neutral
1205," She had great story ideas. I think George has a lot of imagination, but he needs guidance, as we all do in creative endeavors. Nothing is done solo these days.",Neutral
1205,That is true.  God used over 40 authors for the 66 books of the Bible.  James Earl Jones only made $7.5 thousand for voicing Darth Vader.,Neutral
1205," He must have gotten residuals. If not, he made money on the next films. ",Neutral
1205,His voice is a gold mine.  Someone dubbed Star Wars in Navajo in 2013.  That was the first film dubbed into a Native American language.,Neutral
1205,I enjoyed chatting!,Happy
1205," Likewise.. I meant now, not "" not""  Likewise!",Neutral
1206,I love the Star Wars series - I remember seeing the first 3 as a child,Neutral
1206,Yes I love those movies too. Do you really think that Star Wars Episode 1 was about President Trump though? That seems far-fetched,Curious to dive deeper
1206,That does seem very far fetched.   I did not realize there were 9 total episodes!  No wonder it was the Guinness record holder for most successful film merchandising,Curious to dive deeper
1206,Yep you're right about that! What did you think about episode 1 though? I actually like it more than the newer movies like The Last Jedi which I think is horrible,Curious to dive deeper
1206,I did like episode 1 but only saw it once so I am a bit fuzzy about it.  I liked James Earl Jones in the original - rather funny he only got $7500 for recording his lines,Curious to dive deeper
1206," That is really crazy! You think you would have been paid a lot more, but that is a lot per hour, he only worked for about 2 and 1/2 hours",Surprised
1206,For sure.   I had no idea that the film had gotten redubbed into Navajo - that is an unusual choice!,Curious to dive deeper
1206," absolutely! what do you think about Marcia Lucas she doesn't get any credit in terms of star wars lore, but she made a lot of good editing decisions",Surprised
1206,Yes thank goodness George made a good choice in who to marry!   She even won the academy award for editing,Curious to dive deeper
1206,That's really awesome for exclamation mark did you hear how George Lucas became a billionaire by the way,Curious to dive deeper
1206,Yes the studio thought the movie would be a flop so they gave him merchandising rights!  He was smart!,Neutral
1206," He was really smart! Speaking of Star Wars and outer space, what do you think about the planet Earth?",Curious to dive deeper
1206,I am worried about it with global warming.  We could move to Venus but I think I would miss the change of seasons there,Neutral
1206," Yes I would miss the change of seasons, I would also not want to live on Uranus because it rotate sideways and rolls around LOL",Surprised
1206,That might make you dizzy!  Scientists have detected building blocks of life 455 light years away - I have no idea how they could detect that though!,Curious to dive deeper
1206," No I wondered about that too! Don't know if I would visit that, or if I would visit the planet that is raining glass they both sound dangerous LOL",Surprised
1206,Jupiter's moon would be big enough to be considered a planet if it orbited the sun.,Neutral
1206,That is interesting. Do you think they will ever have concerts in space? I know I went to a lot of concerts this year,Curious to dive deeper
1206,Bet you did not go to as many as linkin park played - they did 324 concerts in 2001,Surprised
1206," wow nope I didn't see them all, I have seen the ramones though, they did about 2200 concerts in 20 years which is insane",Surprised
1206,That is crazy.  At least they played good concerts - creed played one that was so bad that 4 people with tickets filed a lawsuit,Surprised
1206," lol I would be so embarrased, I just wish I could have seen that pink floyd concert back in 1972, they did a concert with no audience for some reason!",Surprised
1207,did you know that linkin park did over 300 concerts in 2001?,Surprised
1207,I did not. That's a shockingly high amount of concerts. Are you a fan of Lou Reed speaking of music?,Curious to dive deeper
1207," I can't say I know him, are you a fan of him? What band is he in?",Curious to dive deeper
1207,Velvet Underground. In 2010 he and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs. That's interesting.,Curious to dive deeper
1207," ah that is interesting, I wonder how the dogs liked it? Maybe they hated it how would you know!",Curious to dive deeper
1207,That's a very good question. I wonder what the owners say about how they reacted. Are you aware of ABBA?,Curious to dive deeper
1207," yes I do know about ABBA, I like them, what do you think about them?",Neutral
1207,Not a big fan but they have some catchy songs. They turned down 1 billion dollars to do a 100 concert reunion tour. I wonder how they still have so much money that they could do that?,Curious to dive deeper
1207," ya that is true, I do like Pink Floyd a lot, what about you? I guess they did a concert in an ancient roman amphitheater",Happy
1207,I love Pink Floyd. I bet that was an amazing concert. In 1972 Deep Purple held the loudest concert ever and three audience members became unconscious. With all of the extremely heacy metal since I am shocked that Deep Purple holds that record.,Surprised
1207," ah yes I do like Deep Purple too, I guess when Pink Floyd did that concert they did it to an empty area, there was no audience in the amphitheater",Happy
1207,That's a shame. I'm sure it would have been used. I wonder if they recorded and released it?,Curious to dive deeper
1207," ya I would love to see that, do you like the Ramones?",Curious to dive deeper
1207,I do like The Ramones.,Happy
1207," well the ramones have performed over 2200 concerts, isn't that insane? They've been touring for 20 years now",Surprised
1207,Wow! That is shocking. I had no idea they toured that long. I don't think there's many left now unfortunately. I like the Foo Fighters also. They held a concert so loud that it showed up on seismic monitors.,Surprised
1207," haha that is crazy, also I don't like Creed what about you? apparently they did a concert that was so bad they were sued lol",Surprised
1207,I do not like them at all. I can't say I'm surprised. I don't know who their fan base is because I don't know anyone that likes them. Do you enjoy Star Wars?,Curious to dive deeper
1207," I do like star wars, but I like the old ones, the new ones are pretty horrible in my opinion",Curious to dive deeper
1207,Well it had a lot of influence. James Cameron quit his truck driving job to make movies after seeing it.,Neutral
1207," that is great I love James Cameron, he directed Terminator, Terminator 2, true lies, so many great movies!",Curious to dive deeper
1207,Yes and Aliens which I love. He is great. George Lucas says that the Star Wars story we are seeing is told by R2D2 about a 100 years after Return of the Jedi.,Happy
1207," well that is interesting, I think its crazy that darth vader is so iconic but all his lines were recorded for the first movie in about 3 hours",Surprised
1207,I guess he doesn't have a lot of dialogue overall. I wish the revealed man would have also been James Earl Jones.,Curious to dive deeper
1208,I don't understand why everyone is interested in Paul Manafort.  Do you?,Neutral
1208,I guess people want to find out about all the money he sent to the Ukraine and he apparently has an interesting wardrobe consisting of pythons and other reptiles,Neutral
1208," Well, I suppose americans do have an over-interest in fashion.  Even real fashion is outlandish, like anything at a paris fashion show.",Disgusted
1208," Yea, I understand how certain outfits convey a message but I'd never spend $1 million on a suit like Manafort, no matter how confident it might make me look",Neutral
1208," At that point, with so much money spent on clothes, I'd suspect money laundering.  Did he buy a nice suit with something really special in all the pockets?  It's shady.",Disgusted
1208," Yea, I guess when you're on trail for money laundering maybe it's best not to wear extravagant suits, Paul Manafort already looks like a shady guy no outfit will change that",Neutral
1208,Is he really on trial for money laundering?  That was a guess on my part.  Do you know?,Surprised
1208," I'm not exactly sure, it's a bunch of stuff similar to that and not reporting income or registering as a lobbyist for a foreign agent",Neutral
1208," How does someone get into that line of work?  Old family connections?  It's a part of life I think most people don't know about.  If it were more widely known, maybe he'd just be seen as quirky and not shady.  What do you think?",Curious to dive deeper
1208,Probably a rich guy who wanted to get richer and wanted to get money from people in other countries so he could buy some ostrich jackets,Neutral
1208," Ah, it's really the jackets that drive the model.  Where are the Ostrich preservation lobbyists when you need them?   Do you wear fancy clothes ever?",Curious to dive deeper
1208," Not really except for special occasions, but I would like to buy Miguel Cabarello's bulletproof clothing",Neutral
1208," What kind of clothing is that?  It's not tactical police-wear, is it?",Curious to dive deeper
1208," Probably, I'd imagine it's for rich people and/or bodyguards. If Miguel Cabarello is from Mexico I'd imaging bulletproof clothing would be in high demand there",Neutral
1208," Sadly, yes.  I'm scared to drive through Mexico City, where the police corruption is really bad.  With that in mind, it's hard to think of USA cops as rotten.",Sad
1208,That sucks. I guess bulletproof clothing would do more good there than asbestos clothing that the greeks use to make,Neutral
1208," Asbestos?  And they didn't just die from it?  Reminds me of mercury used in fancy hats a la ""Mad Hatter"".  Do we wear hazardous things today?  Will we find out in a few decades?",Fearful
1208," I bet the greeks who did wear the Asbestos clothing eventually go sick, I think it takes a long time of exposure before cancer develops later in life",Neutral
1208," A slow kill.  Well, we do care more about radioactivity and such.  And our research labs are better at finding links like that.  If only they could better detect corruption of government officials.",Sad
1208," Yea that be nice, end all the shutdowns. There has already been 17 over 37 years, pretty ridiculous  ",Neutral
1208," Well, I wonder what an acceptable number would be.  Like, what is it for other countries?  Maybe 17 is low for four decades.",Curious to dive deeper
1208," I'd like to think 0, the government should be able to compromise and avoid that stuff, at least there hasn't been 3 shutdowns in one year since 1977",Disgusted
1208," Yes, that's good.  Compromise is hard to come by these days.  I think allowing for earmarks would solve the gridlock.  What do you think?",Curious to dive deeper
1208,I think republicans should ignore Trump and work with the Democrats on a reasonable compromise,Neutral
1208," I'd be interested in reading more about some proposals.  I think border security is important, but without having even a proposal, it's hard to talk about.  What do you think would be reasonable?",Curious to dive deeper
1208," Give money for border security but not 5.7 billion for a wall, there's better things that money could be spent on and Trump said he would get Mexico to pay for it anyway",Neutral
1208," 5.7 billion is a lot of money, but not when you compare it to how much the federal government takes in and spends.  We're probably spending 5 billion on less important things too.",Disgusted
1208," I'd really like to see money invested on improving roads and other infrastructure. I got to go, it was nice talking with you.",Neutral
1209," Hello, do you have a favorite piece of clothing?",Curious to dive deeper
1209,I love everything in color I think and you?,Curious to dive deeper
1209," Yeah me too, like the pigrims. they only wore black in special occasions ",Curious to dive deeper
1209," Yeah I like their approach, colorful clothes for a happier life",Curious to dive deeper
1209," True, I agree. Do you know how fashion people can tell if you need your clothes tailored?",Curious to dive deeper
1209," Yes they look for collar gaps in them, pretty cool trick",Curious to dive deeper
1209,Yeah. IN Alabama a store sells stuff that is left at airports unclaimed,Curious to dive deeper
1209," I wonder what they have in there, must be a store with everything possible",Curious to dive deeper
1209,Exactly. Apple even had a clothing line,Curious to dive deeper
1209," Yeah that was back in 1986, I wonder what happened to it though",Curious to dive deeper
1209,Yeah me too. Do you know much about Oscar Wilde?,Curious to dive deeper
1209,I know that Olivia Wilde adopted the last name in his honor.,Curious to dive deeper
1209,Yeah. DO you know what he said when asked if he has anything to declare at US customs?,Curious to dive deeper
1209," Yup, he said, nothing to declare but my genius. he was a genius alright",Curious to dive deeper
1209,Yup pretty much. Do you know what his last words were?,Curious to dive deeper
1209,SOmething about him fighting with the wallpaper and how one has to go,Curious to dive deeper
1209,Yeah. There are people who go to his tombstone and kiss it with lipstick on,Curious to dive deeper
1209," Yeah and it is pretty hefty, $12000 is a lot of money for 2 seconds",Curious to dive deeper
1209,It sure is. DO you know much about the government?,Curious to dive deeper
1209,I know some stuff. DO you know what wikileaks is?,Curious to dive deeper
1209,Yeah that is the website that published secret documents from the government,Happy
1210," Did you know that pilgrim clothing was actually full color, and they only wore black for special occasions?",Curious to dive deeper
1210,I did not know that. Please tell me more.   I just read about Paul Manafort and his leather clothing.,Curious to dive deeper
1210,It is rather new information to me about the pilgrims.  I guess I always had the notions that were put in my head in elementary history classes that always showed black and white clothes.  What is this about Manafort?  was he the one who wore a bunch of different reptiles?,Curious to dive deeper
1210,Yes.  He is in jail now.  He used to work for Trump.  He was known for wearing all kinds of leather jackets.  He spent over a million dollars on his jackets.,Disgusted
1210," That is crazy, Im not much into fashion myself, so I couldnt ever see function in spending that much on clothes",Neutral
1210,I agree with you.  The article writer said that people like Manafort look like they came from a time machine from 1980 and tried to blend in with people.,Curious to dive deeper
1210," Maybe they all shopped at this one store in Alabama that only sells clothes, cameras and items found in unclaimed baggage.    ",Neutral
1210,How did the shop owner get the items from unclaimed baggage?,Curious to dive deeper
1210," I don't know, I think after a certain number of days they might auction it off, kind of like the same principle as storage units on storage wars and stuff.",Neutral
1210,You are probably right.  Do you know that each government has a kind of constitution?,Curious to dive deeper
1210," I guess I never thought about it, but I guess you're right.  In order to maintain some order they would need something to rely on.",Neutral
1210," Apparently, Monaco people do not have to pay income tax.",Curious to dive deeper
1210," That would be nice, I wonder if they have something in its place.",Curious to dive deeper
1210,The government has enough revenue from casino operations.,Neutral
1210," Wow.  I wish we had something like that here.  But we do have the government that tries to destroy wiki leaks, but wikileaks finds out and publishes the plans...",Curious to dive deeper
1210," I did not know about it.  I do not care much about wiki and the founder.  It is okay to leak documents but they are somewhat biased (my opinion only).  Anyway, do you know that the US government has 17 shutdowns in the last 37 years?",Disgusted
1210," No, I guess this last one seemed to be one of the longest, or at least most controversial that I have remembered. ",Neutral
1210," Also, we all know that the Chinese government censor all kinds of publications.  Ironically, they also banned the word ""censorship"".",Curious to dive deeper
1210," It is kind of crazy that they would, and could ban a word.  That leads to scary things",Neutral
1210,I agree with you.  I wonder if the US government will do another shutdown in a couple of weeks (no. 18 in history)?,Curious to dive deeper
1210," You never know, things seem to be unstable at time.  But there was a man in France who impersonated a government official and sold the Eiffel Tower twice, so crazy things can happen",Curious to dive deeper
1210," That was amazing.  I wonder if it really happened or it was fake news.  Anyway, I've got to run. Nice chatting with you!",Happy
1211,Do you like to dance?,Curious to dive deeper
1211," Sometimes, although I'm no good. You?",Curious to dive deeper
1211," I like to dance, one of the best dancers was Bruce Lee, the martial artist.",Curious to dive deeper
1211,Yeah I had heard he was a great dancer. He won a championship once or something.,Surprised
1211," He did, it was a cha-cha championship and that happened in the year 1958, a long time ago",Curious to dive deeper
1211,Have you heard of the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater?,Curious to dive deeper
1211," No, havent heard of that theater, is it nice?",Curious to dive deeper
1211,They perform at the Kennedy Center in DC. They had a really great performance recently.,Happy
1211," Oh now I remember, its a nice theatre it just has like this positive vive of spiritual righteousness, nice venue for an event",Curious to dive deeper
1211,It was quite transcendent. We all have the innate desire to dance. Babies do it instinctively.,Happy
1211," That is funny, how babies  just start dancing to the music, they seem to love music and love dancing, they are just so cute",Happy
1211,Tupac danced ballet in high school. Which is crazy and cool at the same time.,Surprised
1211," He did? wow, didnt viewed him as a dancer at all, he must had spent a fortune on shoes",Curious to dive deeper
1211," Yeah, professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shoes in a week. Those are a lot more expensive than the guitar strings I have to replace monthly on my guitars.",Surprised
1211," Thats a lot of shoes for only one week lol, and they must be, maybe they get a big discount for buying a lot of them at once",Curious to dive deeper
1211,Probably just get a huge box shipped out once a month when they buy in bulk.,Happy
1211," Yeah could be, so do you like birds? I find them really interesting",Curious to dive deeper
1211,They are cool. Their skeletons weigh less than the feathers.,Neutral
1211,I guess thats why many of them can fly easily did you hear about birds in Australia? they sure have identity issues lol,Curious to dive deeper
1211," THey mimic everything! Yeah, pick a sound and stick with it!",Happy
1211," Yeah lol, I think thats really funny, anyway its been fun chatting with you, nice conversation, nice facts have a nice one",Curious to dive deeper
1212,Dance is an art of selected sequences of human movement.,Happy
1212,How true! How are you doing this morning?,Curious to dive deeper
1212," Yes, make the flow of blood fast in the body. What about you ?",Curious to dive deeper
1212," I'm good, thanks for asking.  Yes, dance does make the blood flow fast in the body, for sure.  Do you like dancing?",Curious to dive deeper
1212,Yes. Different culture have different type of dancing to represent the ancient culture.,Curious to dive deeper
1212," Yes, they do.  I was fascinated to find out that Bruce Lee was a great dancer and was the Hong Kong Cha Cha championship winner in 1958!",Surprised
1212,Michael jackson has a patent on a device used to become extreme lean in some of his dance moves.,Curious to dive deeper
1212,I figured as much.  He was such an innovator in the field of dance.  It doesn't surprise me that he has a patent.,Happy
1212,Some steps are very difficulty he performs very well. Amazing performer.,Curious to dive deeper
1212,Did you know that Tupac Shakur danced ballet in High school?,Curious to dive deeper
1212,Yes. some birds fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping when migrating.,Happy
1212,That's cool to know. Most birds have bones that are so hollow their entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers.  Did you know that?,Curious to dive deeper
1212," The digestive and respiratory systems of birds specially designed for flying purpose. Some bird species live in aquatic environment, they can swimming for their food.",Curious to dive deeper
1212,How very interesting.,Surprised
1212,Penguins is belong to birds species they are living mainly in arctic sea they are living in extremely cold area.,Curious to dive deeper
1212," Again, how very interesting.",Curious to dive deeper
1212,The biggest bird is 9ft ostrich. do you know ?,Curious to dive deeper
1212," Actually, I did not know that fact.  I did know that the extinct Dodo bird is actually a sub family of the pigeon.  Did you know that?",Curious to dive deeper
1212,The elephant birds do not have wings.,Happy
1212," Cool, you must really be into birds.  That seems to be all you talk about!",Surprised
1212,Yes. Hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct their nests.,Happy
1212," Again, how very interesting!",Surprised
1212,Jazz is the music originated in US,Happy
1212," That's nice.  Been good chatting with you this morning, I need to head off to work, now.  ",Happy
1213,Hi!  Do you follow politics?,Neutral
1213," Hello. Yes I try to stay informed, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1213," I too, try to keep myself in the know.  Did you know 86% of Nevada is owned by the government?",Neutral
1213," No I didn't know that. I wonder why. But between the nuclear tests they use to do there, and area 51 maybe that's why.",Curious to dive deeper
1213," That is what I was thinking.  Did you hear about they guy in France, and the Eiffel Tower?",Curious to dive deeper
1213,Yeah I heard he sold it not just once but twice. He must be a pretty good con man. He sounds like my brother in law.,Happy
1213,Ha!  You gotta be to pull that stunt off twice.,Neutral
1213,I guess. How about when Nixon broke the senate gavel that had been used for 165 years?,Curious to dive deeper
1213,He must have felt so bad about that.  No candy from that candy desk for him!,Neutral
1213,Yup no candy for him. They probably have to give out candy because that's the only way they can get some senators to show up.,Happy
1213,LOL  so very true.  It is like bribing kids.,Neutral
1213,Exactly. They act like kids so we have to treat them like kids.,Happy
1213,Not letting women wear pants is definitely a little kid move.,Neutral
1213,Yes it is. Although for a long time that was accepted in this country. Did you the first woman to wear pants on prime time TV  was Mary Tyler Moore?,Curious to dive deeper
1213,I didnt know that.  Way to go for her!  I am glad she had the courage to defy stereotypes,Neutral
1213,She was a remarkable woman. In fact when I went to high school the girls were never able to wear pants. Whoops I think I'm giving away my age.,Neutral
1213,Lol.  I am a woman and I love my pants.  Couldnt imagine it another way,Neutral
1213,I can understand. I also like both.,Happy
1213,Did you hear Jordan's response about why he wouldnt endorse a Democratic Candidate,Curious to dive deeper
1213," No, what was it?",Curious to dive deeper
1213,He said republicans buy shoes too.  Nice chat!  Have a great day!,Neutral
1214," Hello,  did you know that a man in france imperonated a gov official and sold the eiffel tower  twice!",Curious to dive deeper
1214," Yes, I've heard that one!  And speaking of governments, did you know that the US government publishes the full names of anybody who chooses to renounce their citizenship?",Curious to dive deeper
1214,that is interesting.  I did not know that.  I hear that 86% of Nevada is owned by the government though!,Curious to dive deeper
1214,That is interesting. Did you also realize that JP Morgan bailed out the US government back in 1895?,Curious to dive deeper
1214,lol that is weird.  The government must have been in pretty deep.,Curious to dive deeper
1214,Not only that but the US government has actually shut down 17 times over the past 37 years. It happened 3 times in 1977.,Curious to dive deeper
1214,Wow interesting.  I hear the us senate used the same gavel for 165 years!!!  That is really long!,Curious to dive deeper
1214," True. In another government, like Monaco, they eliminated income tax back in 1869 because the revenue from the casino was sufficient to sustain their government.",Curious to dive deeper
1214,Wow.  Did you know Wikileaks published the governments plan to distroy Wikileaks?  lol thats hilarious.,Curious to dive deeper
1214," I thought so too. Another funny one is that Michael Jordan was once asked why he wouldn't endorse black democratic candidate Harvey Gantt in a North Carolina senate race, to which Michael Jordan responded, ""Republicans buy shoes too"".",Curious to dive deeper
1214,lol.  Did you know women were not allowed to wear pants unitil 1993?,Curious to dive deeper
1214,That's a funny one. Where couldn't they wear pants?,Curious to dive deeper
1214," I forgot to put,  they couldnt wear pants in the us senate.  Sorry that must have been confusing.  I dont know why they couldnt actually,  just a fun fact I recently read. ",Curious to dive deeper
1214," That's ok.  Talking about clothes, did you know that the T-shirt was invented in 1904 and marketed to bachelors who couldn't sew or replace their buttons?",Curious to dive deeper
1214,Thats cool!  I found out the Lacoste shirts all the polo riders wear was originally made for tennis players lol,Curious to dive deeper
1214," Yes, and Calvin and Hobbes window decals and T-shirts as well as most other memorabilia are all copyright violations. Gee.",Curious to dive deeper
1214,Oh I see.  Did you know the official business attire in Hawaii is the aloha shirt?,Curious to dive deeper
1214," Yes, that's kind of intuitive, actually.  Did you know that plain grey shirt that Mark Zuckeberg wears all the time costs between $300 and $400?",Curious to dive deeper
1214,Thats crazy lol That is so much money for a plain grey shirt!,Curious to dive deeper
1214," That's what I thought, too.  Did you know that at Billy May's funeral the pallbearer wore blue shirts and khaki pants?",Curious to dive deeper
1214," No never knew that lol Its been great chatting,  gotta run. ",Curious to dive deeper
1215," Hello there, are you a fan of jazz music?",Curious to dive deeper
1215," Like some jazz. Find Coltrane a bit hard to listen to for long, but enjoyed the Alvin Ailey dance company's portrayal of his jazz in movement to be inspiring.",Neutral
1215," It is a bit hard to listen to very long, unless you are really into jazz in my opinion.  I do enjoy some myself.",Curious to dive deeper
1215," Agreed. Dance, for me, isn't hard to watch for very long. Have always loved broadcasts of Ailey's dancers, Twyla Tharp's company years ago, and the NY City Ballet. What athletes and magicians dancers can be. But the companies can also be tough places to earn a fair living.",Curious to dive deeper
1215," That is very true, I think it requires just as much skill and training as any professional sport. ",Curious to dive deeper
1215," I'm sure you're right. Artists are not often, by nature, ""tough"" negotiators, but things are changing. Dance companies, like orchestras today, have unions, stage boycotts, and threaten strikes.",Curious to dive deeper
1215,That is true as well.  Did you know that Tupac used to dance ballet in high school?,Curious to dive deeper
1215," I can see him, portraying the Mouse King in the Nutcracker. Bet he enjoyed a villain role, since they're usually deliciously villainous!",Curious to dive deeper
1215,I bet he did!  That would be fun to see an old video of him performing that role.,Curious to dive deeper
1215," Agreed. I'd also like to see the late Bruce Lee, who was a great dancer. So many activities, from martial arts to figure skating to marching bands can include dance-like movements or qualities. Athletics, of course, also inspires sometimes like dance movement.",Neutral
1215," I bet he was an excellent dancer, he could move around effortlessly it seemed.  And I agree, all types of athletics. ",Curious to dive deeper
1215," Take Tom Brady, Patriots long-time QB for example. Sometimes when he makes an accurate throw, his movement syncs with the ball, which flies magically right to a receiver, and the receiver's leap is just like a dance movement. ",Happy
1215,That is an excellent example!  Did you know that ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shoes in a single week!?,Curious to dive deeper
1215," Heard that, and I believe it. Think that refers to classical ballet dancers, not necessarily modern dance. Alvin Ailey pioneered modern dance, and he understood that audiences want to see more athleticism, like they'd see on a field, court or in a stadium.",Curious to dive deeper
1215,I think you are right about that.  It just shows you how much wear and tear that has on those feet.,Curious to dive deeper
1215," Feet that bleed a lot, like those of gymnasts and countless other athletes. I admire the courage it takes to endure, in the arts or in athletics. Did you know that the 88 year old actor and director, Clint Eastwood, is a lifelong fan of jazz - and he plays piano, and even created the score for his Oscar-winning film, Million Dollar Baby. Who knew?",Curious to dive deeper
1215," That is impressive, he is a very talented person, I can't believe he still kicks so much butt at his age. ",Curious to dive deeper
1215,Must be in the genes. Maybe athletes and other performers have just a bit of bird DNA still kicking around their gene pool. Avian magic. Who knows?,Curious to dive deeper
1215," Oh I think genes plays a huge role in that.  In anything really, those that really make it, usually have a relative that was into the same type of thing. ",Curious to dive deeper
1215," True. Did you know that the vast majority of bird species are monogamous, some just for one breeding season, others for years or even for life. From penguins to cardinals...",Curious to dive deeper
1215," No I didn't know that, but very interesting.  Well it's been nice chatting, I hope you have a nice day!",Happy
1216,How are you? Are you a big literature fan? The word literature is latin,Curious to dive deeper
1216,not really... never been a big fan of reading!  You ever been to a book club?,Happy
1216,No but I have read On Moral Fiction a long time ago,Neutral
1216,i wonder what year the fda burned six tons of books?,Curious to dive deeper
1216,Must of been in the 60's or earlier if it was over censorship,Neutral
1216,yeah... kind of figured that!,Curious to dive deeper
1216," I never knew Churchill won a nobel prize in literature, I wonder what he wrote",Surprised
1216,i have no clue! That's funny about romantic kissing being fairly recent,Happy
1216,People probably thought it was taboo but I'm surprised the ancient greeks or romans didn't feature it,Surprised
1216,yeah... was probably to risque!  Do you have a dog?,Curious to dive deeper
1216," Yea, a jack terrier that does not resemble a wolf at all lol",Happy
1216,LOL... so true!  i wonder why dogs have so many different types of blood types,Curious to dive deeper
1216," Me too,12 is a lot, I think humans have 4 blood types only",Surprised
1216,i wanna work for Google just because they are a dog company!,Curious to dive deeper
1216,I'd like to work in Istanbul to see the vending machine that gives stray dogs food and water,Neutral
1216,LOL... that's crazy!  What's even crazier is people do a fantasy draft for the national spelling bee,Curious to dive deeper
1216,I don't know if that is more crazy or if it's the fantasy congress,Neutral
1216,gotta love that brain of ours... a single fold is the difference between fantasy and reality,Curious to dive deeper
1216,The Janitor who wrote a 145 page manuscript must've had a big fold,Neutral
1216,yeah right!  Do you like fantasy?,Curious to dive deeper
1216," I did when I was younger, I read a Terry Pratchett book",Neutral
1216,don't know who that is?,Curious to dive deeper
1216,Some guy who was knighted. I gtg but it was nice talking to you,Neutral
1217,Hello! Do you like dogs?,Curious to dive deeper
1217," Hello, to you as well.  Yes, I love dogs.  Do you?",Curious to dive deeper
1217,I do.  I have one.  Did you know that dogs aren't colorblind?  They just can't see as many different colors as humans.,Happy
1217," You know, I always wondered if my dogs could see color or not.  ",Happy
1217,Now you know.  lol  Dogs and elephants are the only animals that seem to instinctively understand pointing.  There's another fact for you.  lol,Happy
1217,I know for a fact my dogs understand pointing.  They're both so smart!,Happy
1217," Yes.  Speaking of cats, Google prefers dogs to cats as stated in their code of conduct that states they are a dog company.",Happy
1217,Stellar point!  Always figured Google was pro dog!,Happy
1217,lol  I was surprised to have recently found out there is 12 different blood types for dogs and that dogs can donate blood at dog blood drives.  Who would have known?,Happy
1217," I've never heard of dogs donating blood, that's so fascinating to me.  I also didn't know they have 12 different blood types.  I do know they are wonderful creatures and are truly man's best friend.",Surprised
1217,Yes they are.  In Istanbul they have a vending machine that releases food and water for the city's stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles.,Happy
1217," How cool, that seems like a nice program, kills two birds with one stone.",Surprised
1217,Yes.  I agree.  It would be nice to see something like that here in the states.  Are you a fan of literature?,Curious to dive deeper
1217," Yes, I am.  Are you a fan?",Curious to dive deeper
1217,Somewhat.  It was an Olympic event from 1912-1952.  I don't know how you turn that into a sport?  lol,Happy
1217,Me either?  That's so strange.,Surprised
1217,I wouldn't want to be a judge.  lol  In 1953 Sir Winston Churchill won a nobel prize for literature.  Never knew that.,Happy
1217," Me either, I would have thought it would have been for peace.",Surprised
1217,Yes.  Me too.  I would like to see the annual contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel. lol  That would be funny.,Happy
1217," Yes, it would!",Happy
1217,I have to get going nice chatting!,Happy
1218,do you go to concerts?,Curious to dive deeper
1218,sometimes. Did you know Linkin Park has 324 concerts in 2001,Curious to dive deeper
1218,Yes that was because their debut album was really successful,Curious to dive deeper
1218,Yeah. Ad the Ramon toured for 20 years in a row,Curious to dive deeper
1218," That was crazy, they played 2263 concerts in that time",Curious to dive deeper
1218,Yeah. In Croatia there is an ancient theatre and they have concerts there,Curious to dive deeper
1218,Same as in Italy where Pink Floys once held a live concert,Curious to dive deeper
1218,TOo bad there was no audience there to listen to them,Curious to dive deeper
1218," Yeah I wonder what all that was about, no audience",Curious to dive deeper
1218," No idea. Creed once held a concert that was so bad, people sued them",Curious to dive deeper
1218,Yeah. Do you know much about politics?,Curious to dive deeper
1218,I know some stuff like the president has either been a republican or a democrat since 1853,Curious to dive deeper
1218," True, we never hear of any other parties to be honest",Curious to dive deeper
1218,Yeah and republican ones have always had a beard,Curious to dive deeper
1218,Interesting.Do you know when both parties started using the red and blue colors?,Curious to dive deeper
1218,that was actually a pretty recent thing in the 2000s,Curious to dive deeper
1218,Yeah. Did you know truman refused to have a photo taken on the dumbo ride?,Curious to dive deeper
1218,Yes because he did not want to be associated with the republicans in any way,Curious to dive deeper
1218,Yeah. 15% of the tea party seems to identify as a democrat,Curious to dive deeper
1218,That is a fair share. Did you hear of Fox trying to sue the SImpsons?,Curious to dive deeper
1218,Yes because they parodies their anti-democratc party agenda. Nice chatting with you.,Happy
1219,Hey there what's the best concert you've ever been to?,Curious to dive deeper
1219," Hello! I loved Linkin Prk, even though I haven't seen them since 2001.",Happy
1219,Yes Lincoln Park is great. They actually did about 320 concerts in a year which is awesome,Surprised
1219,That was 2001. It was crazy. Not as crazy as the Ramones schedule.,Surprised
1219,Yep they did 2200 concerts in a span of 20 years that's insane,Surprised
1219," That sure is, they couldn't have had much of a personal life. Pink Floyd recorded a live concert at the amphitheater in Pompeii, that would have been awesome to hear.",Surprised
1219," Yep I love Pink Floyd, it's crazy they did that back in 1972 to a completely missing audience LOL I hope that they video recorded it",Surprised
1219," I don't know if they did or not. At least they didn't have any fans suing them for a bad concert, like Creed.",Curious to dive deeper
1219,No I would feel horrible if I were sued because my concert was so bad LOL that's funny that happened in 2002,Surprised
1219," well, It IS Creed lol. Did you know that every president who has had a beard, is a Republican?",Curious to dive deeper
1219,No I didn't know that that is interesting though. It's interesting too that there hasn't been a president hasn't been either a Republican or a Democrat since about the year 1853,Curious to dive deeper
1219,The use of red and blue for the parties didn't start until 2000. I thought it was around longer than that.,Surprised
1219," Did you know Harry Truman wouldn't get his picture taken with Dumbo, because Dumbo is an elephant which represents the Republican party?",Sad
1219,Who can go to Disney and not get their photo taken? That's as crazy as Fox news wanting to sue the Simpsons.,Curious to dive deeper
1219,What seems weird to me too is that 15% of the tea party claims to be Democrats. That doesn't seem to add up.,Surprised
1219," I don't think so either. It's weird that up until trump, there hasn't been a republican elected, that wasn't named Bush or Nixon.",Surprised
1219,That is strange. Also strange that Ronald Reagan used to be a Democrat and what campaign for their causes such as corporate profits and low wages,Surprised
1219,Sounds like trump and Reagan have a lot in common with that then. I didn't know Teddy Roosevelt was a third party candidate.,Curious to dive deeper
1219,Yes he ran for the Bull Moose Party. It's interesting that he did that back in 1912,Surprised
1219,Maybe we need another third-party candidate. I do wonder if FDR's New Deal would be passed today.,Curious to dive deeper
1219,Yaks politics today is really weird so I wouldn't hold my breath haha.,Happy
1220,I wonder if that janitor's fantasy novel was any good.,Curious to dive deeper
1220," I'm not sure which novel you mean. I don't read a lot of fantasy, do you?",Curious to dive deeper
1220,I'm more into sci-fi. But supposedly a janitor in Chicago left a 15000 pp manuscript that was found after he died.,Neutral
1220," Wow, that's pretty neat! I wonder what it was about? ",Surprised
1220," Same. Guess I'll do some Googling. I've read some fantasy that I liked -- Wind in the Willows, Narnia... What do you like to read?",Curious to dive deeper
1220,I don't get much time to read a lot these days. Did you know the FDA burned 6 tons of books once in order to censor them?,Curious to dive deeper
1220,I wonder what they were about.,Curious to dive deeper
1220,I'm not sure. I know literature was an olympic event until the 1950's!,Curious to dive deeper
1220,I really have trouble wrapping my head around that. Especially considering some of the stuff that's rejected as an olympic sport.,Surprised
1220," Yeah, it's pretty strange to think about. Music and painting were also events!",Surprised
1220,I'm surprised that dogs aren't descended from the species of wolves that are around today. I wonder what the dog's ancestors looked like.,Curious to dive deeper
1220,I'm not sure. Dogs were the first animals to be domesticated.,Surprised
1220,Yeah. And interacting with them probably helped shape our society too. I like cats because they're mostly unchanged from their wild ancestors -- a lot less than dogs.,Happy
1220," Yeah, with all the selective breeding, who knows how alike dogs are to their ancestors",Curious to dive deeper
1220,At least they can still cross-breed with wolves.,Neutral
1220,True. There are dog blood drives where dogs can donate blood to eachother. That's pretty neat.,Surprised
1220,It must really make things complicated having to store that many blood types.,Neutral
1220," Yeah, I think there are 12 different ones!",Surprised
1220,Must be really traumatic for a dog to donate blood.,Curious to dive deeper
1220,I'm not sure how that works. Dogs are super smart. They are one of the only animals that understands pointing.,Surprised
1220,Nice talking to you!,Happy
1221,Hello - how are you doing today?,Happy
1221,I am good. Are you more of a cat or dog person?,Curious to dive deeper
1221,I am definitely more of a dog person. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
1221,I like both but I guess I am more of a dog person. Google is a dog company and they prefer dogs as well.,Neutral
1221,That's funny they are a dog company. Did you know there are 12 different blood types that a dog can have?,Surprised
1221,I never knew that. Or that they have dog blood drives. How surprising!,Surprised
1221,That's funny. Istanbul has vending machines that dispense food and water for the stray dogs in exchange for plastic bottles.,Surprised
1221," If America had that, I would definitely use it. And I would point to the machine and the dog would know, an elephant too, I suppose.",Happy
1221,It's a very good way to recycle plastic bottles. I don't think we have a stray dog problem though.,Happy
1221," No, thank goodness. Did you know dogs are not color blind? I always thought they were",Curious to dive deeper
1221," Hmm...I did not know that. Looks like they can't see all of the colors a human can, but they can see most of them which is interesting.",Surprised
1221,I wonder which colors they can and cannot see. I wonder if it helps them with any of the jobs they perform. Do you know of any dog tasks or jobs?,Curious to dive deeper
1221,Yea I'm not too sure on what colors they can and can not see. No idea on any dog tasks or jobs.,Curious to dive deeper
1221," I  know that they can help with hunting, herding, protection, policing, companionship and I even personally know of dogs who help children with reading",Surprised
1221," Yea they can do all sorts of good things to help out humans. Switching gears, did you know people fantasy draft the national spelling bee.",Surprised
1221,How interesting. I would not even know how to begin my team. I know of fantasy sport teams but not spelling bee. I learned there is even a fantasy congress!,Surprised
1221," Haha - I do play fantasy football, but that's about it. ",Surprised
1221,And it just a single fold in the brain that separates your fantasy team from the real team. Pretty interesting.,Surprised
1221,That's really interesting.,Surprised
1221," Well thanks for chatting today, I learned a lot of new and interesting things.",Neutral
1221,Same to you!,Happy
1222," hi, do you attend concerts?",Curious to dive deeper
1222," hi I do, I went to Lollapalooze last year, it was in Chicago, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1222," nice, yeah me too I like them a lot. do you know linkin park?",Curious to dive deeper
1222," I have heard of them, I haven't seen their concert though, you?",Curious to dive deeper
1222," They have held many concerts, 324 in 2011 alone",Curious to dive deeper
1222," wow that is impressive, also impressive Abba turned down a 100 concert tour, even though they'd be paid over a billion dollars!",Surprised
1222,wowww that is a lot. do you know the ramones?,Curious to dive deeper
1222," I have heard of them yes, I don't really like them but I know they play a lot of concerts right?",Curious to dive deeper
1222,yeah they do. they played for 20 years straight,Curious to dive deeper
1222," ya that is insane, do you like Dave Matthews band?  I guess a woman helped a random cyclist who turned out to be the man himself!",Surprised
1222,That is a big coincidence for sure. did you know there is an ancient thatre in crotia that is still used as a concert venue?,Curious to dive deeper
1222,do you like Foo Fighters? I guess when they played in New Zealand their show showed up on the earthquake monitors,Surprised
1222,that is mind blowing. and creed held a concert and it was so bad people sued them,Curious to dive deeper
1222," haha I would be so embarrassed to be sued for that actually, did you know the Republican party started back in 1854?",Surprised
1222,yeah they have been around for so long. along with the democrats. do you know why it is called GOP?,Curious to dive deeper
1222,I think it's Grand Old Party? Did you hear about the Bull Moose Party? It was made by a Teddy Roosevelt and other progressive Republicans,Happy
1222,no I have not heard about that. Did you know all presidents have been either republicans or democrats since 1853?,Curious to dive deeper
1222," I did hear about that, also that Hillary Clinton was a republican in college, weird!",Surprised
1222," I know and now she goes against them, go figure. did you know every republican president has had a beard?",Curious to dive deeper
1222,no I didn't know that.,Happy
1222,hahahhha. nice chat,Happy
1223,What do you think about the gun control laws that Maryland added.,Curious to dive deeper
1223,Hello there.  I think they are trying anything they can to stop all of the recent shootings.  How about yourself?,Curious to dive deeper
1223," I think there must be some control so I do agree with them, guns can be really dangerous in the wrong hands.",Curious to dive deeper
1223," Yeah I agree as well, I don't see the use for some of the guns you are able to buy these days. ",Curious to dive deeper
1223,Shootings are really sad and they can really traumatize a family. I still remember the Parkland High School shooting; 17 dead. That was sad.,Sad
1223," Yeah that was super sad, it's sad to think of all of the people that impacted but most of all for those that passed. ",Curious to dive deeper
1223," I agree and also that shooting in Las Vegas, that was also really sad and filled with hate.",Curious to dive deeper
1223," Yeah that was so sad, people just there attending a concert trying to have fun.  Do you attend many concerts?",Curious to dive deeper
1223," I used to like them. I went to this awesome Linkin Park concert back in 2001, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1223," Yeah I used to go more often, but I would like to start going again.  Do you know the band the Ramones have played over 2,000 shows?",Curious to dive deeper
1223," What wasa the last concert you attended? and wow 2000 shows is a lot, that must have been depleting.",Curious to dive deeper
1223," Yeah that is a crazy amount of shows.  I think the last concert I went to was Ty Segall in Madison, WI. ",Curious to dive deeper
1223," I see, was it good? In 1972 Pink Floyd recorded a concert without people, in a Roman amphitheater.",Curious to dive deeper
1223," Yeah it was really good, the whole band was super nice as well.  And yeah I think I have seen some video footage of that, very cool. ",Curious to dive deeper
1223," Sounds like you had a lot of fun, Creed on the other hand had a terrible presentation on their 2002 concert, people were pissed.",Curious to dive deeper
1223,Yeah I heard that people filed a lawsuit because they thought it was so bad.  I wonder how bad it could be.,Curious to dive deeper
1223," Im guessing really bad, four people wanted to sue the band after the show and Ive heard comments that it was terrible",Curious to dive deeper
1223," Yeah but it sounds like it's just your own fault and to not buy any more tickets to any future shows.  Seems like they went through an awful amount of work, but thats me. ",Curious to dive deeper
1223," I agree, I would just leave it as it is and never attend one of their concerts again, you know that in 1957 Truman refused to take a photo with Dumbo because of his political affiliations!",Curious to dive deeper
1223," Exactly, that is the logical thing to do, and no I didn't see that, but that is hilarious!",Curious to dive deeper
1223,It is funny! poor Dumbo didnt know why he was getting rejected.,Happy
1224," That trial reveal interesting things, the connections between Russians and cybercriminals",Curious to dive deeper
1224," Yes it did, I don't know that much about it, but I feel uncomfortable with Russia.",Curious to dive deeper
1224," I feel uncomfortable with Russia too. I am worried because of the ties with Trump, seems lot like House of Cards",Curious to dive deeper
1224," Yes that's true, but It's a gamble either way I look at it, US people afraid of them, especially when they were launching missiles so what do you do?",Curious to dive deeper
1224," Just hope Trump doesnt get confused while using the Nuclear football, Wikileaks is sure giving the government a hard time",Curious to dive deeper
1224," Yes you are right, the artner, Russian Bondars, 37 was found guilty for several hacking related crimes.",Curious to dive deeper
1224,I wonder how many years he got for that?,Curious to dive deeper
1224," I have any Idea, but I would guess very little, my reason is that the majority of the time people at the top behind it.",Curious to dive deeper
1224," Being  hacker must be a dangerous job, specially if you attemp or hack a country",Curious to dive deeper
1224," Yes you are right, because some countries, I can't say, but I pretty sure you know the penalty for that.",Curious to dive deeper
1224," Changing the subject a bit, do you like to shop at Target?",Curious to dive deeper
1224," Yes I used to, but If I am right, most of the Targets went out of business, I don't understand why, buy it wasn't lie walmart.",Curious to dive deeper
1224," I think Amazon has a lot to do with that, you know that a state senator also has to work at Target to make enough money!! thats just nuts",Surprised
1224," Yes it is, I lived in Phoenix, Arizona for 3 years, but that was six years ago.",Curious to dive deeper
1224," I used to live in Flagstaff, AZ, nice, you know that Best Buy and Target have a price matching featured, the  match the price of Amazon",Curious to dive deeper
1224," Yes, that's Interesting, traveling to and from work, I look up toward the sky, I see snow on the mountain which was flagstaff, when 85 degrees below,  wow.",Curious to dive deeper
1224," That is odd, Flagstaff has snows during winter and then Phoenix just  about 3 hours away is hot as hell, ",Curious to dive deeper
1224," Hahaha, yes, did you know Vermont is the only state in the US didn't had a target store?",Surprised
1224,No I dint know that the only state really? I wonder how many Targets stores are left in the country,Curious to dive deeper
1224," I pretty sure very little, back to what you said, I wonder what was this senator during with his money that he had to work at a target to make enough money to live?",Surprised
1224," I have no clue, I tried google searching that but I got no hits so maybe its false news.",Curious to dive deeper
1225," hey there, do you use the computer much?",Curious to dive deeper
1225,all the time. you?,Curious to dive deeper
1225," yes me too, need it for work and to run my personal things",Surprised
1225,Technology is in no way slowing down.,Curious to dive deeper
1225,for sure. the russians even made a computer that runs on water,Curious to dive deeper
1225,sounds oxymoronic. smoking nears apple computers voids its warranty.,Curious to dive deeper
1225,How would they know though they you have smoked. Or maybe if something happens to the computer then you have to tell them,Curious to dive deeper
1225," who knows. I'm told that best buy and target will price match Amazon, should keep them around a little longer, haha!",Curious to dive deeper
1225,yeah but what about vermont where there is no target store.,Surprised
1225,wow i wonder if thats personal.,Curious to dive deeper
1225," I really am not sure, they must have a good reason. State senators have to work at target to make enough money to live",Curious to dive deeper
1225,I do know that target hasn't carried tobacco products since 96.,Curious to dive deeper
1225,and the herbal supplements that they carry do not even contain any of the advertised herbs,Curious to dive deeper
1225,I think it has to do with CVS buying out their pharmacies.,Curious to dive deeper
1225," probably. and they are not the only ones, walmart, gnc and walgreens do the same thing",Curious to dive deeper
1225,good to know. on a different note Wikileaks published the governments attempt to destroy them.,Curious to dive deeper
1225,No wonder the government is always chasing them down and trying to shut them off,Surprised
1225," Right, he cooling hes heals in Russia now. That snowden i did like the movie they did about him. ",Curious to dive deeper
1225," I have not seen that yet, maybe I should some time soon. did you know the government owns 86% of the land in Nevada?",Curious to dive deeper
1225," Yes, I bet its because there a bunch of missile silo under ground. ",Curious to dive deeper
1225," Oh, I did not know that. it was nice chatting with you",Happy
1226,Do you like shopping at Target?,Curious to dive deeper
1226," i dont shop there often. it looks like a clean, upscale walmet.",Neutral
1226," That is true, and the prices are about the same. They don't sell tobacco though",Curious to dive deeper
1226,that is good of them. i wonder why they stopped. there is money in cigarettes.,Neutral
1226," Right, so much money. They havent sold them since like 1996",Curious to dive deeper
1226,I guess that they realized it looked better to stop selling something so dangerous. Target has banned salvation army bell ringers from its premises. i wonder why they did that.,Neutral
1226," wow, that is kind of sad. They would help out so much! Doesn't matter in Vermont, they don't have Targets",Curious to dive deeper
1226,is there something wrong with Vermont? does vermont hate target? i have questions.,Neutral
1226," I have so many too, what isn't there one in their biggest city lol",Curious to dive deeper
1226," yeah, i guess there are other stores there. walmart perhaps? Walmart, target, kmart, and kohl's were all founded in the same year. they might all be in vermont.",Neutral
1226," True, that is crazy all of those stores in the same year! Kmart is the first to fall out of those",Curious to dive deeper
1226," it is a tough business. the margins are razor thin. Did you know that Target corporation actually licensed the pseudo-french pronunciation ""target""? Tar-jay! LOL",Neutral
1226," lol I did not know that. Did you know best buy and target will price match amazon, I never knew that",Curious to dive deeper
1226," i figure that they have no choice at this point. this is a competitive market, and amazon has changed the rules of the game.",Neutral
1226," For sure, even computers at amazon are much lower than best buy that it would probably put them out of business to match those costs",Curious to dive deeper
1226,i dont want the other stores to disappear. it would be bad to end up with a monopoly. i havent shopped for computer for a while. i should check out amazon LOL,Neutral
1226," lol me neither, mine as well use amazon. I wonder if they have those water powered computers like russia used in 1936 lol",Curious to dive deeper
1226,that is funny! i wonder how fast those things ran. i wonder what they could do. arithmetic? LOL,Neutral
1226,Probably not much of anything if it was russia in 1936 lol! It was so nice chatting with you!,Curious to dive deeper
1226," It was fun chatting with you, too. ",Neutral
1226,Have a great weekend!,Curious to dive deeper
1227,Hey there. Are you a fan of Target?,Neutral
1227," Hi, yeah I like Target, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1227," I almost can't go to Target because I like it too much, haha. I didn't realize it's technically been around for over a hundred years.",Neutral
1227,I had no idea either. Did you know that Vermont is the only state without a Target store?,Curious to dive deeper
1227,That's crazy. I wonder why? Do people from Vermont not like affordable housewares and apparel and groceries?,Neutral
1227,I don't know that would interesting to find out. Maybe it's because Target doesn't carry tobacco products.,Curious to dive deeper
1227,Or maybe it's because 80% of the supplements they carry contain none of the advertised herbs.,Neutral
1227,Now that sounds a lot more likely. How do you think they get away with that?,Curious to dive deeper
1227," Apparently it's not just Target. Walmart, Walgreens, and even GNC, too.",Neutral
1227," That's terrible. You know I wouldn't want to work at Target. The world is dangerous enough without wearing a target on my back, don't you think?",Curious to dive deeper
1227,Haha. I wonder why they changed their name? It used to be Goodfellow Dry Goods.,Neutral
1227,Maybe because it's shorter and easier to remember. Do you shop more at Target or more at Walmart?,Curious to dive deeper
1227," Really? Goodfellow's? How is that harder than Target? Oh, I don't shop at Walmart. How about you?",Neutral
1227,I meant the whole name. Walmart is my go to store. Did you know that smoking near an Apple computer voids the warranty?,Neutral
1227," Yeah because it makes it a ""biohazard"".",Neutral
1227," Well, I was wondering if that includes second hand smoke, and could you sue someone for smoking near your computer and voiding the warranty.",Curious to dive deeper
1227,I would imagine it would be the laptop owner's fault for being somewhere smoking was allowed.,Neutral
1227,Could be. Do you know what a transhumanist is?,Neutral
1227," Haha, yeah. They're a little out there. Wanting to upload our minds into computers. Apparently, that'll probably happen someday. Anyway, it's been nice talking to you.",Neutral
1227,Some people won't take up much computer space. Nice talking to you have a nice evening.,Neutral
1227,You too.,Neutral
1228," hi, do you like music?",Curious to dive deeper
1228," hello,  yes I love music.  How about yourself?",Happy
1228,Yes I do. DO you have a favorite instrument?,Curious to dive deeper
1228," Yes,  I love the sound of the piano,  so beautiful,Do you?  ",Surprised
1228," Yes me too. The guitar also, I really like it",Curious to dive deeper
1228," Yes,  guitar is nice as well.  I recently learned that Matthew Bellamy has the guiness world record for most guitars smashed lol ",Surprised
1228,Hahah that must have been expensive too,Curious to dive deeper
1228," lol he probably doesnt care,  he was probably making a lot of money during this. ",Surprised
1228,I bet. Did you know brian may has a phd?,Curious to dive deeper
1228," I did not,  but I do not know who that is,  what band does he play for?",Surprised
1228,He plays for Queen and it is in astrophysics,Curious to dive deeper
1228," I see.  Have you seen Bohemian Rhapsody?  I really wanna see that movie,  but I think I have to wait for it to come out on dvd lol ",Neutral
1228,yeah I saw it it was pretty amazing,Surprised
1228,Oh good to know!,Neutral
1228,Do you listen to music?,Curious to dive deeper
1228," Considering I love music,  I definitely listen to it.  Did you know the Fender stratocaster was intended for country music?",Curious to dive deeper
1228,Cool. Do you know who Henry ford is?,Curious to dive deeper
1228," The guy who founded Ford?  He made cars,  thats all I really know. ",Surprised
1228,He financed country music too cause he thought jazz was taking over,Curious to dive deeper
1228,Did you know U2 opened for themselves a few times and dressed up in costume so no one would know lol,Surprised
1228,Hahaha yeah like the dalton brothers from gavelstone,Curious to dive deeper
1228,Its been good chatting!,Surprised
1228,Same here.,Happy
1229,Hello - how are you doing today?,Curious to dive deeper
1229,I'm good!  Do you like reading?,Happy
1229,I do like reading. What about you?,Happy
1229,I do!  Do you like science fiction?,Happy
1229,I'm not huge into science fiction. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
1229,Not much.  Starship Troopers however is the first sci-fi novel that's on the reading lists of 3 of the 5 US military branches.,Happy
1229,Oh wow I'm surprised. The world record for speed reading is held by Anne Jones. She read 4700 words per minute.,Surprised
1229,That's fast!  Bet she read a lot of books!  The FDA once burned 6 tons of literature in act of US censorship.,Happy
1229,That's a lot of literature. In the 18th century there was a moral panic because of the spread of the reading of novels.,Surprised
1229,Interesting!  I wonder if any of those were burned by the FDA? lol,Happy
1229,lol I was thinking the same thing.,Surprised
1229,Sir Winston Churchill won a nobel prize for literature.  I never knew that.,Happy
1229,Oh wow I didn't know that either. There is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence.,Surprised
1229,Neat.  Speaking of contests...literature was once an olympic event from 1912 to 1952.,Happy
1229,That's very interesting. Romantic kissing is a new development.,Surprised
1229,Who would have thought that?  It was rarely mentioned in Greek Literature.,Happy
1229,Do you like Shakespeare?,Curious to dive deeper
1229," I know of him, but wouldn't say I know much about him.  He coined some popular phrases that are still used today.",Happy
1229," He invented the names Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia. ",Surprised
1229,I never knew that!  Interesting!  He was alive at the same time as Pocahontas and they died only a year apart.,Happy
1229,It was good talking to you!,Happy
1230,Hello  how are you?  Do you like reading?Starship troopers is the first sci-fi novel on the reading lists of three of the five us military branches,Happy
1230," I did not know that, I find that interesting. Oh and yes I love to read. How are you today?",Curious to dive deeper
1230," Im doing great!  The world record for speed reading is held by anne jones, with a reading speed of 4,700 words per minute",Curious to dive deeper
1230,Glad to hear that you are well. I was just reading that. That is incredible.I can not imagine being able to read that fast! The FDA burned 6 tons of books. I never heard of this.,Surprised
1230," I wonder why they burned them,  that horrible.  Cs lewis and tolkien held ""you laugh you lose"" competitions when reading terrible poetry",Curious to dive deeper
1230," I find that funny they would do that. They were just regular people. Did you know that Architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture were olympic events? I can not imagine that either.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1230,Really?  that seems like unlikely categories! There is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel.,Curious to dive deeper
1230," There is really so much that most of us never hear about or learn about, one reason why reading is a wonderful thing. My Grandfather was one of those ""hobo travelers"" in the early 1900""s ",Neutral
1230,Oh really?  Thats interesting!  Romantic kissing is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even in ancient greek literature.,Neutral
1230," I had not realized that. I also never realized that Shakespeare had popularized phrases such as good -riddance, laughing stock and others. I have read very little of his works though. ",Curious to dive deeper
1230,I dont know a lot about shakespere so all of this is really interesting to me lol Pocahontas and shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.,Curious to dive deeper
1230,I also find information like this very interesting. Imagine Andre Tchaikowsky actually donated his skull in the hopes that it would be used as a prop.,Surprised
1230," haha.  Did it?  Shakespeare invented the names miranda, jessica, and olivia.",Neutral
1230,It says it was used in 2008 in productions of Hamlet. I never knew those names were invented by Shakespeare. In the 18th century there was a panic because people were reading novels.,Surprised
1230,thats seems weird that there would be a panic!  Reading is good for people lol,Surprised
1230,I am more panicked now because too many people are not reading. Reading is good! Learning new things is good.,Curious to dive deeper
1230," Shakespeare's works take on a different meaning when performed with an era-appropriate accent instead of a modern one, often introducing rhymes or puns that don't work in modern pronunciations.",Neutral
1230," LOL, yes I imagine that to be so because the pronunciation of some words were so different in that time. I will have to check out the On The Fly! Hobo Literature and songs books and get a feeling for my grandfathers youth lol",Curious to dive deeper
1230,does he have any cool stories?,Curious to dive deeper
1230,He died when I was a teen and only told me a few things when I was younger. Mostly funny things but he had a hard life then and I do not think he liked to recall it too much I wish he was around to hear more.,Neutral
1230," nice talking to you, have a good one",Neutral
1231,Hello,Curious to dive deeper
1231,Good morning! Guess how fast the fastest English rapper is!,Curious to dive deeper
1231," How fast? Rapper tupac shakur's music is in the library of congress of ""cultural significance.""",Curious to dive deeper
1231,14.1 syllables per second,Curious to dive deeper
1231," Wow, that's awesome.  Korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle, it's called ""compliment battle"".",Curious to dive deeper
1231,No way! There's also sign language rapping. Signmark rhymes in sign language.,Curious to dive deeper
1231,That's cool.  A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send neil armstrong and eleven other astronauts to the moon,Surprised
1231," Yes! And I wonder how people rhyme in sign language. Which signs rhyme? Is the rhyme based on the gesture, not the sound of the analogous word in spoken English?",Curious to dive deeper
1231," Before he became a rapper, eminem's true dream was to become a comic book artist. his favorite superhero was spider-man.",Sad
1231,I heard that. Did you know that McDonalds used to pay rappers for mentioning Big Macs?,Curious to dive deeper
1231,I read that somewhere.  I love Big Macs.,Neutral
1231,I'm not really into them. For $5? I don't know if it would be worth it.,Curious to dive deeper
1231,The michigan state university library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world,Happy
1231,That's surprising to me. You'd think the Library of Congress would have more.,Curious to dive deeper
1231," The marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth-199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book universe, earth-616.",Sad
1231,Interesting! Did you know that Michael Jackson tried to buy Marvel Comics?,Curious to dive deeper
1231," Wow, I didn't know that.  ",Neutral
1231," Yes, that was in the early 90's. He wanted to produce a film in which he would play Spider-Man.",Curious to dive deeper
1231," Haha, too funny.  Billie Jean vs Spider-Man",Curious to dive deeper
1231,Spider-Man is not my lover! Hahaha. I wonder what would have happened if he had succeeded in buying Marvel.,Curious to dive deeper
1231,Would probably have been odd to say the least.,Surprised
1232,Good morning!  Do you listen to country music?,Neutral
1232,Yes. Country music is also know as country and western music. It take root from genres from  Folk music.,Happy
1232,I like that alot of the songs use stringed instruments like guitars and fiddles.,Neutral
1232,Guitar is a musical instrument that has six strings which is played by plucking the strings. There are so many guitars.,Happy
1232,Yes there are.  Did you know that country music has some blues in it?,Neutral
1232,The legend George strait and the wealthiest man in the world Jeff bezos are cousins.,Happy
1232,That is really incredible!  I wonder if Amazon charges more for Strait's music or does something else to help his sales not that he needs any help but they are family after all.,Neutral
1232,Sure. George is great musician and both are family friends. That all only.,Happy
1232," Do you think country music would be popular today if Henry Ford hadn't been so afraid of jazz music and it's ""urban decadence""?",Neutral
1232,Henry ford helped the popularization of country music to make popular world wide.,Happy
1232," Yeah I know, he helped finance it.  I'm just saying that i wonder if things would be different if he hadn't.",Neutral
1232," Sure. Album is a collection of audio songs in CD, DVD. The music was developed in early 20th century.",Happy
1232,Yes it is.  Do you have any favorite albums?,Neutral
1232,24K is my favourite album. What about you ?,Happy
1232," I can't think of any off the top of my head.  I do know that linkin park's album, hybrid theory, is the best selling one of the century.",Neutral
1232,Reel big fish re-recorded all of their hits for a best of album after losing the rights to their old record label.,Happy
1232,That's a smart thing to do.  Have you heard about the 100 year old twins from japan that released a rap album back in 1992?,Neutral
1232,It is very interesting.,Happy
1232,i think so too. It is inspiring in a way.  Have you ever heard of Van Halen?,Neutral
1232,Yes. The famous American rock brand formed in 1972.,Happy
1232," I always thought it was impressive that Eddie Van Halen recorded the guitar solo for Michael Jackson's song Beat It.  They say when he did the recording he literally set the studio speakers on fire!  Well, it's time for me to go.  It's been nice chatting with you!  Have a great day!",Neutral
1233,Hey there!  Wondering if you have a favorite music album.  Not sure if younger generations nowadays know what albums are.  Everyone just knows singles I guess rather than a group's collection of songs.,Curious to dive deeper
1233," I honestly dont have one, mostly because most CD's have a couple good songs. How bout you?",Curious to dive deeper
1233," You know, I used to think that albums were just vinyls, but I read that collections on cassette tapes, CDs or other mediums can be considered albums.  I used to listen to my Footloose soundtrack on vinyl.  What CDs did you have?",Curious to dive deeper
1233," I just had a handful. Currently Collective Soul, Foo Fighters, and Linkin Park (which is apparently also the best selling album of his century)",Curious to dive deeper
1233," Really, I wouldn't have figured Linkin Park.  Weird.  Have you moved from CDs to MP3s?  Seems as though much of music has moved that way in the 21st century.",Curious to dive deeper
1233," I only have CDs for the vehicle, which doesnt have AUX, USB or bluetooth. I do stream often though when on computer or phone. Dark Side of the Moon was best selling for 40 years. Incredible.",Curious to dive deeper
1233,I think that's just great.  I did the whole synching Dark Side of the Moon with the Wizard of Oz thing.  Pretty creepy how well it matches. But I'm more of a Queen fan.  Did you know Queen's guitarist Brian May has a PhD in astrophysics?,Surprised
1233,Sounds about right. Multi-talented. He also uses coins for picks.,Surprised
1233,That's pretty creative.  I guess that's better than using your own fingernails as some people do.  Figure that could really crack your nails after a while.  You got any favorite guitarists?,Curious to dive deeper
1233," I think Dave Grohl is pretty talented, though he isnt actually an especially outstanding guitarist.",Neutral
1233," You know, it's a bit cliche but my favorite is Eddie Van Halen.  Even though I'm a fan, I didn't realize until recently that he did the guitar solo in Michael Jackson's Beat It!",Surprised
1233,Are you a country music listener?,Neutral
1233," Sure am.  Being a guitar fan, I love how country music uses all forms like acoustic, electric, steel.  I really like the steel guitar sound.  What part of country music do you like?",Curious to dive deeper
1233," I don't listen too often, though I did do a project on country rock in college and learned about rockabilly, which was pretty interesting.",Curious to dive deeper
1233,That must have been interesting.  I've heard the term hillbilly used in association with country music sometimes.  I guess it takes some of its roots from Appalachian folk music?,Curious to dive deeper
1233," From the reading, interesting to see that henry ford wanted to popularize country music out of fear for jazz.",Curious to dive deeper
1233,That's funny when you think of it now.  Scared of jazz music.  Music I was scare of?  NWA's Straight Outta Compton.  Their rap album just felt really angry.  But what was scarier was it reach such a great success in popularity.,Surprised
1233," Some people really appreciate angry level music, just like I feel like country songs are overly simple or sad sometimes.",Neutral
1233,I know what you mean.  Songs of the American working class or cowboy ballads.  Have that down trodden feel.  Even upbeat stuff like Achy Breaky Heart has a downer theme to it too huh?,Neutral
1233,Exactly. It says the opposite of how it really feels.,Curious to dive deeper
1233," Yeah, kinda masks the sentiment.  Speaking of ""masks,"" I read that U2 disguised themselves and performed country music as the opening act for their own concerts.  Wonder how that rock crowd felt about the country music.",Curious to dive deeper
1233," That's awesome, I also love U2",Curious to dive deeper
1234,Are you into country music?,Curious to dive deeper
1234," Not really, how about you?",Neutral
1234,It has grown on me a little. We can blame Henry Ford for helping it become popular because he feared jazz music,Surprised
1234," It is not my kind of music, but pretty cool that the fender statocaster was intended for country music.",Neutral
1234,Yeah but guitars shouldnt just be for one use. Eddie van halen did the solo for beat it. And it turned out pretty good,Happy
1234," The guitar is a pretty cool instrument. There are so many different ways to play it - as an acoustic, through an electrical amplifier, etc.",Neutral
1234,Even cool as a prop. Matthew Bellamy holds the record for most smashed on tour,Neutral
1234," I love muse, but it kind of makes me sad that he has ruined so many guitars.",Sad
1234,That is true. Did muse release any good albums?,Curious to dive deeper
1234," Yes they have a lot of good songs. Do you like Linkin Park? Their album ""hybrid theory"" is the best selling album of the 21st century.",Neutral
1234,I love them! Sad about chester. Im really surprised that they have that record with all the other great artist,Neutral
1234," I like them as well. Another good album ""dark side of the moon"" was one of the best sellers in 2014 even though it was released over 40 years ago - pretty cool.",Neutral
1234,Pink Floyd! They had one of their guitarist turn a grand house boat into a recording studio. Wonder which albums were recorded there,Curious to dive deeper
1234,That's pretty crazy to have a house boat recording studio. Also crazy that van halen set the studio speakers on fire recording a guitar solo!,Surprised
1234,Also crazy is Reel big fish re-recorded all of their hits for a best of album because they didnt have the rights to their own songs,Surprised
1234,Yeah it is crazy how the music industry works when it comes to copyrights and ownership of music (even if it was originally  your own music.),Neutral
1234,Do you have a favorite format for albums? I use to love collecting cds,Curious to dive deeper
1234," I used to collect cds. I still have several, but also listen to music on my phone a lot because it is convenient.",Neutral
1234,MP3 really changed music. Just like NWAs straight outta compton. They were able to hit platinum without radio play,Neutral
1234," Yes mp3 has, cds are becoming a thing of the past. Well it was nice talking to you.",Neutral
1234,have a good day!,Neutral
1235," Hey, do you read a lot?",Neutral
1235," Hi! I love reading! In fact, Starship Troopers is on my reading list because it's the first Sci-Fi novel to make the reading lists of three US military branches! What about you?",Happy
1235," I used to read a lot when I was younger and now, probably, read a lot of literature about business. I kind of regret about it. But I like sci-fi. It's so cool.Starship Troopers is a good choice. ",Curious to dive deeper
1235," Agreed. I figured if it made the military reading list, it must be good! I love reading but I'll never be able to top the world record for speed reading of 4700 words per minute that Anne Jones set. Ha!",Neutral
1235,I'm really wondering can this person express what was meaning of the text? 4700 words is crazy!,Curious to dive deeper
1235," I know, right? That just sounds unbelievable. Ha! What's almost as unbelievable to me is there was actually a moral panic over the spread of reading novels back in the18th century. It's like how and why would that lead to a moral panic?",Surprised
1235," Well, people are always strange. In the 20 century we've seen so many examples of concerns because of changes of society. But anyway we are alive haha",Neutral
1235,That is true. And let's not forget our own FDA burned six tons of literature in a censorship act. That almost makes me want to cry.,Sad
1235,Do you know what kind of literature was it? I'm just wondering...,Curious to dive deeper
1235," There's no telling, honestly. It's so hard to fathom our own FDA doing that! But on a more positive note, Winston Churchill won a Nobel Prize - not for peace -  but for literature back in 1953! I wonder if anyone else has ever won one for something other than peace?",Curious to dive deeper
1235," I don't know. What surprise me is a fact that literature, music, painting, sculpture and architecture were Olympic events from 1912 until 1952. Olympic events means were part of Games? Any idea about that?",Surprised
1235,That is surprising and I was honestly unaware of that. Wonder why they did away with it? What really surprises me is romantic kissing is hardly ever mentioned in ancient Greek literature. It's basically a recent development!,Surprised
1235,I think so. Ancient time had another vision of love and all sort of feelings. I guess even Shakespeare is example of that. Did you read him?,Neutral
1235," I did actually and am a huge fan of his! You know, he even invented the names Olivia, Miranda and Jessica which I found fascinating to discover that!",Happy
1235,I didn't know it. It's interesting! How did he do it? haha I guess his work at his historical perid was quite unusual and often criticised.,Surprised
1235," So true. But he coined and popularized so many different phrases from laughing stock to as luck would have it to break the ice to full circle to wild goose chase, etc.",Neutral
1235," True. By the way, do you know that there is sort of challenge when writers come up with worst possible opening sentence to a novel?",Neutral
1235," Is that so? I wonder if it was inspired by those ""You laugh, you lose"" competitions held by CS Lewis when he read terrible poetry? Ha!",Curious to dive deeper
1235," Haha. That's funny. It could be actually! By the way, do you mostly read books or e-books on devices?",Neutral
1235," I do enjoy both. In fact, I also read recently that Shakespeare and Pocahontas were actually alive at the same time and also sadly died one year apart. I found that to be both surprising and interesting!",Surprised
1235,It's nice. It looks like you are really fan of reading. It was my pleasure to chat with you. Have a good day!,Neutral
1235," It was great chatting with you as well! And before I go, I'd also like to recommend Ender's Game as it's another suggested reading book for US military branches! Have a great day, friend!",Neutral
1236,Lazy Lester recently passed away.  He was a great Cajun musician.,Neutral
1236," Yes, he was a great influence on musicians on both side of the Atlantic",Happy
1236,The guy could play harmonica.  He enjoyed making music anyway possible with whatever was at hand.,Curious to dive deeper
1236," Yes, he even played on cardboard boxes and used rolled up newspapers on snare drums",Happy
1236,He had the need to keep the beat going.,Neutral
1236,Apparently hiim being called Lazy referred to his relaxed and behind the beat singing style.,Curious to dive deeper
1236,The name fit him perfectly.  Musicianship ran in his family.  Slim Harpo was his cousin.,Neutral
1236,What was Slim Harpo famous for?,Curious to dive deeper
1236," Slim Harpo also played harmonica.  He wrote the song ""Shake your hips""...Don't move your head Don't move your hands Don't move your lips Just shake your hips...",Neutral
1236,It looks like Slim Harpo and Lazy Lester collaborated well,Happy
1236,All in the family.  But Lazy Lester got pushback when he wanted to record country music.,Neutral
1236,Was his country music any good?,Curious to dive deeper
1236,Don't know.  But the owner of the studio where he did his recordings refused to let him make the records.,Neutral
1236,Apparently Lester's Sugar Coated Love was brought to the country charts in 1977.,Surprised
1236,I believe Freddy Fender recorded the version that became popular.,Neutral
1236,Interesting. It seems like Lester's songs were rerecorded so interest in his songs were revived.,Surprised
1236," The Fabulous Thunderbirds recorded three of his songs, and that led the revival.",Happy
1236,And eventually Lester was persuaded to resume performing.,Curious to dive deeper
1236," Lester's album won a Blues Foundation award in 1988, when he started performing again after taking years off.",Neutral
1236,Lester was even inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame and he was featured in a Geico commercial.,Happy
1236,What a way to cap a career.,Happy
1237,do you know what the best selling album of the 21st century is?,Surprised
1237,Hello!  I don't know that I do.  What is it?,Curious to dive deeper
1237," haha  its linkin park's hybrid theory, I would not have guessed!",Happy
1237," Wow, me either!  Or that 40 years after making the album, Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"" was still one of the best selling albums of 2014!",Surprised
1237," wow that is wild, I like pink floyd a lot, what about you?",Happy
1237," I can't deny their influence, but I feel like I only know a few songs. ",Neutral
1237," ah ya you have to get into it and then you start appreciating more of their work, dark side of the moon is their best known album probably followed by the wall, but they have a lot of other great songs",Happy
1237,I heard that the guitarist for Pink Floyd actually converted a houseboat into a recording studio.,Surprised
1237," ah nice that is awesome and sounds like something they would do, I like van halen and its funny to know that a van halen solo literally set speakers on fire ",Surprised
1237," He is an amazing guitarist, but that's impressive.  I am a big fan of harder rock/metal music and it seems like Eddie Van Halen really put guitar virtuosity on the map!",Happy
1237," ya he did, I miss those days where that kind of music is popular, if he came out with that kind of music nowadays it wouldn't be mainstream which I think is sad",Happy
1237," I agree.  It seems like country music, which I am not a fan of, gets more top 40 play today than hard rock.",Disgusted
1237," yup thats a good point, I don't like country, I just can't take it seriously",Happy
1237,It's weird to me when bands like Bon Jovi or Def Leppard have released country songs or albums.,Disgusted
1237," haha, has def leppard released country songs? I like them I haven't heard of that",Surprised
1237," Well, I think they had a duet with Tim McGraw.  I guess the way I feel about country music is the more it sounds like something else, the more I like it.  So if it's a little more rock or blues or maybe even pop, and a lot less country.",Disgusted

1237," Jeff Bezos the wealthiest man in the world?  Must be nice, especially if George ever falls on hard times!",Surprised
1237," haha ya although with bezos getting divorced and losing half his money, that definitely could have bad consequences for george",Happy
1237,Good point.  Sometimes it pays to marry (and divorce) the right people I guess.,Sad
1237,ya I haven't been married yet but I definitely need to be careful haha,Curious to dive deeper

1238," Ah, I like to read books as well although they are all fiction ones.",Happy
1238,I love to read fiction as well. Do you like C.S. Lewis and Tolkien's crazy terrible poetry contests? The whole idea of keeping a straight face when reading terrible poetry is funny.,Surprised
1238," Haha, that is. Did you know that the FDA burned 6 tons of literature?",Surprised

1238,Ah. Shakespeare invented the names jessica and olivia. I know some people named them from highschool!,Surprised
1238," I didn't realize that. I use one of his favorite phrases, ""good riddance"", frequently.",Curious to dive deeper
1238," Wow, I also use that phrase all the time. I guess Shakespeare has invented many things.",Surprised
1238,His impact as part of the play company Lord Chamberlain's Men changed London.,Surprised
1238," Shakespeare also invented the quote ""a laughing stocks"". I used that yesterday!",Surprised
1238,Another great phrase. It is rather tragic that he died at age 52. That time period had such a short life expectancy.,Sad
1238,Imagine if he lived until 80. Maybe he would have created so much more different unique phrases!,Happy
1238," That and many more brilliant literary works. He was so revered that the Polish composer Andre Tchaikowsky donated his skull to Shakespeare's company, hoping they would use it as a prop. That is just a bit odd if you ask me.",Surprised
1238," I wonder what they would do with a skull. Anyways, nice chatting with you!",Happy
1238,I guess he hoped it would be used as the skull of yorick. Nice chatting.,Neutral
1238," Yep, nice chatting with you too!",Happy
1238,I hope I will be remembered as fondly as Shakespeare someday.,Happy
1238," Haha, hopefully, I wish that too! Bye!",Happy

1240,Do you read comic books?,Curious to dive deeper
1240,I do every now and then.  Do you read any?  I like marvel and dc myself.,Neutral
1240," Me too, I prefer marvel over Dc but i like them both. Stan lee used to write for both",Curious to dive deeper
1240,I didn't know that!  So did he quit dc to start marvel then?,Neutral
1240," I am not sure, I think he only wrote 15 comics so I wonder if he was a special guest writer. He also coined the word excelsior!",Curious to dive deeper
1240,He did!  That's cool.  Did you know that comic books started in Japan back in the 18th century?,Neutral
1240," I wonder what they were about, samurai?",Curious to dive deeper
1240," I don't know actually but when they got started in the U.S. in 1933 they were just funny, not super hero related.",Neutral
1240," I may have to google the early ones, I am interested now. I just google dc and it stands for detective comics",Curious to dive deeper
1240,That makes their name odd then. Their name is dc comics and yet dc stands for detective comics. so comics is stated twice.,Neutral
1240," lol, that is a valid point! Detective comic comics is catchy!",Curious to dive deeper
1240," It actually kind of is!  Did you know that the whole ""comic book"" thing comes from america. I guess that kind of explains what japan's were back in the day. They must have been serious because when america started them they were just funny strips.",Neutral
1240,that may have been the reason they didn't like us! Do you like rap music much?,Curious to dive deeper
1240,Not really.  Do you?,Neutral
1240," Somewhat, I just remember always busta rhymes being reptar in the movie the rugrats lol. ",Curious to dive deeper
1240," that's cool.  Hey, I just remembered something.  Eminem had a dream to become a comic book artist before he became a rapper.",Neutral
1240," Man he should have co wrote one with Stan Lee, I would have read that. Did you hear about rap battles in North Korea?",Curious to dive deeper
1240,No I didn't. What is that about?,Neutral
1240,They have compliment battles instead or roasting battles. I would love to be part of one lol,Curious to dive deeper

1241," Sure, I do. How about you? I like Tupac. His music is in the library of congress of ""cultural significance.""",Surprised
1241," yeah I can see that, the guy made revolution with his music. do you like him?",Curious to dive deeper
1241," Sure, and I also like Eminem. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1241,Yeah me too. did you know he wanted to be a comic book artist originally?,Curious to dive deeper
1241," Yeah, I heard that. Glad he didn't. I heard his favorite character is Spiderman.",Happy
1241," Yeah, I guess he can still do that if he wants. do you know busta rhymes?",Curious to dive deeper
1241,I have heard of him. He played the voice of the Reptar Wagon in the 1998 Rugrats movie. I guess rap has become very mainstream. A Michigan judge delivered her ruling in rap form when trying a suit against Eminem.,Surprised
1241,I would have liked to hear the ruling. do you know about compliment battle?,Curious to dive deeper
1241,I heard they do that in Korea. Would you watch or listen to one of those?,Curious to dive deeper
1241,I would like to listen to it out of curiosity. do you read comic books?,Curious to dive deeper
1241," No, I did when I was little. What about you? Do you like DC or Marvel?",Curious to dive deeper
1241," I like them both, I like superhero books and movies so yeah. do you know Stan Lee?",Curious to dive deeper
1241," Yeah, he used to end every phone conversation he had with the word ""excelsior!""",Surprised
1241,the guy was a legend. do you know what DC in DC comics stands for?,Curious to dive deeper
1241," It stands for detective comics, so their name is redundant. Detective comics comics.",Surprised
1241,that is so cool. I guess nowadays we can find so much info on Google alone,Curious to dive deeper
1241," Yeah, and a lot of us use it. One day Google went down for five minutes and took 40 percent of web traffic with it.",Surprised
1241,that is crazy. do you know how they calculate traffic?,Curious to dive deeper
1241,Through Android phones. I wonder if you have to consent to that or it does it automatically,Fearful
1241,Maybe there is some fine print in the phones when we get them. nice chat,Happy
1242,Hi there. do you like rap music?,Curious to dive deeper
1242," I do, do you have a favorite rapper? ",Curious to dive deeper
1242,I do I like Kanye a lot. I also like Eminem. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
1242," Yeah, he is really good. When I was younger though I listened to a lot of Tupac. ",Curious to dive deeper
1242,Isn't it weird that his music is in the Library of Congress? I haven't heard much of his stuff what are some good albums,Curious to dive deeper
1242," Yeah, it is sort of weird, but not really when you think about it. He is a part of our history. ",Curious to dive deeper
1242,Yep I agree with that. Did you know that Eminem's favorite superhero as a kid was Spider-Man?,Curious to dive deeper
1242," No, I wonder why that is? In Korea they have compliment battles. ",Curious to dive deeper
1242,Have you ever seen a diss battle? I like the idea of a compliment battle a lot more haha,Curious to dive deeper
1242," Hahaha, I hear they do that in Korea a lot! ",Happy
1242,That's what I've heard too. Will you believe a Michigan judge gave her ruling in the form of a rap when she was with Eminem. haha,Surprised
1242," Do you use google when you search for information online, or Bing? ",Curious to dive deeper
1242,Well I use Bing because they pay you for each search haha but Google definitely does a better job with the search results. What do you use?,Curious to dive deeper
1242," They pay people for each search? How is that, can you explain? ",Curious to dive deeper
1242,Just do a search for Bing Rewards and you can find more but the thing I like about Google is how good their searching is and that a single Google search uses more computing power than they used to send an astronaut to the Moon hahaha,Surprised
1242," Yeah, Google does have some good products. Apparently they have goats to eat grass at their headquarters. ",Curious to dive deeper
1242,Haha that's a good idea. That saves money on gas. I wonder if you could do that with just regular people's houses. That would be good for the greenhouse gases I think,Curious to dive deeper
1242,That's true. When google went down for 5 minutes it took down 40% of web traffic.,Curious to dive deeper
1242,Wow that's a lot. I love Google in Google Maps it's great how that they can track the real-time traffic flow using just Android phones out on the roads,Surprised
1242," Yeah, that is pretty cool. I didn't know it was just androids though. I would figure it was anyone with Google Maps. ",Curious to dive deeper
1242,Yeah you're probably right. It's cool that Google is founded only 1998. That seems like a long time ago but actually it's not really.,Surprised
1243,hi how are you? do you like horror films?,Neutral
1243,I love horror films.,Happy
1243,I dont usually watch horror. What is your favorite?,Neutral
1243," So many it's hard to choose. The Thing, The Shining, Texas Chainsaw. So many. Do you like Stephen King?",Curious to dive deeper
1243,You like the blood and gore type. I prefer the spooky type. King is a great writer. His stories work well on the screen.,Neutral
1243,I like both. I don't like them too gory or gory for the sake of being gory. I don't like torture porn. Did you know that King says the first horror movie he saw was Bambi?,Curious to dive deeper
1243," He was a sensitive child, but i understand. i would have been afraid during bambi too. He turned his fear into a career.",Neutral
1243,Those old Disney movies are rough. Did you also know that Christopher Nolan meant for Inception to be a horror movie?,Curious to dive deeper
1243,That would not work. it is already ominous enough. it does not need blood and stuff.,Neutral
1243,I agree. Have you seen The Exorcist?,Curious to dive deeper
1243," Yes, great film. i really enjoyed it. spooky, supernatural stuff. directors cut is good.",Neutral
1243,No one involved in filming it thought it would be considered a horror film. I wonder how in the world they thought that?,Curious to dive deeper
1243,That is an odd conclusion. i guess they thought it was a love story. satanic love story.,Neutral
1243,I'm not sure what they thought they were filming. Did you also know that the writer of Rocky Horror voices the dad on Phineas and Ferb?,Curious to dive deeper
1243,i did not know that. it is a small world. i guess that the writer is also a talented actor.,Neutral
1243,I guess so. Did you ever hear what the original title for Scream was?,Curious to dive deeper
1243,I did not. was it a funny title?,Neutral
1243,It was Scary Movie.,Neutral
1243," That is a pretty good title. a little campy, a little high concept.",Neutral
1243,It's hard for me to picture it with that title now because I associate it with the spoof movie that came a few years later.,Neutral
1243," I think that the title of the movie is important. for example, shawshank redemption. how would anyone know that kind of movie it is?",Neutral
1243,It is hard to get the plot from that title. It was nice chatting with you. Have a good night.,Neutral
1244," Cinematography has surely become an art, what are your thoughts about this?",Curious to dive deeper
1244,I don't think much about the art. I usually pay attention to the plot and characters.,Neutral
1244," I see, what kind of films do you like? I enjoy horror films a lot",Curious to dive deeper
1244," I usually don't watch horror. It's interesting that If you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art, you will enjoy the art more. I'm not really into abstract art though.",Neutral
1244," I'm not really into abstract art either but it sure is an interesting fact, Edgar Allan Poe inspired this genre greatly, his poems are really dark so I can see why",Curious to dive deeper
1244," Poe was an innovator. The horror genre has its fans. It's odd that Danny, the boy from The Shining, did not know he was acting in a horror film until several years later.",Neutral
1244," I wonder how the production tricked him lol, I mean its a really scary movie and his in some really scary scenes.",Curious to dive deeper
1244," I wonder what kind of movie he thought it was. Stephen King had a better sense of horror as a child. He was terrified when he saw the movie Bambi, calling it the first horror movie he saw.",Neutral
1244," I thought that was really funny as well, Stephen King, the king of terror and he was afraid of Bambi, I wonder if they used a water phone in the production of Bambi.",Curious to dive deeper
1244,I wonder what a water phone looks like! A saxophone with water?,Curious to dive deeper
1244," I have no idea but I will look it over later, it can be a handy tool for horror movies, the metallic noises must be really creepy and scary with the right setup.",Curious to dive deeper
1244," Back to cinematography, no woman has ever been nominated for the Academy Award for best cinematography.",Neutral
1244," That seems kind of unfair, I wonder if this is a sexist thing. Theres a famous cinematographer called Roger Deakins, do you know who he is?",Curious to dive deeper
1244,Never heard of him.,Neutral
1244," Well he was nominated 13 times for the best cinematography Oscar but never won the award, that must be really frustrating.",Curious to dive deeper
1244," Constant recognition, but no award. You're right, very frustrating. Have you heard of Chinese-American James Wong Howe?",Curious to dive deeper
1244," No I haven't heard about him, any interesting facts?",Curious to dive deeper
1244," A great cinematographer. He pioneered the use of wide-angle lenses, low-key lighting, crab dolly and deep-focus cinematography. ",Neutral
1244," I bet that changed things in the cinematography world, I bet he won an award because of that.",Curious to dive deeper
1244,He did win Oscars. He ran afoul of the law though. His marriage with a white woman was illegal until 1948 due to racism.,Neutral
1244," I see, that makes sense after all he did make a valuable contribution and that is unfair, thank God things are different now.",Curious to dive deeper
1245,Do you watch youtube?  I don't know anyone who doesn't.  It is the second largest search engine on the net.,Curious to dive deeper
1245,I definitely watch youtube. Do you?,Happy
1245," Sure thing!  Justin Bieber isn't too popular with his song ""Baby"" though as it is the most disliked video on Youtube",Surprised
1245,Oh! Why don't people like the song?,Surprised
1245," Not sure, maybe they are mad at him.  If you watch Netflix, then you are joining along with Youtube viewers half of the peak internet traffic in north america.  I wonder what would happen if there was a boycott youtube day?",Curious to dive deeper
1245,I wouldn't want that to happen. Do you think that will happen?,Neutral
1245," Never know, but don't foresee it happening.  Police watch their own form of youtube called ""blutube"" so they can share law enforcement videos.",Surprised
1245,Interesting. Did you know that YouTube started out as a dating site?,Curious to dive deeper
1245," I wasn't aware, but google bought the site in November 2006 for $1.65 billion ",Surprised
1245,That's a lot! Do you like looking up at the stars?,Surprised
1245,If I can see them.  Bill Nye is executive director of the planetary society.  I would like to join his club.,Curious to dive deeper
1245,What does the club do?,Curious to dive deeper
1245,I just like his programs that make science fun to watch on tv.  So his planetary society I imagine is incredible.,Surprised
1245,Oh Ok. Did you know that the Vatican has its own observatory?,Neutral
1245,I didn't know that.  Ancient babylonians had a great understanding of astronomy and could track planets like jupiter with math precision,Surprised
1245,That's fascinating! Do you prefer theoretical or observational astronomy more?,Surprised
1245,I think observational because there is so much out there in the universe to see.  What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
1245,I like observational too. Do you like to travel the world since we can't travel to space just yet?,Curious to dive deeper
1245,I would like to travel the world if I had money.  But I can watch Youtube and enjoy the world along with all the other web surfers on the second largest search engine!,Curious to dive deeper
1245,Sounds good. Did you know air travel is slower now than in the 60's in order to save on fuel?,Neutral
1245,Seemed pretty fast to me! But if you prefer bus travel you can get there quick on the future Dutch commuter bus that will go 160 mph,Surprised
1246,Hi! Can you believe a Florida legislator's aide said two of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivors were actors? That is sad!,Sad
1246," It's despicable, but unfortunately I can believe it. Some people are so willing to believe in conspiracies that support their politics that they decide to disregard basic human decency. He claimed that there's a YouTube video that's proof!",Disgusted
1246," Agreed. I know people make mistakes and put politics and beliefs befoee country, but I'm glad the aide was fired. Perhaps it'll teach Benjamin to think next time. I love traveling to Florida often, but that makes me hesitant. Speaking of traveling, do you like to travel?",Neutral
1246," Not so much recently, but I have been to other places, and it's always interesting to see how they go about transportation differently than in the U.S. Iceland doesn't even have public rail service!",Curious to dive deeper
1246," Isn't that crazy? Imagine having to travel by domestic flight from major town to town. Boy, we Americans don't realize how good we truly have it! Ha! Just like in Japan, it costs over $300 just to travel the country due to their highways being tolls! That is insane!",Surprised
1246," Yes, that certainly gives people incentive to carpool or take buses. Speaking of which, the Dutch are designing a commuter bus that can travel at 160 MPH--seems a little over the top to me!",Surprised
1246," Agreed. I would be too afraid to ride on that. Ha! That is interesting though. Perhaps I can find out more information on it somewhere on YouTube. Being the second largest search engine, I'm sure there are plenty of videos on it.",Curious to dive deeper
1246," Yes, there are probably plenty of videos uploaded of people traveling, too. With Netflix, it makes up half of peak internet traffic in North America.",Neutral
1246,So true! Crazy to think Google purchased it for $1.65 billion. That's probably the wisest billion dollars ever spent considering how popular YouTube is today!,Surprised
1246," Yes, it's become so ubiquitous that even other media corporations upload some of their content to it, like CBS and the BBC.",Neutral
1246," Indeed! Heck, even police have their own version of YouTube entitled ""Blutube"". I suppose it's like being able to watch the show cops anytime you please. Ha!",Neutral
1246," Yes, and I'm sure that some of their law enforcement videos would fall under the category of ""educational"" or ""documentary"" on actual YouTube haha.",Neutral
1246," So true! Ha!  Speaking of educational, I enjoy astronomy videos and just learning about astronomy in general. It's amazing because through astronomy, they were able to figure out the date Odysseus took back the throne of Ithaca was April 16th 1178 BC. It's amazing what astronomy teaches us!",Happy
1246," Yes, astronomy requires a lot of complex mathematics and precision in order to figure out how everything relates. The data from observations is analyzed using basic principles of physics, although I'm sure it is much more complicated than that!",Curious to dive deeper
1246," So true and it is! It's fascinating. In fact, even the ancient Babylonians were able to track planets like Jupiter with mathematical precision. They indeed had a sophisticated understanding of astronomy!",Happy
1246," Yes, the ancient Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Nubians, Chinese, Maya, and Iranians also performed methodical astronomical observations. Astronomy truly is universal haha.",Neutral
1246," It is, Isn't it? It's amazing how professional astronomy is split into two different fields and yet the two fields compliment each other perfectly, Isn't it?",Happy
1246," Yes, the back and forth between theory and observations seems to drive all science, but given how vast the universe is, it's even more important for to find evidence to supports models and vice versa. A critical step in the creation of wifi was actually a byproduct of research into improving astronomy imaging--probably has something to do with radio waves!",Curious to dive deeper
1246,That's simply phenomenal and almost unbelievable! Even Bill Nye serves as executive director of the Planetary Society which just so happened to be founded by Carl Sagan!,Surprised
1246,It's a good thing that Bill Nye was able to make science popular before the age of easy access to such vast amounts of information on YouTube!,Neutral
1246," So true! He was truly an innovator in the field! He was the first in my opinion, much like Hawaii's King Kalakaua was the first king to ever travel the world. He and and Bill Nye are truly respected in my opinion! Well it was great chatting with you!",Neutral
1247," hi, do you travel?",Curious to dive deeper
1247," Not frequently, it's not really my thing. I don't mind exploring but I'm more of a homebody.",Neutral
1247,oh that is cool too. did you know the dutch are building a bus that goes 160 moh,Curious to dive deeper
1247," Yes, that seems unnecessary, although it certainly beats driving. Did you know that all highways in Japan are toll roads? That makes bus travel much more attractive!",Neutral
1247," Yeah, it costs you $300 to travel the country",Curious to dive deeper
1247,That's like a domestic flight ticket! Did you know that's how most people in Iceland without cars travel between major towns?,Neutral
1247," yeah that is insane, although the flights must be short",Curious to dive deeper
1247," Considering the hassle of flying, maybe it'd make more sense just to watch a YouTube video haha",Neutral
1247,hahhaa yeah maybe. do you watch much youtube?,Curious to dive deeper
1247,Here and there. It's a great way to watch pieces of programs or performances that I don't want to watch in whole.,Neutral
1247,that is true. it is the second largest search engine on the net,Curious to dive deeper
1247," That's pretty crazy. Apparently police have their own version of YouTube for sharing law enforcement videos, I wonder how that compares!",Surprised
1247,yeah that is interesting. do you know the most disliked video in there?,Curious to dive deeper
1247," Apparently it is Justin Bieber's ""Baby"", which probably makes sense because it's also probably got a lot of views",Neutral
1247,yeah. have you hear the gangnam song?,Curious to dive deeper
1247," Yes, years ago. YouTube had to upgrade the view count integer in order to accommodate it!",Surprised
1247," yeah that is insane, it shot up to billions of views",Curious to dive deeper
1247," Yes, those videos make up a lot of internet traffic. Did you know that 400 hours of content are uploaded to YouTube per minute?",Curious to dive deeper
1247,that is just insane. do you know how wifi was created?,Curious to dive deeper
1247," No, did it have something to do with radio?",Curious to dive deeper
1247,with astronomy really. nice chat,Happy
1248," Hello, do you like Cinematography?",Surprised
1248," I love cinematography. One of my favorite DPs, Roger Deakins, has been nominated 14 times -- and but won only once for Bladerunner 2049 last year. ",Happy
1248,That's pretty cool. Did you know no woman has ever been nominated for an academy award for best cinematography?,Surprised
1248,That's depressing. It's the only Oscar category that has never had a female nominated. Hopefully that will change soon.,Surprised
1248,I bet it will change soon with all of the feminist movements taking place these days.,Surprised
1248," Stanley Kubrick did most of the cinematography for Spartacus, but wasn't listed as the official DP. So when then Oscars rolled around and the movie got a nomination, Kubrick wasn't named. ",Happy
1248,Oh wow I didn't know that. Do you like horror films?,Curious to dive deeper
1248," Depends on the film, but yeah. Speaking of Kubrick, he made on of the all time greats -- The Shining. The child actor who played Danny didn't know he was in a horror film until several years later. ",Happy
1248,Those are such great movies. Stephen King was scared of the movie Bambi when he was a child.,Surprised
1248," Haha. Well, he got revenge on the world for that didn't he? Apparently watching a horror movie burns 180 calories. I need to start the Wes Craven diet. ",Surprised
1248,Wow that's cool. I didn't know that. Definitely a good way to burn calories.,Surprised
1248,Also if you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art you're supposed to enjoy the art more. Wonder who did the study to figure that out? Sounds like a studio gimmick.,Happy
1248,Not too sure on that. The majority of creepy metallic noises in horror movies are produced by a waterphone.,Surprised
1248,I wonder what that instrument looks like and how it's played.,Curious to dive deeper
1248,Not too sure on that one. I'd like to see one though.,Surprised
1248," Pixar studios has a secret room that celebrities visit. I had a friend who worked there and he said there were tons of secret rooms, especially for animators and writers. ",Happy
1248,That is awesome. I love Pixar movies. They are such good quality. Do you like Pixar?,Curious to dive deeper
1248," Yeah, I agree. Toy Story 2 and Inside Out make me cry every time! Did you know Robin Williams' work in Aladdin started the trend for big name actors to do animated films?",Happy
1248," Did you know Judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode?",Surprised
1248,That is crazy! Meanwhile teachers are making $35k.,Happy
1248,It was good talking to you!,Happy
1249," Hello Are you a Stephen King fan? I am, and was surprised to learn that the movie Bambie, terrified him as a kid.",Surprised
1249," Yes I am! I feel as if his books are much more terrifying than Bambi. I do not enjoy horror films, do you?",Surprised
1249," I think it depends on how it's done. I'm curious to see how it really does affect abstract art. Supposedly, if you watch a horror movie first, you will enjoy that style of art more.",Curious to dive deeper
1249," That's very interesting, also surprising that watching horror movies can burn more than 180 calories! I wonder how many calories watching a comedy film can burn.",Surprised
1249," That would be interesting to find out. I wonder if its due to horror movies raising our heart rates.I guess when it comes down to it, my tastes are more of the macabre and supernatural. over the thriller genre.",Curious to dive deeper
1249," Yeah, it might be, so that also means that when I visit theme parks, I can burn calories by riding roller coasters!  I also enjoy those genres, but I also enjoy Pixar films and apparently Pixar Studios has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities, I don't know what the secret room is for though.",Surprised
1249," I love Pixar movies, and would love to go in there. Have you heard about the happy old main in Ethiopia, who cooks for his village? He has a YouTube channel, Grandpa Kitchen.",Happy
1249," Yeah! Me too! No I have not heard of that. Does that mean he is a celebrity TV chef? I really admire those celebrities who use their status as a platform to promote good to society, like the old man who cooks for his village.",Happy
1249," He's not really a celebrity in the traditional sense. Just a wealthy, retired contractor who is trying to help curb the hunger problem, by cooking more diverse foods. You should really check out his channel.",Happy
1249," Oh wow! I will! I really enjoy watching shows related to cooking. I wonder how much he is able to make per video. Judge Judy makes over $120K per episode, making her the highest paid celebrity after Lebron James. I feel as if there are celebrities who get paid more than her though.",Surprised
1249," Yeah, that doesn't seem right, as I remember reading somewhere that Hugh Laurie (House) received almost a million per episode.",Curious to dive deeper
1249," Yes I heard about that too and he also mentioned that in real life, Hugh's father is a physician, but Hugh makes way more than what his father makes. ",Surprised
1249,He's also a singer. I didn't know that until he appeared on Sesame Street. I guess Carol Burnett was the first celebrity who found out how to get to Sesame Street.,Curious to dive deeper
1249," Oh he is?! Now that's news to me! I wonder if Carol Burnett has ever been nominated for an award, apparently no woman woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography and it's the only category that has never nominated a female!",Surprised
1249," Isn't that awful? There are so many women director's that it is almost incomprehensible that Hollywood is that sexist. Yet, Roger Deakins has been nominated 13 times and never won.",Surprised
1249," Yeah, it's pretty surprising! It'll be more of a surprise if Roger Deakins actually wins! I enjoy cinematography, but need to practice on my editing skills.",Surprised
1249,One of my favorite movies is Aladdin. I thought celebrities were voicing movies long before Robin Williams voiced Jaffar.,Curious to dive deeper
1249," Yeah! I like that movie too, I might've thought that was a horror film in my younger years when I first saw it as a kid. ",Surprised
1249," Yeah, it does have that quality about it. I'm really looking forward to LeBron making Space Jam 2. I live in the Akron area, and his premiere will be in Akron, and used for a fundraiser for his school I'm excited for that to happen;",Happy
1249,I didn't know there was a Space Jam 2 coming out! I loved the first movie. I wonder if he will be the highest paid celebrity for that movie role.,Curious to dive deeper
1249," I'm sure he will be, as his production company is the one who will be in charge of it. Thank you for chatting with me, have a wonderful night.",Happy
1250,Hey how are you? Do you travel much?,Curious to dive deeper
1250,I am doing good. No I dont really get to travel to often. I love to travel though.,Curious to dive deeper
1250," For sure, it's a lot of fun, wish I could do it more. If you go to Iceland just remember it has no public rail system.",Curious to dive deeper
1250,I heard that. Most people without cars must take domestic flights to travel between major cities.,Neutral
1250," That would really be crazy. Even in Mackina Island, MI where they banned motorized vehicles, most travel is done by horses or bikes still.",Curious to dive deeper
1250,That would be cool to see. It would be like going back in time or something. Lol.,Neutral
1250," For sure, those horses are probably tired of taking everyone in those carriages though haha.",Surprised
1250,Probably. Did you know that all the highways in japan are toll roads. It costs them more than 300 to travel across country.,Happy
1250," Oh wow, that's good to know. I'm actually going to Japan on Wednesday ha. ",Curious to dive deeper
1250,Thats cool. Are you going for business or pleasure?,Curious to dive deeper
1250," For fun, with my wife and her parents. It should be a lot of fun, I have never been there before but heard it's great. We're taking the bullet trains so won't need that $300 ha. Where's the coolest place you've traveled to?",Curious to dive deeper
1250,Probably New York. I just drove through really but it was awesome to see the city at night like that.,Happy
1250," I bet, lots of bright lights and tall buildings, it is a very cool place to go. You ever use Youtube?",Curious to dive deeper
1250,I use it all the time. Anytime I need to learn how to do something there is a video for it.,Happy
1250," Me too, it's crazy that Google bought it for 1.65 billion in 2006, I wonder how much it is worth now. It was created a year before that even.",Curious to dive deeper
1250,Also now google owns both of the most used search engines on the internet.,Neutral
1250,What is the other search engine that it owns?,Curious to dive deeper
1250,Google.com and youtube. Lol.,Happy
1250," Haha, I never thought of youtube like a search engine but it most definitely is. Are you into astronomy very much? One of the critical steps in creating wi-fi was a byproduct of research into improving the astronomy imaging they had available.",Curious to dive deeper
1250,That is really interesting. Did you know bill nye is executive director of the planetary society,Happy
1250," I never knew that honestly. I'm going to take off though, it was great chatting with you, take care!",Curious to dive deeper
1251,Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;),Happy
1251,I agree! Where are you from?,Curious to dive deeper
1251," Originally from Poland but now I'm in Long Island, NY. You ?",Curious to dive deeper
1251,Oh fun! I'm from Iowa but live in Colorado. Do you watch superhero movies?,Curious to dive deeper
1251,Since I could open my eyes ;) lol,Curious to dive deeper
1251," Well did you know The ""A Wrinkle in Time"" director will reportedly direct the film version of ""New Gods,"" one of DC Comics' most cherished properties?",Curious to dive deeper
1251,New Gods ? I'm sorry what is that... was there a comic book like that ? Or will it be something like... a mix of superheroes ?,Curious to dive deeper
1251,It looks like a mix of superheroes. A lot besides superman and batman.,Happy
1251,...so... it's going to be a DC Universe based ?,Curious to dive deeper
1251," It looks like it. did you know The dc from dc comics stands for detective comics, so their company name is redundant?",Curious to dive deeper
1251,I was always wondering what it stands for ! Thank You ! ;) wow... what a relief to finally know that ;),Curious to dive deeper
1251," Here's another great fact from the articles: Marvel published a ""generic comic book"", in order to trademark the names ""super-hero"" and ""super-villain""",Curious to dive deeper
1251,oh that's cool... I wonder what was first... Marvel or DC ?,Curious to dive deeper
1251,I think it was DC but it's a 50/50 guess lol.,Happy
1251,lol ;) yes IT IS ;) did You know that nintendo entertainment system could display only 54 colors ?,Curious to dive deeper
1251,I believe it! I remeber those games used to be pretty simple colors. It's sad the nintendo entertainment system was finally discontinued in september of 2003 in japan.,Curious to dive deeper
1251," lol, probably. But You know what - even with those 54 colors... my tV back then had only two colors ;)",Curious to dive deeper
1251,I will never know that feeling haha. Did you play nintendo back in they day? I was a SEGA guy.,Happy
1251," I started with Timex, then ZX Spectrum in early 80s, than commodore 64 and Nintendo :) lol, then Amiga, than a first PC xt86, than at86 and then finall first Pentium90 :) I was always a gamer ;) lol",Curious to dive deeper
1251,I don't even know those systems haha.,Surprised
1251,lol ;) this is a blast from the past :) my family was always into new technologies ;),Happy
1251,Mine really wasn't. We did get playstation when it first came out though.,Curious to dive deeper
1251,I've never switched to consoles where You have to play with a controller. I'm staying loyal to mouse and keyboard :),Curious to dive deeper
1251,I couldn't do that but I wish. Well have a good one I think we're done!,Curious to dive deeper
1252,Are you or have you even been into comic books?,Curious to dive deeper
1252," yes, I once visited the library at MSC, they have the biggest collection in the world",Curious to dive deeper
1252,Wow. I was surprised to learn that began in 18th Century Japan and did hit the US until the 1930s,Surprised
1252,yeah that is a long time for sure. did you know how marvel trademarked the names superhero and supervillain?,Curious to dive deeper
1252," Those seem like sort of generic terms to me... But I suppose ""Wonder Woman"" is a trademarkable term although many women are wondrous. ",Angry
1252,true. did you watch the movie?,Curious to dive deeper
1252,I haven't yet.  Was it good?  Better than The Last Jedi?,Curious to dive deeper
1252,It was really good. and also the highest grossing superhero origin move,Surprised
1252,Sounds entertaining like the 54 color Nintendo Entertainment System was when it first came out.,Angry
1252,i know right. too bad it was discontinued in japan in 2003,Curious to dive deeper
1252,Things move so fast in microchip land.  At least it's not going backwards and re-adopting chickens for entertainment.,Angry
1252,that is interesting for sure. did you know reagan once auditions for a movie?,Surprised
1252," Yeah, he was in many.  Mostly the ""hero"" type.  He was however rejected for a role as a ""president""",Surprised
1252,haha that is ironic considering he became a real president after all,Surprised
1252,Yeah... Many thought he was still acting.  It seems that Gal Gadot was a good actor and a former soldier in the IDF.,Angry
1252,Yeah and she did not wven know she was auditioning for wonder woman,Curious to dive deeper
1252,That's funny.  I hope she received payment.  Amazing how far DC to DCEU has come...,Surprised
1252,I bet she did. it was the highest grossing superhero origin movie,Surprised
1252,I don't think there's that kind of money in comic books unless you're someone like Stan Lee.,Angry
1252,Yeah for sure. and also it was the highest grossing WWI movie too,Curious to dive deeper
1252,I think I need to see it.  At least she didn't have audition problems like Reagan.,Angry
1252," that is true, I recommend you watch it. nice chatting with you",Happy
1253," hey there, do you like comic books?",Curious to dive deeper
1253," I did like them as a kid but not so much now, I guess they first got popular in the 1930s, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1253,Yeah they have been around for a long time. Do you know the name of the first modern comic relaased in 1933?,Curious to dive deeper
1253," nope didn't know that, I think they were originally just stuff that was printed in newspapers but eventually they became their own books as it were",Curious to dive deeper
1253,yeah the book was just a repritning of the newspaper. it was called Famous Funnies.,Surprised
1253,do you think its weird that Marvel had to explain to the US goverment about xmen? specifically that they were not actually real haha,Curious to dive deeper
1253,hahhaha but they made their point so well though.Did you know Stan Lee endded his phone calls with 'excelsior',Surprised
1253," haha that is awesome, I didn't know that gmail.com was originally used by the garfield website, google bought it directly from there",Surprised
1253,that is so cool. do you know which university has the largest collection of comic books?,Surprised
1253,haha I do because I live nearby! It's MSU and it is the largest public comic book collection in the world!,Happy

1253,Yeah some of his songs are really good. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
1253," ya I do like him, I can't believe he wanted to buy marvel comics and then use that deal to star as spiderman in a movie, that would have been wild!",Surprised
1253,Yeah that would have been. DO you watch much tv?,Curious to dive deeper
1253," can't say that I do no, I don't even have cable I watch a lot of Youtube though, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1253,I do watch it from time to time. How about movies and the theatre?,Surprised
1253,I do watch movies have you seen the Wonder Woman movie? It starred Gal Gadot and I thought it was OK,Curious to dive deeper
1253,I liked it and looking forward to the sequel.,Curious to dive deeper
1253," yes, I'll have to check out the lego movie, I guess that was the actual first movie to feature wonder woman",Surprised
1253,That is really interesting it was nice chatting with you,Happy
1254," Hello there, are you a fan of comic books?",Curious to dive deeper
1254," I am a fan of comic books specially Marvel, too bad Stan Lee died, did you know he ended every conversation with the phrase Excelsior",Sad
1254," Yeah that is sad to see him go, and no I didn't know that, very interesting. ",Curious to dive deeper
1254," Yeah apparently he did, I studied at Michigan State University and they have the largest comic book collection in the whole world.",Curious to dive deeper
1254," That is impressive, I wonder just how many total comics they have there.  Do you know what the DC in DC comics stands for?",Curious to dive deeper
1254," They must have thousands of comic books and no, what does it stand for?",Curious to dive deeper
1254," Yeah I'm sure it's a ton.  And I guess it stands for detective comics, so its detective comics comics lol. ",Curious to dive deeper
1254," I see thats interesting, so do you like DC comics or Marvel comics better?",Curious to dive deeper
1254,"  I think I would have to say Marvel, I grew up watching shows and reading those comics. How about yourself?",Curious to dive deeper
1254," I would have to say DC comics only because of Batman, I love Batman, its crazy how high the comic market is valued at the US and Canada.",Happy
1254," Yeah thinking about how much both franchises are worth is pretty crazy.  Speaking of Batman, who was your favorite actor to play him?",Curious to dive deeper
1254," Definitely Christian Bale, too bad he didnt make more movies, I thought he was just great.",Happy
1254,Yeah I thought he was great in those movies and I thought they were well done.  I would have to say Michael Keaton for me though.,Curious to dive deeper
1254," I see, he was a great batman as well, did you happen to watch the Wonder Woman movie, the latest one?",Happy
1254," No, but I really want to see it, I heard it was pretty good.  I also know it did really well at the box office. ",Curious to dive deeper
1254," I liked it, I thought it was pretty good, specially because the movie explained her past and how she came to be Wonder Woman.",Happy
1254,Yeah and I also heard that Gal Gadot was awesome.  I think there will be more Wonder Women films to come.,Curious to dive deeper
1254," There definetely will, there is a tough competition from Marvel although I like Marvel movies a lot more.",Happy
1254," Yeah there will always be competition, but I think sometimes that is a good thing. ",Curious to dive deeper
1254," Yeah, it definitely is a good thing, did you know Wonder Woman was made as the secretary of the group, kind of sexist.",Disgusted
1254," No I didn't know that, and yeah you can't get away with doing that these days, people are smarter.  Well it was nice talking with you today, I hope you have a good night. ",Happy
1255,Hello! How are you?,Curious to dive deeper
1255," Great! and you? Do you enjoy Poetry? For $9 is what Edgar Allan Poe got for , "" The Raven"".",Surprised
1255,I do like it sometimes haha how about you? That is sad he was only paid that!,Sad
1255,Did you know that the hobbits names were taken out of the old Icelandic poem called the Dvergatal? Kind of makes sense.,Surprised
1255,That makes total sense! The japanese people even made their alphabet into a poem when recited!,Curious to dive deeper
1255," Well, that's creative! I would like to see that. Poems are so interesting to hear!",Happy
1255,They really are! Even Demetri Martin wrote a 224 palindrome poem and he's a comedian!,Surprised
1255," Yes, all kinds of talent there! lol  Poets write in verse form and rhyme and focuses on the use of speech in drama, song and comedy!",Happy
1255,That is so cool! Do you like to read anything else beside poetry?,Surprised
1255,I love to read books and listen to audio books too! I love period pieces and history! and you?,Curious to dive deeper
1255,History is by far my favorite! Can you read as fast the record holder Anne Jones?,Surprised
1255,Omg no! How do you even do that? I have wonder if she has to understand whats she reading to win?,Surprised
1255,I don't even know how to measure that either but 4700 is both unbelievable and impressive haha.,Curious to dive deeper
1255," Very, Have you read Ender's game? I want to. Most military people have!",Curious to dive deeper
1255,Starship Troopers is another military must read haha. I haven't read either book!,Surprised
1255," Really, ok will put that on my list. Did you know Shakespeare and Pocahontas were alive at the same time and died only a year apart?",Curious to dive deeper
1255,I did not know that! I wonder if it was because of the moral panic due to the spread of reading novels haha.,Curious to dive deeper
1255,Isn't that crazy!! My goodness what were they afraid of? Isn't it funny how people thought then?,Surprised
1255,Maybe people being more educated? Who knows they were all weird back then lol. I had a great time chatting with you!,Curious to dive deeper
1255,You too! Have a great day!!,Happy
1255,Thanks!,Curious to dive deeper
1256,Hi. Are you a fan of Shakespeare? Did you know that he and Pocahontas were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.,Curious to dive deeper
1256,hi how are you? William! I dont know his works that well. That is funny that he was a contemporary of Pocanhontas.,Neutral
1256," He wrote 39 plays, 154 sonnets and two long narrative poems. He is probably most famous for Romeo and Juliet. ",Curious to dive deeper
1256,That story has been told and retold in so many ways. I figure it is an eternal tale that resonates in all cultures.,Neutral
1256,His plays have been translated into every major living language and his plays are performed more than any other playwright in history.,Surprised
1256,And the world should learn about him. few people ever write so well and so prolifically. i wonder what it was like to be around when he was alive.,Neutral
1256," Did you know he invented the names Miranda, Jessica and Olivia? He also invented a lot of the popular phrases we use today.",Curious to dive deeper
1256,He was a wordsmith of the highest order. I wonder how he got the talent. was his family good with words?,Neutral
1256," I can't say. Some people are just pure genius. So every time you say a phrase like Good riddance. Laughing Stock. Wild Goose Chase or As luck would have it, you can thank William Shakespeare. ",Happy
1256," Yes, he took english 1.0 and made it english 2.0. he set the stage for an expansion of the language unlike any other.",Neutral
1256,I am a fan of Shakespeare as you can tell but not as big a fan as other. Polish composer Andre Tchaikowsky donated his skull to the Royal Shakespeare company in hopes it would be used as a prop.,Surprised
1256,That is an odd donation. I guess he had the perfect skull for a prop? I wonder what the actors would think. LOL,Neutral
1256,They ended up using his skull in 2008 in a series of performance of Hamlet!,Surprised
1256,That is great! the best way to memorialized a man is to use his skull on stage.,Neutral
1256,Shakespeare isn't terribly easy to read. It takes on a different meaning if your accent is modern. It affects the rhymes and puns that don't work with modern pronunciation.,Neutral
1256," I struggled with it. the language is different, so different and used so exquisitely that i would need expert explanation to enjoy it.",Neutral
1256,Well a woman named Anne Jones could probably rip through it. She holds the world record for speed reading at 4700 words per minute.,Surprised
1256,I wonder how many books she reads a week. That is amazing! I could never do that and remember what i read.,Neutral
1256," I agree. If she read like that in the 18th century they would be outrages. There was a ""moral panic"" because of the spread of reading novels.",Neutral
1256," I stopped panicking about novels long ago, but i know the feeling. Novels??? Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
1256," Thank you, you too! I learned a lot of new and interesting things today. Keep learning!",Happy
1257,Hello! How are you?,Curious to dive deeper
1257,HI there.  YOu that interested in poetry?,Curious to dive deeper
1257,It's alright! I can't believe some it if from the 25th century BCE!,Curious to dive deeper
1257," Yes interesting.  Would have likedd to se lewis and tolkien in their ""you laugh you lose"" competions.",Happy
1257,I would have loved to see that go on! Can you believe Edgar Allen Poe only received 9 dollars for the raven?,Curious to dive deeper
1257,Wow.  That's a classic.  Think most everyone has heard of it.,Surprised
1257,What else do you like to read?,Curious to dive deeper
1257,I am a reader.  Mostly novels though.  Have read Shakespheare but found it difficult reading until you get started.,Neutral
1257,Me too! Did you hear about the moral panic caused by reading novels?,Curious to dive deeper
1257,No I hadn't.  What is it?,Curious to dive deeper
1257,In the 18th century there was a moral panic that was caused because of the spread of the reading of novels. Too funny!,Curious to dive deeper
1257,And today it's tough to get people off their phone devises to read!  LOL,Neutral
1257,I agree! Can you speed read at all?,Curious to dive deeper
1257,don't know about speed reading  Have tried techniques though by focusing on a finger down the middle of page.,Happy
1257," I dont understand it either. However, some girl read 4700 words a minute that way.",Curious to dive deeper
1257," That's crazy.  Wonder if she retained it.  I like Shakespeare's ""functional shift""  Like an attention check I guess!!",Curious to dive deeper
1257,Do you know how that works?,Curious to dive deeper
1257,He injected grammatical errors before key points in his plays.,Surprised
1257," That man is impressive haha. Anyways, had a great chat with you!",Curious to dive deeper
1257,Yes thank you.  Fun and interesting/  Have a great day!,Happy
1257,Thanks!,Curious to dive deeper
1258," hi, do you watch netflix?",Curious to dive deeper
1258,I do watch Neflix. I love to binge watch a good show.,Neutral
1258,nice. do you know how it started?,Curious to dive deeper
1258,I think it started during the decline of rental movie. Unfortunately for Blockbuster turned down a proposal from Netflix.,Neutral
1258,that was a bad decision on their behalf they must regret it,Curious to dive deeper
1258,That is what happens when you do not keep up with the changing and developing technologies. There are 137 million subscribers from around the world. A big loss for Blockbuster.,Neutral
1258,and they account for 33% of bandwidth in north america,Curious to dive deeper
1258," Yes, I would love to become a ""tagger"" and get paid to watch Netflix. ",Neutral
1258,I want to do that. and they still spend more on postage,Curious to dive deeper
1258,Do you remember when Google first launched in 1998. I only became aware of it in the year 2000 while in University.,Neutral
1258,that seems so long ago now. do you know how they calculate traffic?,Curious to dive deeper
1258,There is an algorithm that has changed many times over the years. Sometimes focusing on original content but now I believe it's focus is on personal history and preferences.,Neutral
1258,yeah they just track android decies on the road,Curious to dive deeper
1258," It is an interesting company. They have a strange almost frat house tradition for new employees.  They are called ""nooglers""",Neutral
1258," wow, and do you know how they mowed their lawn once?",Curious to dive deeper
1258,I have not heard about that story.,Neutral
1258,their hired hundreds of goats,Curious to dive deeper
1258,Well that is a way for them to have some fun. It is a very serious business but there is also something fun about how they use the new technologies.,Neutral
1258,yeah for sure.once it went down and took 40% of traffic with it,Curious to dive deeper
1258," Have you ever typed ""askew"" into the google start page. It makes the page tilted. ",Neutral
1258,No but I am going to try it. nice chat,Happy
1259,Hi. Do you like sharks? Did you know they involved earlier than dinosaurs and trees?!,Curious to dive deeper
1259," I have no real opinion one way or another concerning, sharks, other than that I want to avoid them in the wild.",Neutral
1259,I think it is fascinating that sharks will rescue sailors just as much as dolphins. They have such a bad reputation.,Surprised
1259," I think it depends on the shark.  A Great White might not be as friendly, especially in their cafe.",Surprised
1259,They can be trained like dogs to bark. That makes them seem a whole lot friendlier.,Surprised
1259," Do you watch documentaries on TV about sharks, I recall that Discovery Channel used to have a shark week?",Curious to dive deeper
1259," I love shark week! I just love learning fun facts about animals, like because sharks have no rib cages their weight can crush their own body on land.",Surprised
1259," There are a whole bunch of documentaries on Netflix, do you get to see those?",Curious to dive deeper
1259,Documentaries are some of my favorite things to watch. I google a lot of fun facts too. It is amazing to know that my google search takes more computing power than sending Neil Armstrong to the moon.,Surprised
1259," I know what you mean, I hear a small bit of information and then dive deeper by using Google.",Neutral
1259," It is fascinating that they have become such an authority. Even when there is a border dispute, Google maps will tailor it to the claims of each country where their browser is located.",Surprised
1259," Nothing like hedging your bets.  I used Google recently after seeing the movie Annihilation, I found out that the movie maker had made a previous film called Ex Machina.",Happy
1259,I love the answer is just waiting with a click of the button. I don't know what I would do without it anymore. When Google went down for 5 minutes in 2013 it took 40% of web traffic with it.,Surprised
1259," It seems to have been around forever, but I suppose it is relatively new.  Can't imagine what we'd do now if it went away.",Fearful
1259,I get so lost without Google Maps. Did you know they calculate traffic time by tracking how fast andriod devices are moving on the road?,Curious to dive deeper
1259," Sounds a bit like spying to me?  Technology gone too far.  Speaking of which, Google tells me that Alex Garland's Ex Machina is a story of technology gone too far.",Fearful
1259,Wow. Is it available on Netflix? I am always watching new films and I can see why Netflix and YouTube make up half of peak internet traffic in North America.,Curious to dive deeper
1259," Probably.  I cut my cable a couple of years back and now use Netflix.  Saves a fortune, and I'm not paying for things I don't want to watch.",Happy
1259,That is such a great way of saving. Well thanks for chatting. I learned a lot.,Happy
1259," Same here, just remember to enjoy sharks at a distance or on TV, not up close and personal.",Happy
1259,Haha. Great advice and I will let you know if I find any that can bark.,Happy
1260,I watch a lot of Netlfix. How about yourself?,Curious to dive deeper
1260,Hello - I also watch a lot of Netflix. I have a free account through T Mobile.,Happy
1260,Were you aware that they didn't start their streaming service until 2007? How far they have come!,Surprised
1260,Oh wow I didn't know that. Did you know Netflix has a movie that is an hour long about a fireplace for your home?,Surprised
1260,I have turned on the Yule log video at Christmas if that is what you are referring to. I'm also surprised that they didn't start making their own content until 2012. It seems like they have a new property every day now.,Surprised
1260,Did you know Netflix employs a team of taggers who are paid to watch Netflix and tag the content.,Curious to dive deeper
1260,I did not but I would absolutely love to have that job. I love Netlfix and I love organizing things. It seems like the dream job.,Happy
1260," In European markets, Netflix will monitor illegal downloads.",Surprised
1260,Wow! I honestly don't even know how one would perform illegal downloads from Netflix. Did you know that Blockbuster could have bought Netflix for $50 million and turned it down?,Curious to dive deeper
1260,I didn't know that! Netflix has almost 150 movies available with a 100% rating on rotten tomatoes.,Surprised
1260,That's amazing. I will have to look into those. Did you know what inspired Reed Hastings to start Netflix?,Curious to dive deeper
1260,I do not. What inspired him?,Curious to dive deeper
1260,He got a $40 late fee from a video store on a VHS copy of Apollo 13.,Neutral
1260,HAHA - that's crazy! Do you like Google?,Curious to dive deeper
1260,I use Google everyday.,Neutral
1260,Same here. Typing askew in Google will make the page titled....LOL,Surprised
1260,Oh wow. There are so many neat little hidden things on their home page. Did you know that Google once used hundreds of live goats to mow their lawns instead of hiring people?!,Surprised
1260,Definitely! Google's datacenter electricity is about .01% of total worldwide electricity use?,Surprised
1260,That seems like a lot when you are looking at it worldwide.,Neutral
1260,I agree. Do you like sharks?,Curious to dive deeper
1260,I find them to be fascinating.,Curious to dive deeper
1261,hey my friend do you have Netflix by chance?,Curious to dive deeper
1261," I  do, I have an account for over 2 years, do you subscribe to the service?",Curious to dive deeper
1261," no but my friend shares his with me, it's crazy it was founded back in 1997, did you hear the story behind it?",Curious to dive deeper
1261," No, I only subscribe but how did the company got created? that seems like a interesting fact",Curious to dive deeper
1261,ya the creator was mad because he got a $40 late fee for renting apollo 13 haha,Happy
1261," Yeah I can see why, $40 is an absurd ammount of money, ",Curious to dive deeper
1261," oh definitely, also absurd is that blockbuster had the chance to buy netflix back in the day",Surprised
1261," Yeah I bet they are also regretting the decision big time, Blockbuster is almost extinct by now.",Curious to dive deeper
1261,ya I think they're bankrupt right? Netflix went from 50 million to over 2 billion in worth!,Surprised
1261," That is a great jump, they are giants of the industy just like Google,",Curious to dive deeper
1261," oh definitely, they have about 140 million subscribers, with about 60 million in the USA alone",Surprised
1261,Sounds like a lot of money to me do you use Google a lot? I have the maps app and its a pretty good tool.,Curious to dive deeper
1261," oh ya I love Google, funny how they got started back in 1998 and that seems like so long ago",Surprised
1261," It does, well I'ts definitely a life changer as you can now use Google to get out of any trouble.",Curious to dive deeper
1261," oh for sure, they're so smart that they can calculate the traffic in an area by how fast android phones are moving",Surprised
1261," Yeah, and its actually pretty accurate as well, the importance of Google is big, it went down for 5 minutes back in 2013 and took 40% of the traffic with it",Curious to dive deeper
1261," wow that is crazy, I do think its funny how they change their border maps depending on which country the user is located in, in case there is a border dispute",Surprised
1261," That is amazing, so anyway, are you afraid of sharks?",Curious to dive deeper
1261," yes! I don't like sharks and spiders, did you know they evolved earlier than either trees or dinosaurs?",Surprised
1261," I didnt, they have been around a long time them, its crazy how their own weight in land can crush their bodies",Curious to dive deeper
1261," haha that is funny, also funny is that sharks can bark, nevermind that is kind of scary haha",Curious to dive deeper
1261,They can? I would piss my pants if that ever happened and im deep in the sea.,Happy
1262," Hello,  do you like Marvel Comics?  I am actually watching the Avengers right now lol Did you know Marvel created a super hero called blue ear that wore hearing aids?",Happy
1262," I am not a huge fan, but I heard that they did that for a little boy who also had to wear hearing aids. That's pretty great!",Surprised
1262," I know,  super considerate!  I believe there is also a super hero called Normal Man,  he lives in a city full of super heroes lol ",Neutral
1262," Haha. That's neat, too. Walt Disney owns Marvel now. They own a lot of things!",Happy
1262," Disney is amazing!  Yeah that is cool,  I always see a lot of Marvel Characters when I go to Disneyland,  They are coming out with a Star Wars land too ",Surprised
1262,Very cool! They don't have the right to show characters such as avengers and spiderman in theme parks in the East because of an old contract Marvel and Universal have,Surprised
1262," Yeah i did hear about that.  That is unfortunate,  I am sure thousands of people would want to take pics with those characters",Neutral
1262,I agree! Sony only bought the rights to Spiderman cause they thought no one would be interested in the other characters,Surprised
1262," lol Huge loss on their part now.  And cheap too,  $25 mil for all the characters,  that's nothing in the movie business.  ",Neutral
1262," Exactly, huge loss! There is one character that both Marvel and DC own",Surprised
1262," yeah,  I have never seen that character before lol It is really nice that a lot of the Marvel movies are available on netflix now! ",Neutral
1262,So many people use Netflix! I didn't realize they have been around since 1997!,Surprised
1262," Yes,  it is very convenient.  I can't believe that we use to go to the video store to rent movies or search through our movie library lol ",Neutral
1262,Seriously! Blockbuster could have bought Netflix for only $50million,Surprised
1262," yeah I know right what were they thinking,  and it's not like they only had one chance,  they had multiple offers lol ",Neutral
1262,Maybe they deserved to go out of business. Netflix is now worth $2 billion!,Surprised
1262," yeah,  they are long gone.  Oh well.  Netflix and Youtube make up half of the internet traffic in america lol ",Neutral
1262," That's amazing! Netflix has 137 million subscribers, though, so it makes sense. ",Surprised
1262," Have you seen Black Panther?  It is also on Netflix right now.  I guess Black Panther is the wealthiest super hero,  but it makes sense since he owns a country lol ",Neutral
1262,Wow! I haven't seen it. Bruce Wayne only has $80 billion compared to Black Panther's $500 billion.,Surprised
1262," yeah I know right,  mind blown!  lol its been good chatting. ",Neutral
1263,Hello did you know that netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in north america between the hours of 9pm-12am,Curious to dive deeper
1263," I'm not surprised! It's popular and streaming full movies and episodes will take up lots of bw. Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth, believe it or not.",Surprised
1263," Netflix was started by Reed Hastings, reed was once charged a $40 late fee on a VHS rental",Surprised
1263,He must have had that rental for a while. Blockbuster declined offers to buy netflix for $50m and now it's worth $2b!,Surprised
1263,Is block buster still around anywhere?,Happy
1263," I think in Alaska. The same thing happened with Facebook and Myspace. Youtube uses a lot of Bandwidth too, Netflix and YT make up half of internet traffic in North America.",Surprised
1263,I should have purchased netflix stock! They have 137 million subs as of 10-2018,Surprised
1263," Impressive! Have you seen the movie Black Panther, the 2018 American Superhero film based off the Marvel comic?",Curious to dive deeper
1263," Yeah, I did see it. It was...ok. I usually like marvel comic movies...this one seemed to be just ok",Surprised
1263," I haven't yet and probably won't haha. I didn't realize that the Black Panther is the richest superhero, estimated at $500 billion. Bruce Wayne is only $80 billion.",Surprised
1263," yeah, you're not missing a block buster there. Marvel started in 1939 as Timely Productions and by 1950 had become known as Atlas Comics.",Surprised
1263," I thought it was named after the Black Panther party, but apparently it's not. Marvel's use actually predates the founding of the party. They even changed their name to Black Leopard briefly to avoid confusion.",Surprised
1263,LOL! yeah it might as well have been. Evil whitey trying to take down Wakanda! The Marvel branding began in 1961 when they created The Fantastic Four.,Neutral
1263," Interesting! I didn't realize that it was a Disney film, either.",Surprised
1263," Marvel created a superhero for a 4 year old boy who wore a hearing aid because the boy said ""Superheroes dont wear hearing aids.",Surprised
1263,Blue Ear! I think that's amazing and something for the little boy to be proud of.,Surprised
1263," Yeah pretty cool. I wonder if China will ever let Netflix in? Only 4 courtiers do not allow access to Netflix, China, North Korea, Syria and Crimea.",Surprised
1263,Who knows! I'm sure Netflix doesn't really care since they have 137 million subscribers.,Neutral
1263,I'm sure they are trying to get in and bowing to whatever demand China is trying to impose on them,Curious to dive deeper
1263," Maybe. It'll probably never happen, especially in North Korea. It's in South Korea though.",Surprised
1263," I'm surprised people still order blu-ray and dvds via the postal service from Netflix, maybe people who live in the sticks with no internet.",Curious to dive deeper
1263," It's still a good option for people, like me who has a DVD player in my van! haha have a great weekend!",Happy
1263,Right on! hope you have a great view of the river from your van. Have a good weekend yourself.,Happy
1263,hahahahaha good one! RIP Farley,Happy
1264," Hello, do you have a netflix account?",Curious to dive deeper
1264," I don't anymore; I used to have one, but I spend more time watching YouTube.  How about you?",Neutral
1264," Ah I spend my time mostly watching youtube and amine ( yes, I am a weeb). Did you know that from 9 pm to 12 am, netflix accounts for 33% of all the bandwith in North America?",Curious to dive deeper
1264," I did not know that, but it makes sense.  Netflix in combo with YouTube make up about 50% of the Internet traffic in North America.  Those are huge entities.",Curious to dive deeper
1264,I wonder how much internet traffic google takes up. They probably take up most of it.,Surprised
1264,No kidding. Google is a monolith.  Things used to be easier when you could drive to the video store and rent a movie?  Did you ever rent movies from Blockbuster?  Do you remember VHS?,Curious to dive deeper
1264," Ah that brings me back. In fact, there was a blockbuster near where I live right now. The only remaining blockbusters are thriving in Alaska.",Happy
1264,Really?  I didn't know that either.  Do you remember the shame/guilt of returning a tape late?  At least I never had to pay too big of late fees.  The guy that started Netflix once paid 40 bucks for late Apollo 13.,Curious to dive deeper
1264," Wow 40 bucks, that is a lot now but it must have been a lot more back then. No wonder he wanted to start netflix!",Surprised
1264," No kidding!  That would make for an expensive movie night.  Speaking of, have you seen any good movies lately?  I've heard that Black Panther was pretty well done.",Curious to dive deeper
1264," Speaking of black panther, he is actually the richest superhero with a networth of 500billion!",Surprised
1264,Really!?  I would have thought it was Bruce Wayne?  Who knew that Black Panther could make Batman look poor?,Curious to dive deeper
1264," He also makes Tony Stark look poor, he is five times richer than him!",Surprised
1264," Tony Stark...now Iron Man, that was a good movie.  Marvel characters have had a strong run lately.  It's hard to believe that Sony once thought that audiences would only care about Spiderman.  He's one of my least favorite characters, actually.",Surprised
1264," Same, he does the least out of any character. Infinity War was an excellent movie! I cannot wait for endgame to come out",Curious to dive deeper
1264,Agreed!  Speaking of Marvel.  Who is your favorite villain?,Curious to dive deeper
1264," Ah, now that is a hard choice. It is probably Thanos because of all the memes  circulating him. 'Thanos Truck'",Happy
1264," Those are pretty cool.  Red Skull may not be my favorite, but he is scary.  That Super-Soldier Formula can be rough on a guy, apparently.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1264,Do you prefer marvel or DC comics? I prefer Marvel,Surprised
1264,I agree.  It's hard not to enjoy the work of Stan Lee.  That man was a genius.,Happy
1264," It was so sad that he died last year, him along with the creator of Sponge bob himself.",Sad
1264," Yes, that was a sad day.  It's hard to lose such creative minds; you know that their work can just never be replicated.  It's like losing a big part of the culture.",Sad
1264," I agree, for sponge bob was my CHILDHOOD. I loved that show so much while growing up, it was sad to see him die.",Sad
1265,Hi there! Are you a netflix user?,Curious to dive deeper
1265," Yes, I love Netflix! How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1265," I use it often, they appear to take up 33% of the bandwidth in North America during peak hours!",Curious to dive deeper
1265,From 9PM-12AM every night. What weird hours? I suppose most people can't stream shows during the day. Did you know Netflix and Youtube make up half of all internet traffic during that time?,Neutral
1265,Sounds about right. Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth too .Bandwidth is cheap!,Curious to dive deeper
1265,That's true! Why are they mailing so many things? I wonder if it's more secure than sending files through email!,Neutral
1265," They still send DVDs, and I'm sure promotions to people without current accounts.",Curious to dive deeper
1265," That's true. I forgot they still use DVDs. I don't even have a player anymore. Hey, do you like Marvel or superhero movies at all? I think Black Panther is on Netflix now.",Neutral
1265," I've seen Black Panther. Appaently the superhero in the movie is the richest of all the ""wealthy"" superheros at $500 billion",Curious to dive deeper
1265," I know. I was surprised to learn that Tony Stark was actually only worth $500 billion. But I guess it makes sense, Black Panther was the king of a whole country.",Neutral
1265,Selling an extremely rate/nonexisting anywhere else material too,Surprised
1265," Yeah, and his father was king so he probably comes from a long line of money. I thought it was cool that they used so many historical symbols and texts in the move, too.",Neutral
1265," Yea, was a great movie. Apparently Denzel washington sponsored chadwick bosement through a summer theatre program for that",Curious to dive deeper
1265," He sponsored Boseman about twenty years before making BP, then he got to thank him at the premiere!",Neutral
1265,Very nice gesture on both sides!,Happy
1265,Definitely. I was surprised to found out that the character Black Panther has been around longer than the political group.,Neutral
1265,I wonder if they took the name?,Curious to dive deeper
1265," I was wondering that, as well. Evidently, the character's name briefly changed to Black Leopard to avoid any confusion, but that doesn't have the same ring to it.",Neutral
1265," Na, doesnt fit with my memory of the movie and comic",Curious to dive deeper
1265," Definitely. Well, it's been nice talking to you today! Maybe I'll stream Black Panther on Netflix tonight.",Neutral
1265,You too!,Curious to dive deeper
1266,Do you enjoy traveling.  I would like to go to the Netherlands where the Dutch has a bus that can go 160 MPH.,Curious to dive deeper
1266," Yes, I would like to travel a lot more.  Travel is so easy and normalized now, there's even a website where you can find people that will let you stay at their house as you travel!",Surprised
1266,Yes.  Did you know the 1st king to travel around the world was king Kalakauua of Hawaii?  Hawaii has a king?,Curious to dive deeper
1266,Yeah.  Another piece of interesting history is that rabbits were once released on islands to provide future food sources for other other travelers.,Surprised
1266,That's thinking ahead... Better than leaving toll booths like Japan.,Surprised
1266,I believe travel is a great source of enrichment and education.  There is so much to talk about when one returns from travel.,Curious to dive deeper
1266," So, do you wear boots often.  Funny that Nokia go its start making rubber boots. ",Curious to dive deeper
1266," No, not often.  I am aware they have many uses though.  The military developed a boot that can be used in temperatures almost 60 degrees below zero.",Surprised
1266,Have you heard of Ugg boots?  I guess they were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after surfing.  I was surprised at how cold in water was in S. CA.,Curious to dive deeper
1266," Yeah, that is smart.  I would like to go hiking more, I haven't been in decades, and I know I will need boots for that.",Neutral
1266,Same here but I have my old boots... Maybe you can buy them from Apple if they start making clothing again like they did in 1986.,Curious to dive deeper
1266," Whatever boots I buy, it'd better not be made out of asbestos, the material the Greeks used to make clothing, because then I'd be paying for gold!",Neutral
1266,You might want to avoid Rip Curl.  They are N. Korean that falsely use China as a cover.  As if that's much better...,Surprised
1266,I am surprised that that an african tribe made the style of clothes of their former German occupiers their own style.,Surprised
1266,I'm surprised at how durable military clothing is and their wide use of wool.  One guy had a wool coat that weighed 8 pounds!,Surprised
1266,I wonder if any africans within that african tribe that was occupied by Germany dissented from wearing victorian clothes because they anyone who does as a traitor.,Curious to dive deeper
1266," Probably and payed a dear price.  I'm not a big shopper.  Maybe I should buy military coats because the last longer.  Actually, all military stuff does, even their buttons. ",Surprised
1266," Yeah, I imagine military clothing would be especially durable because they have to design it to withstand all kinds of conditions.",Neutral
1266,Yeah but I wonder if old soldiers can still fit in them.  I guess one soldier could as he wore the same shorts he did at his retirement ceremony some 50 years later.,Surprised
1266," I like the name the military gave to their special developed cold weather boots, ""bunny boots"", kind of a friendly and cute sounding name, for a group that is trained to kill.",Happy
1266,That does seem a little weird.  Thanks for the chat!,Surprised
1266," Yes, thank you too.  Have a good day!  Bye!",Happy
1267,It must be hard to have a husband or wife in the millitary!,Curious to dive deeper
1267,I know. I listen to a military podcast and you can hear the hurt in their voices. I love watching the military member come back to surprise their kids though...,Happy
1267," That is a really plesant surprise, old veteran clothes have a lot of millege and interesting stories behind them.",Curious to dive deeper
1267,I have a family friend who was in Vietnam. Love looking at his collection of medals.,Happy
1267," He must have some interesting war tales for sure, clothing can really tell a story sometimes.",Curious to dive deeper
1267,Yeah. I could not fit in a jacket from 20 years ago and Graff is fitting into his from 1945! WOw!,Surprised
1267," that is surprising indeed, you know Apple had a clothing line back in 1986",Surprised
1267,I did not. I wonder what a tech company's apperal looks like in 1986...,Curious to dive deeper
1267," Probably a tshirt with a big apple logo lol, its a good thing they changed industries and dedicated themselves to tech",Curious to dive deeper
1267,Yeah! Are you an Apple person?,Curious to dive deeper
1267," I have an IPhone and an IPad so I guess I am, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1267,I have that and a MacBook pro. I love Apple. I also own the stock but that has nothing to do with anything but capitalism; I also own Microsoft and they have performed better than Apple.,Happy
1267,Yeah I guess Apple products are a bit more exclusive and that can hurt sales do you like to travel much?,Curious to dive deeper
1267," I do like to travel, do you?",Curious to dive deeper
1267," Me too, I dont get to do it a lot but I like to travel, you know that Iceland has no public rail service, most Icelanders actually use domestic flights to travel to other towns.",Curious to dive deeper
1267,That seems terribly inefficient... I wonder why they chose to do that. I would love to go to iceland to see the northern lights...,Happy
1267," That would be interesting, Im thinking more of a local trip though, I heard Mackina Island is a good choice.",Curious to dive deeper
1267,I heard they do not allow cars. Do you think you would like living there?,Curious to dive deeper
1267," I think I would, it sounds like a relaxing place and with a cleaner air as well. It would be interesting to visit the island and just stay for a couple of days.",Curious to dive deeper
1267,I looked at a few homes for sale there and they have beautiful homes for sale. Like $3M homes!,Surprised
1267," Wow, thats sure is a lot of money, I cant afford that lol, a visit will have to do.",Curious to dive deeper
1268,Hi there are you a fan of fashion and clothing?,Curious to dive deeper
1268,Yes I love clothing! I'm wearing some right now haha. Did you hear about the pilgrims and what color their original clothing was,Curious to dive deeper
1268,haha me too!  I heard that they wore clothes that were full of color.  Surprised me because I always thought of them as wearing black and white.,Happy
1268,Yep I've only ever seen them in black-and-white haha. What about the Apple clothes that they made back in the 80s? Do you think those are colorful,Curious to dive deeper
1268,I've never seen those.  I wonder if they are valuable as a collectible now?,Happy
1268," They must be worth something! Did you hear about the store in Alabama? It sells clothes that were found in unclaimed baggage from airports, I would be mad to see some of my clothes in there LOL",Surprised
1268,lol  I bet they find some nice clothes to resell.  Sounds like a good business model.,Happy
1268,Yep they probably get some cool stuff in there. What do you think about the clothing brand Rip Curl? Apparently on their tags that says they are made in China but they are actually made in North Korea,Fearful
1268,Never heard of them.  I would be a little nervous quality wise and how they were mad.  Heard about slave factories in North Korea.  Do you have any boots?,Happy
1268,Yes I own boots. I just put them on because I had to shovel the driveway earlier LOL what about you,Curious to dive deeper
1268,oh man.  You live in the snow too.  I live in the snowbelt just south of Lake Erie. I have boots too and feel your pain.  The Nokia company originally by making rubber boots in the 1800's and they still make them to this day.,Happy
1268,Wow that is cool. I think it's interesting that the phrase pull oneself up by their bootstraps originally meant to do something impossible and not to just help yourself,Surprised
1268," That is interesting!  A man stopped to get his boots cleaned in Paris in 1938.  As a result of standing still for 7 minutes, both he and the cleaner became the first people in history to be photographed.  I've seen that photo before.  They didn't even know they were being photographed because they were part of a bigger picture of the neighborhood.",Happy
1268," That is really crazy what a lucky guy! It would be cool to be the first person to get a picture taken, what do you think about traveling by the way? I just got back from Florida myself",Curious to dive deeper
1268,I love traveling!  The Dutch are creating a commuter bus designed to travel at 160mph!  I would travel more regionally if I could take that and get where I was going safely.,Happy
1268," Yep that sounds awesome! It sure beats going through airport security, I would love to take that bus around Japan though too, except all of their highways are toll roads",Surprised
1268,That would be expensive!  I want to go to Mackinac Island in Michigan where they banned all motorized vehicles for over 100 years.  Sounds like a relaxing place.,Happy
1268," I've been there, it's not cool in my opinion, you have to take a horse everywhere and I'm allergic to horses so it was horrible for me LOL",Disgusted
1268,oh man.  lol that would be terrible.  I didn't think of that.  The first king to travel around the world was King KalaKaua of Hawaii.  I bet the saw some amazing things.,Happy
1268,Yeah I bet he was very interested in that. What do you think about Japan though? Would you ever go? I would hate to spend $300 to travel across the whole country,Sad
1268," I would love to go there.  But, ouch that would be pretty pricey.  It's been a pleasure chatting with you!",Happy
1269," Hi there, do you have items of clothing that are your favorite?",Curious to dive deeper
1269," Hi there, I sure do. I love my flats in the summer an d the uggs in the winter",Curious to dive deeper
1269,Nice. Pilgrims love colorful clothing and only wear black in special occassions,Curious to dive deeper
1269,That is neat Uggs were invented for surfers to keep their feet warm afert they get out of the ocean,Curious to dive deeper
1269,Oh that is cool. THere is a store in Alabama where you can buy stuff that was left at airports,Curious to dive deeper
1269,Oh cool they must have all sorts of things in there then. Do you know how the first photo was taken and of whom,Curious to dive deeper
1269," Hmm I am not aware of that actually, would you mind sharing, I am curious?",Curious to dive deeper
1269," Sure, a guy stopped in a street in Paris to clean his boots and him and the guy who cleaned them were there for 7 minutes and someone took the picture",Curious to dive deeper
1269,Oh that is a neat story. Do you know how people who are in fashion can tell if you need to tailor your clothes?,Curious to dive deeper
1269,Hmm interesting one but I do not know that. Do you know what pulling yourself by the bootstrap used to mean?,Curious to dive deeper
1269,I do not know that actually. But for tailoring they look for collar gaps on the clothes,Curious to dive deeper
1269,Oh interesting. Apple used to have a clothing line but not sure what happened to it.,Curious to dive deeper
1269," Yeah that is pretty cool. North Korea has a brand but it says Made in China, go figure",Curious to dive deeper
1269,Hhahaha that is too funny. Do you travel much?,Curious to dive deeper
1269,I do as much as I can. Have you ever been to Japan?,Curious to dive deeper
1269,I have not but I hear it cost a lot to travel by car because the highways are tolled,Curious to dive deeper
1269,Yesh it would cost you about $300 but I guess that money is used well as their roads are great,Curious to dive deeper
1269,Yeah that is justified I guess. The Dutch are creating a bus that goes 160 mph,Curious to dive deeper
1269,I would like to try that. In Iceland there is no railway so you have to travel by plane or a car,Curious to dive deeper
1269,It is a rough terrain so I can see it being costly to build a railway there,Curious to dive deeper
1269,Exactly. How fun to take super short plane trips from town to town,Happy
1270,Do you read comics?,Curious to dive deeper
1270,I don't read comics but I have seen some of the movies and TV shows.,Neutral
1270,Which would you say is your favorite movie or tv show?,Curious to dive deeper
1270,Who is the  blind guy on netflix. I think it starts with a D,Neutral
1270,I can't think of the name. Marvel is a pretty popular company among fans.,Neutral
1270,Yes. Do you watch Netflix? Did you know that they started their own content in 2012?,Curious to dive deeper
1270,I am a huge Netflix fan!,Neutral
1270,Have you seen the fireplace movie? It is an hour long. I heard that it is popular in apartments in NYC.,Curious to dive deeper
1270,I have not. I enjoy the series Luther and MindHunter,Happy
1270,I have seen part of Luther. Fun! Did you know that Netflix has 150 movies with 100% ratings on Rotten Tomatoes?,Curious to dive deeper
1270,DId any of the Netflix show win a Golden Globe last night?,Curious to dive deeper
1270,I know that there were several nominated. I love the Marvelous Mrs. Maizel. Can you believe that people just tag content on Netflix? What a job!,Happy
1270,What is that about?,Curious to dive deeper
1270," While watching a movie you can click and see who the actors are, etc. so I guess people are paid to tag the content. ",Neutral
1270,Netflix traffic spikes around 9 PM every night,Neutral
1270,interesting. I also find it funny that Netflix tried to get a deal with Blockbuster as their online provider and Blockbuster didn't take the chance. Their loss!,Surprised
1270,Yeah that was certainly a bad business decision. Now look where they are at.,Neutral
1270,I also read that Michael Jackson tried to buy Marvel comics so that he could play Spiderman. So happy that didn't happen!,Curious to dive deeper
1270,I think that would have been a bad idea.,Neutral
1270," Comics, I guess, began in the 1930s but then were branded in 1961.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1270,Time for some Netflix. Gonna check out that show.,Neutral
1271,hi how are you? do you watch netflix?,Neutral
1271," Hi! Yes, I love Netflix. In fact, I'm proud to say I'm one of the reasons Netflix accounts for 33% of all the North American bandwidth from 9pm to 12am. How about you?",Happy
1271,I used to be part of that bandwidth too. i dont use netflix now. it takes up too much of my time.,Neutral
1271," Lucky you! Ha! I'm addicted to both YouTube and Netflix and again, I'm one of the reasons they both account for half the peak internet traffic in north America. Ha!",Neutral
1271," Yeah, the bandwidth usage is just going to go up. People want that video entertainment.",Neutral
1271,Indeed! But it's crazy that Netflix actually spends 20 times more on postage than on bandwidth! I find that hard to believe!,Surprised
1271,I guess some people dont live in areas with enough bandwidth. they need the post.,Neutral
1271,Yeah that could be why. But just think where we'd be today if Blockbuster hadn't rejected an offer to buy Netflix for $50 million. That was a huge mistake on their part considering Netflix is now worth $2 billion.,Neutral
1271," Yeah, i would have made the same mistake. i would not have expected netflix to become netflix.",Neutral
1271," I don't think I would have either. We all have Reed Hastings to thank for letting a late fee on a VHS copy of Apollo 13 accumulate to $40, inspiring him to create Netflix!",Neutral
1271," Yes, netflix did not charge late fees and people loved it. it worked out great, but not for BB.",Neutral
1271," It did work out great as now the company has 137 million subscribers worldwide in every country except mainland China, Crimea, North Korea and Syria!",Neutral
1271," Yeah, netflix is a force to reckoned with, but one day netflix might encounter a competitor that unseats them.",Neutral
1271," That is true. I just hope the competitor let's us watch comic book movies. Ha! Speaking of comic books, did you know Stan Lee ends every phone call with the word ""excelsior""? That's hilarious!",Neutral
1271," He was legend, that Stan Lee was. What does that word even mean though? ",Neutral
1271,I'm sure we could find out by visiting the library at Michigan State University as it contains the biggest comic book collection available to the public in the world! That is amazing!,Happy
1271,That is great! im glad that there is a school out there dedicated to comics. they are an important art form.,Neutral
1271,Indeed they are. Are you also familiar with DC Comics? It's crazy as it stands for Detective Comics which is a redundant company name!,Surprised
1271," Yeah, a silly name. i prefer marvel. i like spider man. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
1271," I love Marvel as well! I became a fan after hearing about the Blue Ear superhero they created for the 4 year old who was uncomfortable wearing hearing aids. He once told his mom ""superheroes don't wear hearing aids"" and Marvel created the hero for him. That was so sweet if them. Well it was great chatting with you as well! ",Happy
1271,That was kind of them. Have a good weekend.,Neutral
1271," Indeed! It was very kind! I also think it's cool Access is owned by both DC and Marvel simply to try and keep both companies' universes separate! That is awesome! Ha! Well, you have a good weekend as well! Take care, friend!",Neutral
1271,That is funny! Bye!,Neutral
1271,Take care! I'm off to read The Fantastic Four which was launched the same year (1961) the Marvel branding began! Have a great evening!,Neutral
1272,Hi. Do you watch Netflix?,Curious to dive deeper
1272," Yes, I do watch Netflix! I haven't seen Iron Fist? have you?",Curious to dive deeper
1272," No, I haven't either. Are you into superheros?",Curious to dive deeper
1272," Yes, I love Batman and Cat woman!!  I see Wonder Woman is up for awards!!",Curious to dive deeper
1272,That's great! Marvel has become such a huge company. Even more so now that they are owned by Disney.,Surprised
1272," I agree, that was something when Disney did that! But Disney doesn't own rights to Big, Avengers , Xmen, Spiderman etc!",Curious to dive deeper
1272," I heard they own the rights, they just aren't able to use the characters at certain theme parks due to an old agreement. Marvel has been around since 1939, although it had another name back then. ",Neutral
1272," Yes, in theme parks. Did you know there is a superhero called Blue ear? Marvel created it for a 4 year old boy who wore a hearing aid! Very cool.",Happy
1272,That's awesome!There is actually a superhero owned by both Marvel and DC Comics.,Surprised
1272,Named Access. Blockbuster made the mistake on declining the offer to buy Netflix!,Surprised
1272," That's for sure, they could have bought it for only 50 million!",Surprised
1272," How about Reed Hastings getting upset over a $40 fee on his VHS, so he started Netflix! lol",Surprised
1272,Good for him! Now he has 137 million people paying him!,Surprised
1272," Ha, ha, ha, I know!! Its believable that in peak internet traffic its Utube and Netflix being used.",Neutral
1272," Definitely! and that at nighttime, netflix itself takes up 1/3 of bandwidth in North America!",Surprised
1272,Yeah! I have Netflix and few others but I would say I use Youtube alot!!,Neutral
1272,I can't believe Netflix has been around for over 20 years. It started way back in 1997.,Surprised
1272," I know, It doesn't seem that long. Netflix announced it would get another 2 Billion in debt to help fund new content!",Curious to dive deeper
1272," Really?! They have been making their own content since 2012, so I am surprised they are not making huge profits",Surprised
1272,Did you know that MS University library has the largest comic book collection in the world!!,Surprised
1272," I didn't know that. I'm sure that's neat to see. I learned a lot, Nice chatting with you!",Surprised
1273,Are you a marvel fan?,Surprised
1273," Hi, I really like the movies.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1273,I am more into netflix shows.  Have you you seen Iron Fist?,Surprised
1273," I have not, but it sounds like an exciting show!",Happy
1273," The first season was OK, but the second season has a new main person. ",Surprised
1273," Yes, Colleen Wing.  Do you like her character?",Curious to dive deeper
1273,At least she is Asian which the character is supposed to be.,Surprised
1273," Yeah, it's a nice twist to put a female asian in the lead role.  Did you know that Stan Lee ended every phone conversation with Excelsior!""?",Curious to dive deeper
1273," No, I did not know that. Another major revelation is she may be the descendant of Wu Ao-Shi, the first female Iron Fist.",Surprised
1273," Yeah, that's very exciting!  And a nice twist!",Surprised
1273," Yeah, it makes the whole series come together.",Surprised
1273," Very cool.  Apparently Marvel trademarked the names ""super-hero"" and ""super-villain"".  I guess those words didn't need to exist before!",Curious to dive deeper
1273,If they made them then I am fine with that. Did you know netflix was founded because one of the founders got late fees on a rental?,Surprised
1273,That is curious!  Imagine creating a multi-billion dollar company just because of late fees!  I can't believe that Netflix pays more in postage than in broadband.  Who are they mailing stuff to?,Curious to dive deeper
1273,Some people get movies sent to them.  I did that when they first started. Do you like comic books?,Surprised
1273," Do they still mail movies to people?  I thought they stopped that.  I am not really into comic books, I like the movies because of the humor they put in there.  Do you like comic books?",Curious to dive deeper
1273,They might not anymore.  Maybe it's now advertising? I like american comics.  Do you like marvel or DC more?,Surprised
1273," I don't have a preference, I think I like them both equally.  Is that ok to do?  Like I said, all I know is from the movies.  I really liked the X-Men series when they were out.",Curious to dive deeper
1273,I really like superman and batman the most.,Surprised
1273,Oh nice choice.  I like the batman lego game.  Can you believe that Netflix and YouTube make up half of the peak internet traffice in the states?,Curious to dive deeper
1273,Yes I can believe that.  I constantly use them.,Surprised
1273," Lol!  I use Netflix, not YouTube.  So are superman and batman DC?",Neutral
1273,It has been nice chatting with you.,Surprised
1274,Hey there. I have never had shark fin soup. Good thing!,Curious to dive deeper
1274,I hear its tasty and a lot of people actually like it,Curious to dive deeper
1274," Yeah, I guess that the consumption has been declining since 2011. It had become very popular at events and weddings as a very expensive dish to serve.",Curious to dive deeper
1274," I am worried about sharks and the extinction they face. It's very expensive and thats why pirates, fishermen ignore the laws",Curious to dive deeper
1274," Yea, I agree with you. It is a cause for concern. I had also heard that the soup can be tasteless.",Curious to dive deeper
1274,A good thing is that consumption has fallen 80% since the public awareness campaign in the country,Curious to dive deeper
1274," Yeah, that's amazing. The group WildAid estimated that a quarter of shark and ray species are threatened with extinction.",Curious to dive deeper
1274," Thats sad, the stats are still alarming, 100 million sharks get killed every year, ",Sad
1274," Oh wow, That is really sad and concerning too. I read that sharks have no rib cage. Did you know that?",Curious to dive deeper
1274,Yeah and 73 million parts end in soup. No I didn't know that,Curious to dive deeper
1274," Eeeew, gross! Yeah, a shark will crush itself if it were ever on land because of its weight and no rib cage.",Curious to dive deeper
1274,Fun fact but more people get bitten by New Yorkers each year than by sharks,Curious to dive deeper
1274," HA, yikes, that is good to know , i think? lol",Surprised
1274," You should beware of New Yorkers when you go there lol, sharks are also ticklish, thats funny",Curious to dive deeper
1274," Ha, yeah. I knew that dolphins had been known to save sailors at sea but sharks have also been known for that also. They can be trained as well as a dog can be trained. I just don't want to be the trainer because my dog doesn't listen. ",Curious to dive deeper
1274," I would freak out if I watched a shark swim towards me lol, and I guess that's nice, training sharks, saving people",Curious to dive deeper
1274," Yeah, reminds me of the scary movie Jaws. As far as saving wildlife goes the Norwegian government donated 1 billion dollars to save the Amazon in 2008. That's impressive.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1274," No, that was a scary movie, and I agree, that is impressive",Curious to dive deeper
1274," HA, Germany became the first country to give animals legal rights. I wonder if America ever will?",Curious to dive deeper
1274," I think we should many people treat animals poorly,there is a lawyer that represents animals in court",Curious to dive deeper
1274," Yeah, that would make a good tv reality show. The study of animals is called zoology so maybe that can be part of the tv show name? Ya know the Loch Ness Monster was given protected species status in 1912, so we have come pretty far with jokes.",Happy
1274," Nessie deserves rights too I guess lol, ",Curious to dive deeper
1275,Hey have you ever gone on a travel trip outside of the United States? Apparently power differences is a real concern when you bring your electronics,Curious to dive deeper
1275,Oh yeah - trying to figure out what power adapter to use was a nightmare!  Every country is different!,Neutral
1275," Yep that seems really annoying, and there's so many adapters that you would need depending on which country you are in, that's why I don't like to travel haha",Fearful
1275,The key is understanding that Europe runs on 220v and we run on 110.  Many devices can actually do both.,Neutral
1275," Well I need to look into that if I ever do travel, or at least just use the hotel electronics that come with the hotel stay",Surprised
1275,Yes I am a big fan of travel - even if airlines has slowed flights down by 10% since the 60s to save fuel,Neutral
1275," Yes that seems annoying. Maybe I will try traveling on that Dutch Bus though, they're making it go a hundred sixty miles per hour which is crazy",Surprised
1275,That would be a lot of fun!  Ride buses and couch surf while you are there,Neutral
1275," Yep that's the plan! I also want to go to Japan someday, have you ever been there? Apparently all of their highways are tolls",Curious to dive deeper
1275,Yes and expensive ones at that!  $300 to cross the country!,Neutral
1275," That is really expensive! Also expensive is traveling on Mackinac Island, they don't allow cars and so you need to operate a horse if you want to travel anywhere",Surprised
1275,Yes I like horses.  Did you know that years ago ships would release rabbits onto islands to provide food for future travelers?  Rabbits do like to breed!,Neutral
1275," That is a good idea! That way if you ever traveled to that Island again you would have some food, but if you're a rabbit that sounds like it would be a horror movie LOL what do you think about horror movies by the way",Surprised
1275,I like the rocky horror picture show - it is a great classic flick,Neutral
1275," Yeah that is a great movie, I also like the movie Bambi even though I don't consider to be a horror movie like Stephen King does",Surprised
1275,laugh yeah bambi is not a horror movie.  It is funny ET was originally scripted to be a horror film!,Curious to dive deeper
1275," That is funny! I need to watch more horror movies though, you can burn 200 calories just from seeing one, and I need to lose weight haha",Surprised
1275,Ok I know what I need to binge watch now!   I think its funny that there was not anyone involved in the filming of the original Exorcist movie who thought it was going to turn out to be a horror film.,Neutral
1275," That is funny, it's kind of like the boy from The Shining, he didn't realize that they were making a horror movie until he saw the actual movie years later when he was an adult",Surprised
1275,Yes they did not want to scare him!  Inception was originally going to be a horror film not a thief story,Neutral
1275," Yeah I didn't know that, have you ever heard of the instrument called a waterphone by the way? It's the instrument that makes that creepy sound in movie trailers, like a metallic sound almost",Surprised
1276," Hi, how are you?",Happy
1276,I'm just getting back from vacation. None of my electronics worked because I didn't have a converter. I'm considering buying the Tumi model for $50 because it works in 150 countries.,Curious to dive deeper
1276," Do you travel a lot? If so, it sounds like it would be worth the investment...",Happy
1276,I travel occasionally but have never had this issue so I want to be sure I get the best item. I'm also considering the Twist World Adapter for $37 because it proves for three devices at a time.,Curious to dive deeper
1276,I do not travel internationally so I am not sure. I do know I would be pretty embarrassed if I shut down the power to half my hotel...,Fearful
1276,So true! I enjoy travelling by car and train. I hate boats and planes because I get motion sickness. How about you?,Happy
1276,I hate planes. I fly a few times a year but I hate the turbulence. Where is the best place you've visited?,Happy
1276," I love Bangor, ME where stephen king lives. He was inspired to get into the horror genre after seeing disney's Bambi. So weird!",Happy
1276,Iceland has no public rail service and that most icelanders without cars use domestic flights to travel between major towns.,Surprised
1276,I can't even imagine using airplanes as a substantial mode of transportation! I prefer places like Mackinac Island where there are no vehicles at all.,Happy
1276," That's really interesting. Optimus prime has died more than 25 times in the last 30 years across comics, cartoons, movies, and video-games. it has become a running joke among transformer fans.",Surprised
1276," I'm not surprised they would have such a hole in their storyline, given that they have such low rotten tomatoes scores of 15% and 32%.",Disgusted
1276,Did you know that off the top of your head? The Rotten tomatoes scores...,Happy
1276,I follow rotten tomatoes closely. I never see a movie without checking it first. I find it to be very reliable.,Happy
1276,Nice. Do you see movies often?,Curious to dive deeper
1276,I go about once a month. I like movies like transformers for the CGI effects. It took 38 hours for one frame of movement. That's dedication!,Surprised
1276," Wow. Thats cool. Danny, the boy from the shining, did not know he was acting in a horror film until several years later.",Surprised
1276,That movie is scary. It makes my heart race. You can burn hundreds of calories scared watching horror films.,Fearful
1276," If you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art, you will enjoy the art more",Surprised
1276,I'll have to try that!,Happy
1276,nice chatting with you,Happy
1277," Hello,You know I was just thinking about different cultures and how the food preferences differ so much between them.",Curious to dive deeper
1277," Yes, like people eating shark in Asia.",Surprised
1277,Ive heard that it is a tradition to eat shark fin at celebrations in parts of Asia.This has had an effect on shark populations.,Disgusted
1277," Yes, there are concerns that it may cause shark to become extinct. Mainland China seems to have been doing a good job of turning away from this practice.",Curious to dive deeper
1277,At least the consumption of shark fin soup has been reduced by 80 percent in China.Its a shame to put an entire species at risk because of a food trend.,Surprised
1277," They seem to be eating more in Thailand, Hong Kong and Macau despite it being unhealthy ",Curious to dive deeper
1277,There are other countries that exploit the shark for meat as well.There are estimated to be 20 million blue sharks killed a year.At that rate it wouldnt take long to destroy the entire population.How sad.,Sad
1277," Yes, and the fact that it is basically string cartilage laced with  mercury is definitely a reason to avoid it.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1277,I agree it isnt the healthiest fish to consume.Sharks are amazing creatures.They actually evolved before dinosaurs or trees,Disgusted
1277," Yeah, while we're on facts...did you know that there are more people bit by New Yorkers than sharks every year!",Surprised
1277,Thats an interesting and funny fact.Ive also heard that sharks have been known to rescue sailors as dolphins do.I couldnt imagine being rescued by a shark.,Happy
1277," Well, if I would be rescued by a shark I would surely tickle him! Each one of them have their own personality and there is even a community in Indonesia that keeps them as pets!",Curious to dive deeper
1277,Sharks are a social sort of creature.There is a place in the Pacific Ocean called the white shark cafe.Sharks come to this place to congregate.,Curious to dive deeper
1277,Sounds beautiful! I wonder if they have their own language as do many animals around the world. Animals from different areas even have different dialects!,Curious to dive deeper
1277,I didnt know that.I find animals interesting.There are about 20 quintillion individual animals in the world.,Surprised
1277,They have special bridges in the Netherlands for animals to cross safely from one area to another.,Curious to dive deeper
1277,Thats very considerate in The Netherlands.In Germany animals have constitutional rights,Happy
1277,Wonderful! They have a lawyer in Switzerland that represents animals.,Curious to dive deeper
1277,In Scotland the Loch Ness Monster is a protected species,Surprised
1277," Ha! Bigfoot too? So, there are a few biologically immortal animals out there. Do you know about them?",Curious to dive deeper
1277,What are the biologically immortal animals.Turtles and elephants maybe?,Curious to dive deeper
1277,Close...jellyfish and lobster,Curious to dive deeper
1277,Why are these animals considered biologically immortal?,Curious to dive deeper
1277,Theoretically they can live forever!,Curious to dive deeper
1277,That is amazing.Did you know that hiccups are a holdover from evolution when animals had gills and lungs?,Surprised
1277," YES!!! I had heard that before!! So wild! And did you know that just like we have a dominant hand like left and right, animals have a dominant paw.",Curious to dive deeper
1277,I never though about animals having a dominant paw.That is an interesting fact.,Surprised
1277,Want some government facts? The Chinese government censored the word censorship!,Curious to dive deeper
1277,What was the Chinese governments reasoning behind the censorship?,Curious to dive deeper
1277,It's a communist country. They don't want anyone to use words like censorship that would make them look bad. Our own government has shut down 17 times in the past 37 years.,Surprised
1277,Did you know that Wikileaks published the governments plan to destroy them?,Surprised
1277,Or that JP Morgan bailed out the government in 1895...that would be a risky endeavor,Surprised
1277,I knew about JP Morgan.I guess it was in his own self interest to help the US.Did you know that 86 percent of Nevada is government owned?,Curious to dive deeper
1277,Get out! Like government installations? The US publishes the names of anyone who renounces citizenship. I've never seen that list before!,Surprised
1277,Ive never heard of such a list either.I wonder if you are allowed to change your mind and get off the list?,Surprised
1277," That would be good to know. Although you would have to be pretty serious to want to go through with renouncing your citizenship in the first place. So, maybe they went to Monaco. Monaco got rid of income taxes because the casinos pulled in enough revenue",Curious to dive deeper
1277,Im sure the standard of living in Monaco is one of the highest in the world.I wonder what happens to the revenue generated in Las Vegas if the government owns the state.,Curious to dive deeper
1277,Ha! That would be good to know!,Curious to dive deeper
1277,Governments can be good for some things.The Norwegian government donated 1 billion to save the amazon rainforest.,Happy
1277,That's fantastic!,Curious to dive deeper
1277,The rain forest needs all the help it can get.,Sad
1277,Speaking of saving animals and the environment. The NBA player Yao Ming helped in educating the people of China about their shark eating habits.,Surprised
1277,I guess the shark owes a debt of gratitude to the celebrities of China for reducing their consumption.,Happy
1277,And the conservation group WildAID.,Curious to dive deeper
1277,Im glad some one is looking out for the sharks protection,Happy
1278,Do you like to travel?  The Dutch are making it easier with a bus that can do 160mph.,Curious to dive deeper
1278,That is interesting. and It cost a lot to travel in Japan,Neutral
1278," Many yen huh?  I wonder about Iceland.  They have no public rail service, no cars -- only horse-drawn carts or bikes.  Plus one has to dodge volcanos. ",Surprised
1278,I would love to live there. I love to fly,Happy
1278,Better pack a coat... Did ya know that the first king to travel the world was a Hawaiian named King Kalakaua.,Angry
1278,I wonder how long it took King Kalakaua to travel around the world,Curious to dive deeper
1278," I have no idea.  If it's one of those canoe things, I'm guessing quite a while... Do you like horror films?",Curious to dive deeper
1278,I love them. I also love to burn calories while looking at them. Do you like them ?,Curious to dive deeper
1278,Not really -- only if there is a cute girl latching on to me... Can you beleive Stephen King was once afraid of Bambi?,Curious to dive deeper
1278,that is too funny. I learned that the music is played using a waterphone,Curious to dive deeper
1278," I don't even know what a waterphone is.  I did learn that Edgar Allen Poe is considered ""horror"".  I remember the ""Tell Tale Heart.""",Surprised
1278,I loved his books and it funny how modern horror is inspired by him,Neutral
1278," Yeah, its too bad he died so young.  Love him... Ii wonder if people would read him and then go to a modern art museum ",Curious to dive deeper
1278,Are you a transformers fan ? This is a billion dollar franchise,Neutral
1278," It was a little before my time.  I'm more of the ""Tonka"" generation. ",Angry
1278,I am the transformers generation from the 80's. I collected the toys but did not see the movies,Neutral
1278,That's too bad... Their cgi effects are good and they take the time to do it right.  Up to 38 hours a frame.,Surprised
1278,Optimus prime keeps duing but is always in another movie. How does this work lol,Curious to dive deeper
1278," Dunno.  There is no shortage of explosions, that's for sure. It's been nice chatting with you!",Angry
1278,Nice chatting with you as well. Hope to meet you again,Happy
1278,Me too.,Angry
1279," Hi, how are you?",Happy
1279,Hello I am good. Do you have any interests like Horror films or other movies like action films?,Neutral
1279,I get too scared and so I do not watch them. Do you like to watch them?,Curious to dive deeper
1279,Not too much really although I like the trivia I have read about movies even horror movies. Like the creepy sounds they use in those film are mostly metallic noises from a waterphone instrument. Crazy huh?,Neutral
1279,Or that the dutch are creating a commuter bus designed to go 160!,Happy
1279,That is something pretty amazing. I wonder what kind of fuel that bus uses or if it is just regular gas. Travel is so different in so many countries. I mean people have to use domestic flights to travel between major towns if they don't have a car.,Neutral
1279,Japan highways are tolls. Seems like a really expensive way to travel there.,Surprised
1279,That does sound expensive. I once read in a travel book it costs like more than $300 to travel across the country. Must be very expensive for it's residents.,Neutral
1279,Im from Illinois and it feels like that's what we pay sometimes. Such a pain.,Disgusted
1279,I have never had to pay a toll so I guess I am lucky. Movies are expensive as well besides travel. I mean they spend billions of dollars on them sometimes and make even more billions back like the transformers movies.,Neutral
1279,They got a 15 from rotten tomatoes though. So they may spend and make the money back but it may not be good.,Surprised
1279," True, the ratings have done way down on them. I mean when a character like Optimus Prime has died more than 25 times in story universe that expands books, comics, shows, and movies it is hard to take it seriously or think it has quality",Neutral
1279," As long as the fans think it is ok, I guess it is fine but you're right. Seems t be a joke. I used to love the transformers. ",Happy
1279,I used to as well. I think Michael Bay is just too caught up in himself. I mean he even had himself be one of the humans megatron flicked away in the first film.,Neutral
1279," There are 1.53 explosions per minute in the 2007 film. He likes big explosions, I guess.",Surprised
1279,He also loves the CGi a little too much. I know one of the effects in the transformers movie was so difficult that it took 38 hours to just render one movement. It's insane.,Neutral
1279,Seems like a lot of work for one movement. He has to love his craft! Have you ever been on the Transformers ride at Universal Studios?,Curious to dive deeper
1279,No I haven't but I want to go there. I love action movies and I know they have a lot of rides there,Neutral
1279,I loved the Harry Potter and Simpsons stuff there. I went like 3 years ago and want to go back.,Happy
1279,I am surprised with how popular horror movies are that there isn't a theme park for that kind of genre.,Neutral
1279,There might be in a small town in georgia or something. Nich chatting with you!,Happy
1280,I adore horror movies. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
1280,Yes I like horror movies too. You know that Stephen King considers Bambi to be a horror movie?,Surprised
1280,I can imagine how it would be quite traumatic as a child. A lot of the old Disney movies are rough. Do you like Stephen King? I love him.,Curious to dive deeper
1280," I think he has a lot of good work that he put together, he's very influential in the horror genre, did you know that you can burn almost 200 calories from watching a horror movie",Surprised
1280,I had no idea. I must burn a lot of calories ha ha. Did you know that the boy that played Danny in The Shining had no idea he was in a horror movie?,Curious to dive deeper
1280," No but that's a good thing! I'm glad he didn't know because he would be really very messed up, it's good that he saw it several years later once he was older",Happy
1280,I agree. That movie is very intense especially for someone that young.,Neutral
1280," Yep for sure, have you ever heard of the water phone by the way? It's a special type of instrument that makes that metallic sound that scares people in horror movies",Surprised
1280,I have not but now that you said it I'm assuming it makes that loud noise that makes you jump.,Neutral
1280,Yep I think that's the one. Do you have a dog by the way? I like my dog because she keeps me safe while I'm watching a horror movie LOL,Curious to dive deeper
1280,I have cats now but I've had many dogs. I love all animals.,Happy
1280," I love dogs personally, I never knew that there were 12 different blood types for them",Surprised
1280,I didn't either. You would think that emergency animal hospitals would have to keep an insane amount of blood on hand then.,Neutral
1280," Yeah you would think so, it's crazy that they do dog blood drives too, but you would need to do that in case you ever needed the transfusion",Surprised
1280,That's a very good idea. I'm glad they do that. Did you know that dogs and elephants are the only animals that instinctively understand pointing?,Curious to dive deeper
1280," No I didn't, I wonder why gorillas are other smart animals don't understand that? Did you also know that Istanbul has trained its wild dogs to pick up trash and then it will reimburse them with food",Surprised
1280,Another great idea. We should absolutely implement that here. There is no downside.,Happy
1280," Yep I agree with you. What do you think about dogs not being color-blind? They can see colors just not as many as humans, why does everyone say they're colorblind LOL",Surprised
1280,I always suspected that that was a myth. I've had dogs that preferred toys of a certain color.,Neutral
1280,And it just doesn't make sense that they would not be able to see colors LOL. Are you happy that Google is a dog company? It's stated in their code of conduct,Happy
1280,That's an odd thing to have in their code of conduct. I'd be happier if they loved all pets ha ha.,Neutral
1281," How's it going, do you like horror films? I enjoy watching ones based on supernatural and macabre themes",Curious to dive deeper
1281," hi, how are you? i am not really into horror films. there are a few i like though.",Neutral
1281," They're not for everyone, it's pretty cool the creepy metallic sound is made by an instrument called the waterphone",Neutral
1281,waterphone? like a saxophone? i wonder how you play that instrument.,Neutral
1281," I don't know, I might be too scared to play the waterphone, the name even sounds creepy",Fearful
1281," Yeah, its creepy. good for breaking the ice at parties. LOL by the way, do you like dogs?",Neutral
1281," Yea, dogs are pretty awesome and were the first species to be domesticated",Happy
1281,I think dogs are better than most people. i dont own one though. i wish i did. You?,Neutral
1281," My brother has a Jack Russel, he's pretty cool but isn't useful for much besides companionship lol",Neutral
1281," yes, they are fun little dogs. energetic, but not good at protection. i prefer bigger dogs. ",Neutral
1281,I wonder if google prefers any particular dog breed since they officially prefer dogs over cats,Neutral
1281," probably dont want huge dogs in the office taking up space. but still, it is good for morale to have dogs around. ",Neutral
1281," Yea, dogs would be pretty useful since they can instinctively understand pointing",Neutral
1281," Yeah, just like elephants. Perhaps a pet elephant would be good. does google allow elephantts?",Neutral
1281,Maybe. It's pretty crazy dogs have 12 different blood types,Surprised
1281,I guess its because they have so many breeds. i wonder which blood type is the most common.,Neutral
1281,Me too. I wonder if other animals have a lot of blood types like snakes or a legless lizard,Curious to dive deeper
1281,I bet there is variation. i would not want to run a blood drive for snakes though. LOL,Neutral
1281," Well you can go to New Zealand, there are no snakes there",Neutral
1281," I guess NZ is the place for me. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
1281," Yes, have a good one",Neutral
1282," Have you seen the photos of the Revolutionary War-era ship in main? Sometimes it's visible, mostly during storms.",Happy
1282," Yes, I did.  I've heard it surfaced in 1958 and 2007.  It's pretty interesting.",Curious to dive deeper
1282," I love shipwrecks. Somewhere off the east coast, there are four steam engines, and you can dive there.",Happy
1282,Dangerous diving.  Lots of WWII ships out there too.  Storms have unearthed some other stuff too like a sharp-toothed sea creature snake like thing.,Curious to dive deeper
1282," That was in Galveston. A friend lives there, and said it was mayhem at the beach when the hurricane uncovered it.",Happy
1282,I bet.  Like something out of a horror film.,Curious to dive deeper
1282,Right? I love how Steven King thins Bambi is a horror movie.,Neutral
1282,He's kinda right you know - mom killed in front of baby!  I like Dean Koontz stories because there's almost always a dog and he never lets the dog die in the story!,Curious to dive deeper
1282," I adore Dean Koontz. Dogs are my favorite things, they are fascinating creatures, and they can donate blood to other doggs.",Happy
1282," Yes, and I've heard there are 12 different blood types dogs have and there are doggie blood drives!",Curious to dive deeper
1282," Those are so cool, I would love to go to one. Google is a dog company, and you can bring your buddy to work with you.",Happy
1282," I didn't know they let you bring them to work.  That's cool.  You know, I can't remember one horror film aside from Cujo by Stephen King that had a bad dog in it.",Curious to dive deeper
1282," If you think about it, Cujo wasn't really a bad dog. He was just sick. They truly are man's best friend.",Neutral
1282,I agree they are.  Snakes on the other hand . . . Snakes on a plane still bothers me.,Curious to dive deeper
1282," I've never seen it. Like monkeys, I'm terrified of snakes, and won't watch anything that has them in it. I don't even like legless lizards.",Neutral
1282,They probably get a bad rap.  They are the best rodent hunters.  There are none in New Zealand and I've heard none in Ireland.,Curious to dive deeper
1282," I want nothing to do with them. Lizards, I love. As long as they have limbs. It's kinda cool how they (snakes) can rearrange their internal organs though.",Neutral
1282,I didn't know they could.  If you touch one it feels kinda nice.  I think they scare us because some are venomous.,Curious to dive deeper
1282," I would much rather encounter a dog, than a snake. They are so much nicer, and so therapeutic.",Neutral
1282," Dogs have long associated with humans.  Snakes, not so much.",Curious to dive deeper
1282,Snakes have been associated with evil since the beginning of time.,Neutral
1282," Yes, they have been.  Hey, great chatting with you.",Happy
1283,Have you ever been ice fishing before? I don't think i could stand the cold.,Curious to dive deeper
1283," Good afternoon, no I've never been ice fishing.  I live in Florida and ice fishing holds no appeal to me! Lol",Happy
1283,Me either i just heard that chip Lohmiller took three of his redskins colleges ice fishing before the super bowl in 92.,Curious to dive deeper
1283," That was nice of him, I guess?  I would have politely declined the invitation, I believe.  I like to eat fish.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1283,I do too but i have never been fishing or had to clean them. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
1283," Yes, I love to fish, fresh or salt doesn't matter.  Never cleaned them, let my husband do that job!",Happy
1283,Well i think that's fair you catch he cleans. So is it true that freshwater fish only drink water through their skin.,Curious to dive deeper
1283," That's what they say and the salt water fish can also drink through their mouths, as well.  I don't know for sure if that's true or not, really.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1283,Wow fascinating. Not as much as the Immortal jellyfish. Have you heard of it?,Curious to dive deeper
1283," No, I've seen many jellyfish while we've been off shore fishing in the Gulf of Mexico, but I don't think they were this type. About the weirdest fish I've caught is the sheephead fish and it had teeth like a human.  I took one look and told my husband get him off my line and throw him back, he was too creepy looking. ",Surprised
1283," Yeah i bet. the immortal jelly fish has the capability of starting it's life cycle over as a defense against predator. I had to do some research on that one, lol. ",Curious to dive deeper
1283," That's neat, wish I could start my lie cycle over, too.  Someone needs to be studying this jellyfish.  May have the key to our immortality.",Curious to dive deeper
1283," Right! So you know about the fish that can eat prey twice it's own length and ten times it's own weight, that's way to much!!",Curious to dive deeper
1283," Black swallower, have heard of that one, but never caught one.  ",Neutral
1283,I assume their very large fish. The seahorse is classified as a fish even though it has a neck.,Curious to dive deeper
1283," Yeah, seahorse are very cute little creatures.  Have you ever seen one up close?",Curious to dive deeper
1283,I have not. Did you know that 84% of genes known to be associated with human decease have counterparts in Zebrafish. I never heard of a zebrafish.,Curious to dive deeper
1283," That's interesting, I actually saw one swimming off the coast of Daytona Beach, one time.  I didn't know it carried all these genes, though that are similar to humans.  bet there are lots of scientists studying that little fish.   ",Surprised
1283," Well they should and we should have a lot more cures than we do, course there no money in cures. ",Curious to dive deeper
1283," You are correct about that.  There's big money in test, treatments,and medications. Well, I know what I'm having for dinner now, either cajun stuffed flounder or blackened Mahi.  What's your favorite fish to eat?",Curious to dive deeper
1283," Cajun Salmon is my favorite. I stick to that because any other kind i have i would need to fry it, lol! ",Curious to dive deeper
1283," That sounds delicious.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you this afternoon about fish.  Hope you enjoy the rest of your Friday!",Happy
1284,Are you a fan of the washington redskins football team?,Neutral
1284," I like football, but not necessarily the Redskins.  I did hear that they went ice fishing in Minnesota before the 92 superbowl.",Neutral
1284,What a great way to prepare for a game go sit on a boat in the freezing cold lol,Surprised
1284,Right?! Maybe they thought it would acclimate them to the temps??? I mean the windchill was 30 below!,Curious to dive deeper
1284," Thats a great way to have somebody catch a classic case of hypothermia, I hope they had some nice food to warm them up afterwards",Neutral
1284,I wonder what kind of fish they caught? Did you know that a goldfish lived to be 43 years old?,Surprised
1284,They probably caught an icecube even 30 below is too cold for the fish lol I didnt know that. Do you know which is the only fish with a neck,Happy
1284,I don't. I didn't know any fish had a neck.  Hanako was a koi fish who lived to be 226 years old...he probably didn't have a neck! LOL,Neutral
1284,Its the seahorse people forget its considered a fish. Are sharks also considered fish?,Neutral
1284,I'm not sure...I did forget seahorses are fish! Did you know there is a fish that can live on land?!,Curious to dive deeper
1284," Which fish is that, is it a crab?",Curious to dive deeper
1284,I'm not sure...I'll you,Neutral
1284," Did you ever see the film finding nemo, thats a classic?",Happy
1284,It is! I meant to say before that I'll youtube that fish.  Did you know youtube started with a video of a guy talking about elephants?,Curious to dive deeper
1284,It did? I remember when youtube first blew up around 2006-2007 the good ol days before all the ads and commericals got included,Neutral
1284,Yes in 2007 youtube used as much bandwith as the entire internet did in 2000! That shows how much it blew up!,Surprised
1284,It also shows how much the whole internet expanded in just 7 short years,Neutral
1284,Yes...did you know it started as a dating site?,Curious to dive deeper
1284,I didnt even know that so what was the point of the videos?,Happy
1284,Maybe to see people in their natural environment? Clothing can tell you a lot about people too. Did you know a man wore 70 pieces of clothes to avoid a baggage charge at the airport?,Curious to dive deeper
1284,Well he better have went to the dry cleaners when he landed in his destination,Curious to dive deeper
1285,hi how are you doing over there?,Neutral
1285,I am good.  What's your opinion of the Washington Nationals manager Dave Martinez?,Curious to dive deeper
1285,dont really know much about him. what did he do?,Neutral
1285,He maintains positive relations with other teams.  He congratulates other teams when they are successful.,Neutral
1285,that is good. it is a sport after all. it represents sportsmanship to young people.,Neutral
1285,Yeah.  It's also great that baseball managers are able to play for their teams if they are needed.,Happy
1285," i cant imagine it now. but back in the day, i bet the manager did play regularly.",Neutral
1285," Yeah, dedication is also an admirable trait within baseball or any professional sport.  Like the married couple who for 24 years scheduled every single baseball game played during those years.",Neutral
1285," that must be an interesting job. i hope they used a computer. if not, oh man, what a headache.",Neutral
1285,Hard work pays off.  Consider the man who wrote a fantasy manuscript over fifteen thousand pages long.  I would love to read that!,Neutral
1285,i wonder if it is any good. that is a LONG manuscript. clearly a labor of love.,Neutral
1285,The difference between perceiving fantasy and reality is represented by a small difference in our brain.  Fantasy is an interesting book genre.,Curious to dive deeper
1285," boy, i wonder if i have that fold in my brain. perhaps i have lost it over the years. LOL",Neutral
1285," I always loved fantasy video games.  I like nonfiction books too.  Everything that is read is taken with a grain of salt, I guess.",Neutral
1285,I think that reading is a great way to experience new ideas and situations. I am glad that we have the ability to fantasize.,Neutral
1285,I don't believe I've ever read comedic fantasy before.  Comedic fantasy sounds interesting.,Curious to dive deeper
1285,Have you seen the princess bride? it is a movie that is pretty comic too. what about shrek?,Neutral
1285,Not sure if I've seen those movies.  Can you believe that a professional hockey player usually loses 8 pounds during a game?,Surprised
1285," If you like fantasy and comedy, maybe they fit the bill. 8 pounds? where does it go? LOL Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
1285," Yeah, anyone who has a goal to lose weight can start playing hockey games.  8 pounds in one game is a happy fantasy.",Neutral
1285,I guess i know my mission: play hockey. Have a good day!,Neutral
1285,You too!  Thank you for the chat!  Have a good day!,Happy
1286," Hello, interesting fact baseball managers have to wear uniforms because they could technically play for their team.",Surprised
1286,That rule must have been around from the beginning when players were chosen to manage as well.,Neutral
1286,I think it's very interesting that kickball is also called soccer-baseball Canada.,Surprised
1286,The Canadians are always trying to be different. There is nothing wrong with the word kickball. Do you know how many baseballs are used in one season in the MLB?,Curious to dive deeper
1286," I do not, but I do know that baseball cards from the 1900s can be worth three million dollars.",Surprised
1286,What would you do if you had those cards? I'd sell some and keep the rest for future appreciation.,Neutral
1286," That would be really smart, but I would probably sell them to have money to invest in the stock market. Another crazy thing is that baseball is so popular in Japan, but yet its america's national pastime. ",Surprised
1286,Japan loves to import things and turn them into a Japanese thing. The Japanese game is different in many ways. Close to a pastime for them.,Neutral
1286,I suppose that's true. Did you know that in 1924 Canada scored 132 goals in hockey during the first olympic winter games.,Surprised
1286," The Canadians don't have nothing else to do in Canada but play that hockey. They were champions, then the rest of the world changed. Canada fears global warming and the effect on their game.",Neutral
1286,Canada is actually also known for lacrosse.,Happy
1286," Lacrosse is also an intense physical sport, I can see its appeal to Canadians!",Neutral
1286,It's also interesting that hockey players lose up to 8 pounds in one game. That shows that they work hard.,Surprised
1286,They do work hard. That's a lot of weight. I should take up pro hockey for the weight loss.,Neutral
1286,It's hard to believe that back in 1993 a hockey player got traded for a dollar.,Surprised
1286,Boy that team must have wanted to get rid of him.,Neutral
1286,I guess which turned out to be a mistake because he went on to win four Stanley Cups.,Surprised
1286,That's a way to show your old team! Glad to see he did well.,Neutral
1286," It's cool that ice hockey is played in countries like Finland, Latvia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.",Surprised
1286," In those countries, hockey is probably a natural solution to boredom, there's already so much ice to be had!",Neutral
1286,Have you ever heard of bandy before I guess it's another type of hockey?,Surprised
1286,Ain't never heard of it. Is it fun? Is it violent?,Neutral
1286," It's still played on ice, but with a ball instead of a puck. ",Happy
1286," That sounds like a very different game. I guess that's for people that need a change. Well, I had fun chatting with you tonight.",Neutral
1286,It's been a pleasure.,Happy
1286,Good night.,Neutral
1286,good night,Neutral
1286,Sayonara.,Neutral
1286,Bye,Neutral
1287,Do you like baseball?,Curious to dive deeper
1287,Yes I enjoy watching baseball games.,Curious to dive deeper
1287," Nice, is it your favorite sport? ",Curious to dive deeper
1287,Not my favorite.  My grandfather is a major fan.  He was telling me that a man found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfather's attic.,Curious to dive deeper
1287," I love it. I was a pitcher, I think people that don't like it are crazy! ",Curious to dive deeper
1287,What do you think about hockey?  Did you know that an average professional player can lose up to eight pounds in one game?,Curious to dive deeper
1287,I think it's great.,Curious to dive deeper
1287,Well Canada is the only country in the world with two national sports Lacrosse and Ice Hockey.,Sad
1287," Interesting, both are really cool But hockey is better, I guess they couldn't decide!",Curious to dive deeper
1287,Very interesting.   One time a hockey player was traded for $1 in 1993 and won four Stanley Cups.,Curious to dive deeper
1287," Nice, so how much is $1 worth in Canada? ",Curious to dive deeper
1287," Not worth much, but what a good trade.  Can you guess what is under a basketball court in a sport stadium?",Curious to dive deeper
1287," No, what? An Ice Rink?",Curious to dive deeper
1287,Yes! Ice Hockey ring.,Happy
1287," Hilarious, that almost sounds like a fantasy!",Curious to dive deeper
1287," Speaking of fantasy, did you know that author Terry Pratchett was knighted for his ""services to literature.""",Curious to dive deeper
1287," No, I didn't know that. How is that? ",Curious to dive deeper
1287,He probably was knighted by the queen of England since this the only country that knights people.  She knighted Elton John.,Curious to dive deeper
1287," No, serious? Get out of town!",Curious to dive deeper
1287," I am as serious as a janitor in Chicago wrote 15,145 page fantasy manuscript with over 300 watercolor illustrations which was only discovered after his death. ",Neutral
1287," Nice, well nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
1288,Good morning!  Do you watch baseball?,Neutral
1288,hi how are you? i sometimes watch baseball. YOu?,Neutral
1288,I do too.  Did you ever wonder why the managers wear uniforms?,Neutral
1288," I thought it was from the old days, but maybe im wrong.",Neutral
1288,It could be from rule back then.  They wear them in case the need arises for them to play.  I've never seen one play though.,Neutral
1288," maybe in the old days, the team chose one player to be a manager as well. ",Neutral
1288," They could have.  You know, baseball cards from the old days are worth quite a bit of money now.",Neutral
1288,I think the Honus Wagner card is the biggie. i dont know how much it is worth now though.,Neutral
1288,I don't either. I heard though that a man found three million dollars worth of baseball cards. His were from the 1900s though.,Neutral
1288,that is quite old and quite rare. i bet those cards would be worth even more now.,Neutral
1288,I bet so too.  They'd be worth even more in Japan I imagine.  Baseball has gotten so popular over there that they are surprised to learn it's our national pastime.,Neutral
1288,the japanese really do like the sport. the high school is really a big thing there. a televised tournament twice a year.,Neutral
1288,I wonder if it's popular in Canada.  There they call kickball soccer-baseball.,Neutral
1288," Yeah, there is baseball in canada, but the national sports are hockey and lacrosse. soccer-baseball? Huh?",Neutral
1288," Yep, weird isn't it?  I watch hockey every now and then. It seems interesting.  Do you watch hockey?",Neutral
1288,I dont watch hockey. i dont really understand the strategy and the rules.,Neutral
1288,Well I guess it's great exercise.  I hear that a player can lose like 8 pounds in one game.,Neutral
1288,I bet they can. the exertion is tremendous. probably a good wait loss program for many of us LOL,Neutral
1288,I was thinking that very same thing!  There should be ice rinks everywhere.,Neutral
1288," Yeah, it would be good for people to move more. we are designed to move. not just sit and chat. LOL Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
1288,Lol!  It's been great chatting with you too!  Have a good one!,Neutral
1289,hi how are you today? let's talk about clothing and shoes!,Neutral
1289,I'm great thanks! Sounds good to me. I love shoes. I Iike both basic sandals and high-end fashion shoes. You?,Curious to dive deeper
1289," I am a basic person. i have basic clothing, basic shoes. ",Neutral
1289,Nice. Did you know that professional ballet dancers can go through four pairs of shoes in a week?,Surprised
1289,I believe it. those shoes look dainty. i would probably go through a dozen myself. LOL,Neutral
1289," Yes definitely! I love how shoes are designed for all purposes, for example there are specific shoes for mountaineering or skiing.",Happy
1289," Yes, they are quite versatile and useful. i usually use basic tennis and running shoes. no ballet shoes. LOL",Neutral
1289,Yes me as well! Apparently 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern day shoes. I want to know how they found that out.,Curious to dive deeper
1289,I bet those shoes were built to last a lifetime. probably couldnt replace or fix them easily.,Neutral
1289," Yeah definitely I want to I want to know they're made of? If you have stinky shoes just put dry teabags in there, they absorb the stinky smell.",Happy
1289," Just one teabag? for my stinky shoes, it might take a dozen LOL",Neutral
1289," Ha ha well that would even work better! In addition the shoes I also like close. There's a store in Alabama that only sells clothes, cameras, and other things found in unclaimed baggage at airports.",Surprised
1289," I wonder if there is any good stuff there, or if it is just stinky shoes and the like.",Neutral
1289,If that is the case make sure you bring lots of teabags! Apple even had a clothing line in 1986.,Happy
1289," I would never buy apple clothing, especially from 1986. too geeky",Neutral
1289,Yeah definitely. Rip curl makes clothes in North Korea but the label actually says made in China. I would like to know why this is?,Curious to dive deeper
1289,I guess to hide the fact that they are breaking a serious law? I would not want to help NK and their dictator.,Neutral
1289,Me neither. Back in the old days the pilgrim clothing was full of color they only wore black for special occasions!,Surprised
1289," I guess the stereotype of prim pilgrims sells better. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
1289,Yeah I suppose so. I wonder if their clothing was gender specific? Because some clothing can be. It was very nice talking with you too I hope you have a good Saturday.,Curious to dive deeper
1289,Have a good weekend!,Neutral
1289,You too bye!,Happy
1290,Hi! Do you like shoes?,Curious to dive deeper
1290,I do.  Do you have interesting facts about them?,Curious to dive deeper
1290,I do! Something that I did not know was that ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.,Curious to dive deeper
1290,Wow.  That's a lot.  I would not be able to afford them.,Surprised
1290,Me either. I feel like that is such a waste. I wonder what they do after they wear through the shoe that fast.,Curious to dive deeper
1290,I don't know.  I heard that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes.  I wonder who owns 5000 year old shoes.,Curious to dive deeper
1290,It is probably because they did not care about fashion back then.,Curious to dive deeper
1290," What I meant was that someone made a comparison to come up with his or her fact.  So, her or she must have had the 5000 year old shoes to compare with modern shoes.",Curious to dive deeper
1290,I see. I would love to see who made them and why they performed better.,Curious to dive deeper
1290,Do you know who leaves his cleats on the field after every game?  It's a trivia question.,Curious to dive deeper
1290,Is it steve smith?,Surprised
1290,Yes it is.  I wonder who got to keep them.,Curious to dive deeper
1290,Do you know why he left them on the field?,Curious to dive deeper
1290," Yes, he did.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1290,He did it to raise awareness to homeless people without shoes.,Curious to dive deeper
1290,That is a good thing.  The shoes should be auctioned and proceeds should be used to buy shoes for the homeless people.,Neutral
1290,I agree. I love the exposure to the cause. I hope it has been effective.,Curious to dive deeper
1290,I hope so too.  Are you familiar with Stephon Marbury?,Curious to dive deeper
1290,I am not. Who is that?,Curious to dive deeper
1290,He is a former professional basketball player.  He promoted a line of shoes (retail price of only $15) and was not paid to endorse them.,Neutral
1290,Wow that is crazy. I am going to look more into him. Have a nice day.,Curious to dive deeper
1291,Hello!  Do you follow any celebrities?,Happy
1291," sort of, not really all of te gossip but i do follow some comedians on twitter. do you?",Neutral
1291,A little bit.  Pixar has a secret room that is often visited by celebrities.  Wonder what's in there?,Happy
1291,i like to think its a giant ball put for adults to play in. just relax and unwind. that would be fun,Neutral
1291," LOL  That's funny!  The highest paid celebrity is kind of surprising.  It's Judge Judy who makes $123,000 per episode.  A lot of people must be tuning it to watch her for them to be able to pay her that.  That's nuts.",Happy
1291,imagine that? i cant beleive that. all she does is sit there and yell at people! no wonder she is never going to retire,Neutral
1291,Right?  lol  Robin Williams was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities doing voices in animated films when he did Aladdin.,Happy
1291,and he wasnt even going to do it! they had to fight with him. thats why he didnt to the 2nd Alaadin movie,Neutral
1291,Oh wow.  I didn't know that!  Speaking of another first...Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on Sesame Street.,Happy
1291,wow! I always liked that show when I was growing up. Did you ever watch it?,Surprised
1291,I did.  Do they still make new episodes?,Happy
1291," I want to say they do, i dont watch it at all but I dont think it will ever end",Neutral
1291,It has to be a one of the longest running shows I would think.  On another topic....did you know that Apple had a clothing line in 1986?  I had no idea.,Happy
1291," I bet it was a bunch of black turtlenecks and nothing else, Steve Jobs old go to outfit",Surprised
1291,LOL  That's funny!  Pilgrims wore clothes that were full of color and only wore black for special occasions.  I don't think I've ever seen a drawing/image of a pilgrim wearing anything other than black and whie.,Happy
1291," I was thinking about that too, but maybe all of the pictures we saw were just special occassions, regular days were something they never documented",Neutral
1291,I think you're right.  There's a store in Alabama that only sells items that were found in unclaimed baggage at airports.  Wonder if they have to pay for that stuff or if they get it for free to resell?,Happy
1291,I think its a fun idea to do that! did you know that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes? guess they were built to last back then,Neutral
1291,Wow.  That's pretty incredible.  My shoes smell really bad.  Do you have any tips to help them not smell?,Happy
1291," i hear dry tea bags do wonders, which is strange to me but i guess it makes sense",Neutral
1291,Wow.  I'll have to try that!  Thanks for the good tip!  It's been a pleasure chatting with you.  Have a good day!,Happy
1292,Are you familiar with David Christian's work?,Neutral
1292,I am not. Who is he and what has he done?,Curious to dive deeper
1292,He is an author that seems to re-imagine history.  In a context.  Something about one thing building on the next.  Society today is based on development of agriculture.,Neutral
1292,Agriculture is very necessary obviously. At one point in time I believe it employed the most people. But I would argue that that is moving to technology rather quickly.,Curious to dive deeper
1292,One quote from David is Homo Sapiens went from stone tools to possessing nuclear weapons. That is rather fast indeed.  Some how Agriculture is responsible for Taylor Swift and Kim Jong Un.,Neutral
1292,Do you know how he came to that conclusion?,Curious to dive deeper
1292," The text David wrote is called ""Original Story"".  In it he attempts to provide origin stories that are the reason we got to this point.  Which I find reasonable.  The reviewer of the book is taking a left turn. ",Neutral
1292," Interesting, I will have to look into that more. On another note, are you interested in space?",Curious to dive deeper
1292," Space is big. really, really big.  the observable universe is more than I can comprehend.  But I like space just fine.",Neutral
1292,It is very interesting. Did you know that there are stars cold enough to be touched?,Curious to dive deeper
1292,I find that an odd thing to say.  Is the density low enough that you can withdraw your hand?  Philosophy is the smile on a dog.,Neutral
1292,Well I can't imagine that there is anyway you could get close enough to actually do it but in theory you could. I also hear that there is a theory that there is only one electron in the universe. I find that very confusing because there are electrons in every atom.,Curious to dive deeper
1292,We picture electrons flowing through circuits without the atoms as well.,Neutral
1292,I have no idea how they came to that conclusion. Did you also know that when first formed an Earth days was only 5.5 hours long?,Curious to dive deeper
1292,I find that interesting.  But that time was 4.5 billion years ago.  Presumably the day is getting longer since then and will continue to lengthen. The density of the earth is interesting.,Happy
1292,It is very interesting. You would think we would have to get further from the sun for that to happen and I hope it does not. Did you also know that we are running out of helium?,Curious to dive deeper
1292," Helium Free in the 21st century.  I assume they mean the natural occurring.  We will make helium for use in balloons. If the density of earth were increased, the helium would not escape.",Neutral
1292," Yes I'm sure it's natural helium. For perspective, if we looked at the history of earth as one day, people would only be present for 1 minute and 17 seconds. ",Curious to dive deeper
1292," Wait, Humans lost body hair 240,000 years ago. So, the last 17 seconds we would be pink, before that furry.",Happy
1292,That seems to be the case. At least somewhere close to that. Did you also know that more than 80% of our forests have been destroyed?,Curious to dive deeper
1292," Yes, humans are good at destruction.  Its like we have high levels of abstract reasoning, language, problem solving.  And the problem is all these forests.  Nuke from orbit is the only way to be sure.",Happy
1292,Well hopefully it does not get worse and we plant more trees quickly to replace some of what we have lost. Nice chatting with you. Have a nice day.,Neutral
1293," Hello inhabitant of the planet earth. Are you human or chimp? Specifically, are you homo sapien?",Happy
1293," Ha! Homo sapien, I believe. Which, I suppose, makes me pretty old -- at least 50,000 years since I started acting ""modern.""",Happy
1293," Have you lost all your hair? Most humans lost body hair about 240,000 years ago. If you are still hairy, you are quite old indeed.",Happy
1293," We're getting somewhat personal. :-) But I guess we all pretty much come from Africa, chimps and humans.",Curious to dive deeper
1293," I am from the planet Doorlocke. We are hairless too. But wee have one difference with humans: There is no frequency of sound that causes us fear, unless you count the sound of an empty Pringles can, but that is less fear that sadness.",Happy
1293," Ah, the sound of sadness is a sad sound indeed. Hey, Doorlockean, what happens when you get a rib shortened? We humans can regrow one just as strong as the original one, and in just two to three months.",Happy
1293," We are snail-shaped, and without ribs, so, we've got that going for us. I guess we are earlier of the evolutionary tree that you are.If your history was viewed as a 24-hour day, humans would occupy only 1 minute and 17 seconds. We would occupy much less. About 4 bleems and a nibblet.",Happy
1293," So, I have no idea where Doorlocke is. Earth is the third planet from the Sun. Most of the surface, about 70 percent, is covered with water. We also have a moon.",Neutral
1293," A moon. I have heard of this hazing ritual. I come from a planet that circles a star that is so cold, you can touch it with your hand. It is called Cold Rock of the Sun. We do not/have not moon.",Happy
1293," Cool! So, you believe your plant circles a star? We tend to believe the Earth circle the Sun. But a long time ago, folks here thought differently. They thought the Earth was the center of the universe and everything revolved around it. Then a guy name Copernicus proved it isn't so.",Neutral
1293," Ah, great thinker... We have such a great thinker in our ancestry. He was the Great Snail-o-pithicus. He postulated that the universe may be one giant superhologram. Since we do not know what a hologram is, we blindly accepted the inane ramblings of this drunken master as fact. Now we are begining to suspect it was all fake news.",Happy
1293," Interesting theory. I have heard of a theory that there is just one electron in the universe. I can't quite get my head around that, even with my human brain that is relatively large and is able to handle high levels of abstract reasoning.",Neutral
1293," Your immense intellect has reminded me of why I have come to your planet. We need help with a profound mystery. It appears that the a region of space may be pulling galaxies outside of the known universe. I believe you call this location, ""Cleveland""",Happy
1293," Ha! Are you saying Cleveland sucks? I wonder if we shouldn't run in away then. We humans are among the best distance runners, at least compared to other animals here on Earth.",Happy
1293," ""Run away"" That is a concept difficult for a space-snail to appreciate. Our scientists theorize that the universe evolves, much like species on earth do. Someday, all men will be like DOnald Trump, and all women will be like Nancy Pelosi. I fear our species will never achieve such advanced evolutionary stae.",Happy
1293," I figured you might say something like that. Say, since you're an ""extraterrestrial"" by our definition, I was wondering if you have ever encountered an Earth ambassador? Back in 2010, our United Nations appointed an official ambassador to extraterrestrials in case they would ever make contact with Earth.",Curious to dive deeper
1293," I met someone named ""Buzz"" who had a friend named ""Woody"" - Could this be your earth's ambassador? It was along time ago, back when our planet was new and each day was only 5.5 hours long, similar to when your planet was new.",Happy
1293," Gee, I don't know. Wouldn't surprise me. I don't know what you've heard about Earth, but it's not the greatest place, no thanks to us humans. For example, we've managed to already destroy more than 80 percent of all our forests.",Sad
1293," Or plant has no remaining forests, and our helium reserves are so low, our balooons no longer float. Before I depart, I must collect some of Earths remains helium supply before that disappears as well. I also want a Happy Meal.",Happy
1293," We don't have much helium left, so go easy. Need any tools while you're at it? We humans are really good at using tools, more so than any other animal. We also can build fires and cook food. And snail-like creatures like yourself should be careful in that regard...",Neutral
1293," Thank you for your kindness. Now if you could point the way to a sushi bar, I will be on my way. Nanu nanu.",Happy
1294," hello, do you know much about humans?",Curious to dive deeper
1294," well I know that I am one and they appeared about 300,000 years ago in teh fossil record, what about you",Curious to dive deeper
1294,I know that we lost our body hair only 240 000 years ago,Curious to dive deeper
1294," ya humans haven't been around for long, if history were 24 hours long humans would only exist for about a minute",Surprised
1294,That is just incredible. Did you know we are the only one who cannot synthesize vitamin C?,Curious to dive deeper
1294," haha that is weird, I wonder why, and I wonder if we can edit our genes to fix that that would be cool!",Curious to dive deeper
1294," I know, maybe we leave it to evolution to take care of that. Pretty cool that plants and other animals can though",Curious to dive deeper
1294," ya, and we are also the only animal that can't breathe and swallow at the same time, so there is that too haha",Surprised
1294," yes, I guess we are not as advanced as we like to think. so for now we stick to lemons to get out vitamins",Curious to dive deeper
1294," right, also leftover from evolution is goose bumps, that makes furry animals appear larger",Surprised
1294,true. Did you know there is a sound frequence that causes fear in humans?,Curious to dive deeper
1294," no I didn't know that, but I did know that humans can't burp in zero gravity haha",Surprised
1294," Wow , that  is so funny. Did you know we can regrow a rib in 2-3 months",Curious to dive deeper
1294,wow I didn't know that! can other animals do that? maybe it would be better to sustainably harvest animal ribs instead of killing them haha,Curious to dive deeper
1294," Well, that is a sad one. Do you know much about the earth?",Curious to dive deeper
1294," well I do know that it is about four times as dense as the sun, what about you?",Surprised
1294," More than 80% of the forests are gone, sadly",Curious to dive deeper
1294," that is sad, but I think Jupiter is the unsung hero of the planets, it acts like a shield and has saved the earth from asteroids",Surprised
1294,That is so cool. Did you know when earth was formed the day only had 5.5 hours?,Curious to dive deeper
1294," no I didn't know that, also didn't know the earths poles reverse every 300k years, I wonder when the next one is due",Surprised
1294,That would be interested. Nice chatting with you.,Happy
1295," Hello, Do you know There are at least 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe?",Happy
1295," I did not know that. Have you read the book mentioned in my article, ""Origin Story""?",Happy
1295," Sorry, i do not know about that. ",Happy
1295,What was your article about?,Curious to dive deeper
1295,I'm talking about the universe.,Happy
1295,That's what mine was about too. The title can be a little misleading. Are you interested in this topic??,Curious to dive deeper
1295," Of course I am interested, Please explain me.",Happy
1295,Is this something you know a lot about? I really do not get too interested in the universe and that topic. It either goes above my head or bores me. I want to read that book to see if it changes anything in me. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
1295,I am very interested in knowing the universe. But it knows little about it.,Happy
1295," Well, I read the universe tends to be opaque.",Neutral
1295," Of course, The mere fact that we live in a universe boggles my mind every once in a while. ",Happy
1295,Some researchers even belive that our universe could be living inside a of a black hole. How weird is that?,Neutral
1295," Yes, I I've heard A new theory posited by a group of physicists presents the possibility that our universe is nestled inside a black hole.",Happy
1295," Before this article, I had not heard that. Had you?",Surprised
1295,I do not know completely. I've shared some of the things I've heard.,Happy
1295,There is a cold spot in the cosmic microwave background that has been theorized to be a link to a parallel universe.,Curious to dive deeper
1295,That's nice. Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.,Happy
1295,Did you ever see the show 3rd rock from the sun?,Curious to dive deeper
1295,I have not seen so far. Have you ever seen?,Happy
1295," Yes, I have seen it. It was funny. From the 90s...",Neutral
1295," Wow! it's amazing, Can you say a little about the experience?",Happy
1295," It was an average TV show about the earth and being the third planet from the sun, like your post mentioned. Just thought it was intersecting.",Neutral
1295," Yes, that's nice. Thank you very much. ",Happy
1295,Have a weekend.,Neutral
1296," What is your favorite thing about Amazon?  Mine is the shopping site,  I can pretty much find anything!",Neutral
1296,Yes I like that site. How are you ?,Curious to dive deeper
1296,Im doing great!  How are you? I really love the prime videos as well!,Neutral
1296,I am good too. I am reading about Human and facts. Did you knowHumans are adapted for persistence hunting making them among the best distance runners among all running animals.,Happy
1296," I did not know that until now,  thanks for the info!  Does this subject interest you?",Neutral
1296,Its all I have to work from we prob have different stuff no biggie. Tell me more about your topic.,Curious to dive deeper
1296," I think my subjects actually changed,  I had Amazon a few seconds ago and now that I looked back on it I have completely different topics.  Sorry for the confusion. ",Surprised
1296,its ok lol,Neutral
1296,I think it is amazing that humans will regrow a rib equally as strong as the original within only 2-3 months of having it surgically shortened!,Surprised
1296,I agree but I wonder for what reason someone would need their rib shortened in you know?,Happy
1296," hmm I dont know haha,  Maybe some kind of accident or event that happened to them that they need surgery to do this.  I cant think why anyone would need to do this purposely.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1296,lol Yea me either I think its neat that there is There is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans.,Curious to dive deeper
1296," Me too!  I was going to look it up after this!  Thats interesting and scary.  I wonder if people use that sound to purposely cause fear in humans.  for example,  do they use this sound in scary movies or theme parks etc.  Also,  thats kind of a bummer that we dont produce vitamin c on our own,  just another vitamin we have to take on a daily basis. ",Curious to dive deeper
1296,Yea wow,Surprised
1296,when the earth first formed a day was only 5.5 hours...how do they even know this lol although that would be kinda cool if humans only had to work like 2 hours a day.,Happy
1296,"  About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans. The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes, rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere.",Surprised
1296," Also amazing,  i love those shows about ocean life,  theres a whole way of life down there,  do you ever watch Blue Planet?  Whats your favorite water animal?  I love Orcas and Octopus",Curious to dive deeper
1296,I am not sure really  whats yours?,Happy
1296," I love Orca's,  Octopus' and Sharks. ",Happy
1296,Awesome its been good talking to ya give us a good rating,Happy
1296," Will do,  have a great day!",Neutral
1296,You too!,Happy
1297," Hello, are you interested in space and the universe?",Curious to dive deeper
1297,Yes I am!  I always wondered if the universe may exist in a black hole.,Happy
1297,I don't know enough about black holes to know if that would be a good thing or a bad thing.,Curious to dive deeper
1297,lol  Me neither.  I always thought that they were a bad thing.  lol  They say that there is a cold spot in the cosmic microwave background that has been theorized to be a link to a parallet universe.  Pretty deep huh?  lol,Happy
1297,That would be really interesting. It's amazing that there is so much out there that we can only theorize about.,Curious to dive deeper
1297," I agree.  If you were to fold a piece of paper in half 103 times it would be as thick as the observable universe.  (the little cartoon bubble just went off over my head saying ""now you know....""  lol)",Happy
1297,I saw an episode of Mythbusters where they had to use a steamroller to fold a piece a paper after a couple of times. 103 would be impossible!,Neutral
1297,Oh man.  I love that show!  It never gets old.  Did you know that Earth was formed over 4.5 billion years ago?,Happy
1297,Yes I know there are people who believe it is only 2000 years old but I believe what the researchers and scientists have discovered.,Neutral
1297,I'm with you.  71 percent of the Earths surface is covered with water.  Incredible that there are some parts of the world that are suffering from water shortages.,Surprised
1297,It's unfortunate that a lot of that water is not potable. Hopefully we can make some advancements in desalinization and help those areas.,Neutral
1297,Yes I agree.  I didn't know that Jupiter saves Earth from many asteroids heading towards it.  That makes sense.,Happy
1297,Luckily it's so big it probably draws a lot of them into it's gravitational field.,Curious to dive deeper
1297," Yes.  If Earth's entire history was viewed in a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds.  We're just a blip on the history of the Earth.",Happy
1297,It's amazing to think how little we've existed in relation to how old the universe is.,Surprised
1297,Yes.  The direction of the Earth's magnetic field reverses every 200 to 300 thousand years.  Would that make rivers flow in different directions then?,Happy
1297,I wish I knew enough about science to answer that one. That would be something if they suddenly changed directions.,Surprised
1297,I'm not sure if that's magnetic or gravity.  I'm thinking magnetic because a friend of mine has been south of the equator to South America.  Have you ever noticed when you flush a toilet and the water will swirl one way?  He said in South America the water swirled opposite of here in the states.,Happy
1297," I have never been south of the Equator, I would love to see that in person.",Curious to dive deeper
1297,Me too.  I don't think I'll ever get there unfortunately.  Speaking of gravity...the Hudson Bay region of Canada has been found to have less gravity than the rest of the Earth.  That's odd.,Happy
1297,Yeah that is really odd. It's been fun chatting about science with you!,Happy
1298," I found the article about humans to be super fascinating. I could not believe it was only 240,000 years ago where we lost all the body hair.",Surprised
1298," Well, the Earth was much colder then, it would have still been needed.",Curious to dive deeper
1298,Did you find anything interesting about the article? What was your favorite?,Curious to dive deeper
1298,I was surprised by the fact about some stars being so cold humans could touch them.,Curious to dive deeper
1298," Yeah, I was also suprised by that fact, as well as interested about the theory that there is only one electron in the universe.",Surprised
1298," Yeah, I knew the stories about Kepler and Copernicus, but the facts below were pretty interesting. ",Neutral
1298,It's sad that 80 percent of the earth's forests have been destroyed.,Curious to dive deeper
1298,Sad and dangerous to everything living on the Earth. The Earth being helium free sounds alarming too.,Disgusted
1298," Yeah, at the rate at which we are destroying the earth and the elements are getting scarce. It makes me very nervous for future generations. We should be doing more to prevent it.",Curious to dive deeper
1298," True. Hmm, wish they had said a little more in the Earth facts.",Surprised
1298," Yes, I would love to learn more about our Earth.",Curious to dive deeper
1298,Just saw the natural selection theory about universes. That's kind of unexpected.,Curious to dive deeper
1298,I am much more interested in the Earth than the Universe. Interesting when the earth first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long.,Surprised
1298," That makes sense, it was smaller, hotter and unfinished. The Earth's orbit would have been much different.",Neutral
1298," yes, but I would have thought maybe 12 hours, but I did not think things were that short.",Curious to dive deeper
1298,I would have guessed a little longer too. But a planet goes through a huge amount of changes in 4.5 billion years.,Neutral
1298,I know crazy that humans have such a short existence in all that.,Curious to dive deeper
1298,It took that long for Earth to be a place where we could survive.,Neutral
1298,Are you a believer in the big bang theory or are you spiritual and religious? Just out of curiosity?,Curious to dive deeper
1298,I believe in science. And nothing in the bible actually says the age of the Earth or that Adam and Eve weren't early humans.,Neutral
1298,Interesting!,Neutral
1299," I think that people are really overreacting to a style shift in a comic, I'm sure after 80 years the character needed an update.",Surprised
1299," You mean Nancy?  Yeah, people hate change, it's not like you can't go back to the old bare bones version if it doesn't work out.",Curious to dive deeper
1299," I think that in this day and age, you need to capture the younger viewer to make your medium longer lasting. They may not relate to the same jokes that have sustained the comic industry for so long.",Surprised
1299,There will always be people that complain about change.  In the age of the internet anyone can put their complaints online.  Cartoons always have new writer and they have to put their spin on it.,Surprised
1299,I think that having a cartoonist put their own spin on it can lead to amazing advancements. Frank Miller really did some great work on Batman and it led to critically acclaimed movies in the long run.,Neutral
1299,I'm not that familiar with comic books.  I've heard of Frank Miller though.  Was he involved in the Watchman series?,Curious to dive deeper
1299," No, it's a similarly dark take on a story. Alan Moore was the author of the Watchmen novel.",Curious to dive deeper
1299,Those comic books seem a lot more sophisticated than the days of Superman.  I'm sure the writers get more than the $130 DC paid for the rights to Superman.,Surprised
1299,I believe it's become more of an event now when certain writers become involved in a franchise. I know Kevin Smith and Brian Quinn have had featured runs in comics.,Surprised
1299," Is that the director Kevin Smith?  I really liked that Clerks movie.  He should have a go at a Marvel or DC Comics film, there would probably be more swearing.",Curious to dive deeper
1299," Yes that's the same Kevin Smith, a lot of his movies touch on comic books and super heroes in some way.",Curious to dive deeper
1299," It sounds like you know your Comic Book stuff, Nancy doesn't sound like your type of material.",Curious to dive deeper
1299,I've always been a fan of comic books. I prefer Marvel over DC comics personally,Curious to dive deeper
1299," Can't say I have an opinion, I really liked the Batman trilogy, but I think it was more to do with Christopher Nolan than the subject matter.",Curious to dive deeper
1299,I think that Nolan really transcended the problems DC has with adapting some of their franchises into movies.,Neutral
1299,Nolan should make an adaptation of the Nancy comic.  That would really upset some traditionalists.  It certainly wouldn't be simple then.,Curious to dive deeper
1299," That would definitely upset the traditionalists, a gritty noir Nancy movie would be quite the change of pace.",Neutral
1299,We should start a rumor on the internet.,Happy
1299,With the way the internet works these days I think it would spread like wildfire.,Happy
1299," Do you listen to music on the internet.  I know that is another thing some people get upset about.  They don't like Spotify, they think you should still use vinyl.",Curious to dive deeper
1299," I definitely use Spotify, even though Vinyl may give you the best sound, Spotify has a library that would cost you millions to recreate.",Curious to dive deeper
1299," I do use Spotify, especially when I want to hear a specific  track.  I mainly use the internet to listen to the radio.",Curious to dive deeper
1299,The ease and algorithms available online or through these apps are amazing.,Neutral
1299," Well it's time I left, have a good day.",Neutral
1300," hi, do you know much about us, the humans?",Curious to dive deeper
1300,I have had my DNA examined and have a Bit of neanderthal in me.  Erect posture is one of our traits.,Neutral
1300,yup we have come a long way. too bad we still cannot synthesize vitamin c?,Curious to dive deeper
1300," I know!  But I take it daily.  I think our use of language is wonderful, even though I have read that dogs can understand up to 1000 words.",Neutral
1300,Nice. I guess for now we stick to buying lemons and making lemonade,Curious to dive deeper
1300," Unfortunately, I always order tea and water without lemons since studies have shown that 40% of lemons in restaurants have fecal matter on the skin.  Yuk!!  Humans use of tools is also distinctive.",Neutral
1300," oh no, that is no good. the cool thing is we can grow our ribs in 2-3 months",Curious to dive deeper
1300,True.  Also we are the best of all animals at persistent hunting.  No other animals run marathons!,Neutral
1300,Yeah I guess that remains from our days of being hunter gatheres,Curious to dive deeper
1300," No doubt.  There is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans.  Years ago my wife took me to see ""The Exorcist"" without any warning about what it was about.  I think I heard that frightful frequency!",Neutral
1300,Oh my that must have been really scary then. did you know babies spontaneously dance to music?,Curious to dive deeper
1300," No, but I can understand it.  Even stoic people in my church start moving to certain beats.  There are lots of categories of dance!",Neutral
1300," yeah, I am a fan of tango and cha-cha. how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1300,I like the Argentine Tango because of the lifts and the relationship implied by the dance.   I was shocked to learn that Tupac dance ballet and played the Mouse Kind in The Nutcracker.,Neutral
1300," yeah I know, and Bruce Lee won a cha-cha competition once",Curious to dive deeper
1300,Surprise dancers seem to abound!  I love to watch capable people do that!,Neutral
1300,Yes me too. did you know ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of shoes a week?,Curious to dive deeper
1300,That is costly.  I wonder why they can't make more durable yet flexible shoes?,Neutral
1300," Not sure, it is a tough type of dance though. have you seen the movie the incredibles?",Curious to dive deeper
1300," I saw Incredibles, but not Incredibles 2.  Those characters. by Pixar are quite entertaining.",Neutral
1300," Very much so , I loved it too. nice chat",Happy
1301,Do you like learning about the universe?,Neutral
1301," Hi, Oh I love it!! ",Happy
1301,I mean it includes earth on which we live,Neutral
1301," sure, did you know there are cold stars?",Happy
1301,Ya I wonder how it would be like to see and touch one,Neutral
1301," Wow it has to be amazing. i really admire people like Copernicus, Isaac Newton and more who have studied the universe and we have been able to learn from them!",Happy
1301,I wonder if we will every truly know all there is to know in the universe,Curious to dive deeper
1301," I hope so, because there are many questions, like the size of the universe, the number of galaxies, stars and to know what is beyond the visible universe!",Happy
1301,I also wonder if there is any other life out there,Neutral
1301," And the thing is that without leaving our planet, there is so many things to learn about our earth.. to learn about its inclination, why is important, about gravity  and the magnetic field among many other things",Happy
1301,Well there is a theory that technically gravity doesn't exist,Neutral
1301,Well there are many theories out there... but actually the earth's gravity interacts with the moon and the sun.. we can see evidence of the gravity's interaction with the moon,Happy
1301," Well I mean the force of gravity does exist, but as a consequence of indents in space due to dense mass, like the mattress example",Neutral
1301," Interesting!! well let me tell you I want to travel and get to know as many different, seas, mountains, lakes and rivers!! That is my favorite thing to do.. what about you?",Happy
1301,Traveling is an amazing hobby that I too enjoy. Learning about this vast earth so full of life and wonder is always fun,Neutral
1301,Yes and no place is like any other!! I also want to visit every island there exists! and even the Antartic,Happy
1301,I do as well but I am hesitant to go to places that are too dangerous.,Neutral
1301," that is right, there is always a need to be careful but try to control the fear!  by the way did you know there is a sound frequency that makes  a person feel fear?",Happy
1301,That blew my mind,Surprised
1301,I bet they use it for horror movies!! Well there is a lot to learn about us as humans.. I really love to talk about science!,Happy
1301,Indeed. I really enjoyed our chat. Thanks for blowing my mind and for this chat.,Neutral
1301," Well I enjoyed too, have a good one!!",Happy
1302,Hello. Do you like to dance? I do not dance but I enjoy watching dance performances.,Curious to dive deeper
1302," Yes I like to watch dancing but I don't really dance, did you know that a ballet dancer can go through four pairs of shoes a week by the way",Surprised
1302,I heard about it.  It's really amazing.  It must cost them a lot of money.,Surprised
1302,Yes I think so. It's all so crazy that Tupac was a hardcore rapper but he also did ballet in high school haha,Surprised
1302,I cannot imagine him doing it.  Perhaps he wanted to meet pretty ladies!,Happy
1302," Well I couldn't blame him! I also can't blame babies for dancing to music, apparently they will smile and move to the beat when they hear a song",Happy
1302,That's cute.  I will want to watch my grand baby do it. Too bad she lives in another state.,Happy
1302,Yeah that is too bad. What do you think about Bruce Lee though? Do you know he was actually a great dancer,Curious to dive deeper
1302," No, I did not know that.  He was so talented in many ways.",Sad
1302," Yes he actually won a Cha Cha Championship back in 1958, on a different subject have you ever seen the movie Incredibles 2?",Curious to dive deeper
1302," No, I have not.  Please tell me about it.",Curious to dive deeper
1302," Well I saw the movie but I didn't like it as much as the first one, came out last year and Samuel L Jackson actually does a voice in it, I think he's pretty cool",Neutral
1302,I like Samuel L Jackson.  Is he in both Incredibles?,Happy
1302," Yes he is. If you watch the movies though it's crazy because they actually take place in the 60s, and they are not in present day",Neutral
1302,I see.  I'm curious to see them though since I can relate to the 60s. I'm old.,Curious to dive deeper
1302," Well you might like the movie then haha, it's crazy that the first movie came out back in 2004, doesn't seem like it was that long ago",Surprised
1302,Do you know that Brad Bird intentionally used artists who were likely to either quit of be fired from Pixar?,Curious to dive deeper
1302," No I didn't know that. I wonder if they worked harder because they were going to be fired then haha. What do you think about the fact that there was actually a sequel to the original Incredibles movie? But it was in video game for him, I never heard about that before",Surprised
1302," No, I have not heard about that.  Please tell me about it.",Curious to dive deeper
1302,I don't know I never played the video game. But apparently it was the sequel before the sequel that came out last year haha. I'll have to check it out.,Neutral
1302,I do not play video games anymore.  Are you familiar with Sarah Vowell?,Curious to dive deeper
1302,Betting sounds familiar. I think she does a voice in Incredibles 2 right? Maybe outside of that she is also a political commentator?,Neutral
1302," She is the voice of Violet Parr.  You are right, she is a political commentator.  Anyway, I've got to go now, my granddaughter is calling me.  It was nice chatting with you.  Good night.",Happy
1302," Yes nice chatting with you too, and she is also apparently a bestselling author, I'll checkout her work take care!",Happy
1303,Hi are you a hockey fan?,Curious to dive deeper
1303," Ya, you betcha. Give me a puck and a stick and you'll have a southerner trying to figure which end is up... You?",Happy
1303,Hahahah Nice! I'm the same way.  An average pro hockey player will lose up to 8 pounds per game.,Happy
1303,That explains why so many international hockey players are so fit! I saw in Sports Illustrated,Happy
1303,Ha!  An ice hockey ring remains under a basketball court when switching stadium sports.  That has to be a pain in the butt changing the floor.,Happy
1303," And I thought changing a diaper was tough... You know, hockey rinks used to only have one penalty box... But since fights would just continue in the box, teams lobbied for two boxes  to preserve teeth.",Happy
1303,LOL ...to preserve teeth! Awesome! lol  A hockey player was traded for $1 in 1993 and he went on to win four Stanley Cups.  I have no idea what his name was.,Happy
1303," Hockey players could use every cup they can get... In 1932, the USA Olympic hockey team lost to that hockey powerhouse, India",Happy
1303," LOL In 1924 the first Ollympic games, Canada scored 132 goals and let in only 3 during the entire competition.  They weren't playing around.",Happy
1303," Canadians are serious about their hockey!  Sometimes, the games get so hot, goalies spontaneously combust.  It happened once when puck hit a pack of matches in a goalie's pocket. Another reason I never smoked...",Happy
1303,That would have been funny to see.  Canada is the only country in the world with 2 national sports hockey and lacrosse. lol,Happy
1303," Nice. Not nice enough to make me want to be Canadian, but it is good that they have at least one thing to boast about!  Like the New England high school hockey team that beat the woman's USA Olympic team...",Happy
1303,lol  Are you a basketball fan?  I am...my favorite shot is the granny shot.,Happy
1303," In Texas, the Granny bow-hunting season starts in March. But Texans are proud of their Spurs, and that Tim Duncan!  He sacrificed money to stay in college for 4 years before dominating in the NBA!",Happy
1303,Nice!  Physicists probed that shoot granny style is the absolute best technique to consistently score points from the free throw line.  That's why it's my shot.  I'm too short to get anywhere close to the hoop when the game is on.,Happy
1303," Sounds like you still got game!  Sadly, most NBA players are broke just 5 years after they retire from the game. ",Happy
1303," Isn't that incredible they can blow through that money?  Allen Iverson will never have to worry about it after he signed that big endorsement deal with Reebok that pays him $800,000 a year until he reaches 55 and then at that time he will receive a final lump sum payment of $32 million bucks!",Happy
1303," He's right there with Jordan...a dude so good, the Miami Heat, a team he only played against, retired Michael's Jersey number when Jordan retired. That's respect!   ",Happy
1303,I never knew that.  Air Jordans were banned by the NBA.  Jordan wore them anyways because Nike was willing to pay the fine each game.  It's been fun chatting!,Happy
1303,And now Jordan is principle owner of the Hornets!  Thanks. I have enjoyed chatting with you too!,Happy
1303,Have a great night!,Happy
1304," Hello, in Sweden it is illegal to name your kid metallica! That is dumb.",Surprised
1304,hey! That's funny. I'm listening similar to Metallica music right now. Do you watch NBA?,Neutral
1304,No but I do watch other basketball games sometimes. I did read that air Jordan's were banned in the NBA for a bit/,Curious to dive deeper
1304,What surprise me about NBA is the fact that 60% of players within 5 years of retirement are broke. In NFL it is even bigger - 78%. That's terrible number.,Surprised
1304," No way! They get paid tons. It surprised me that there are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states, I didn't know they were a registered thing.",Surprised
1304,I guess it relates to family and not so many of players have really good families. Do you watch superhero movies?,Neutral
1304," Yes somewhat, I've actually heard about the superman called ""normal-man"" before even reading this.",Happy
1304," Where did you heard about ""Normal-man""? I'm trying to pay attention, but never even heard of him hahaha",Surprised
1304,He was a super-hero with no powers at all.,Curious to dive deeper
1304," Yes, that's funny. I guess 30 superhero is really too much. This is why there is ""normal-man"". This industry just want to make a lot of money!",Curious to dive deeper
1304,I'm guessing that too. Did you know Dwight Howard wore a Superman undershirt and cape during one of his games to get the nickname superman?,Curious to dive deeper
1304," No, I didn't know. I like him in NBA.",Neutral
1304,Well he's had many battles against the wizards over the past years.,Curious to dive deeper
1304," Yes, I guess too many. Do you have favorite NBA team?",Neutral
1304," No I wouldn't say I did, do you?",Curious to dive deeper
1304,Not really. I more interested in particular players and enjoy how they play. Team name isn't really important for me. It would be fun to see a version of superman where superman was raised in Soviet Union. It sounds funny!,Happy
1304,Why the soviet union? He would starve to death.,Curious to dive deeper
1304,Maybe this life made him stronger hahaha,Neutral
1304," I guess so, well did you know DC Comics paid only $130 in 1938 for rights to Superman?",Curious to dive deeper
1304," I didn't know it, but it could be. You never know the future and $130 in 1928 were large money.",Neutral
1304,Thank you for the conversation.,Happy
1304,Thanks. Have a great day!,Neutral
1305," Hello, are you a superhero fan? if you are then you might find interesting that there are over 300 hereos registered in the US.",Surprised
1305," not really but i am familiar.  i think it is funny that you cannot name your kid metallica, superman, or veranda in sweden.",Surprised
1305," I did not know that, well I would name my kid like that, it would be messed up lol.",Curious to dive deeper
1305,So this is crazy and I had no idea.  Alan Iverson signed a lifetime deal with Reebok.  he gets $800k a year until the age of 55 and then gets $32M lump sum payment.  i am guessing Reebok regrets that.,Surprised
1305," Thats a lot of money, they sure regret it  although I think his had some decent seasons lately. There is a player that was known as Superman.",Surprised
1305," yes, Dwight Howard calls himself Superman.  sounds like he is looking to sign with the Washington Wizards.",Curious to dive deeper
1305," I think he would be a good hire, I think Dwight Howard is a great player with a lot of experience. ",Happy
1305," He is not a good free throw shooter though, 56.6% is very poor for a pro basketball player.   And he picked up his 16th technical foul last season and was fined $60k and given a one game suspension.",Surprised
1305," Yeah, it seems like free throws are his kryptonite, I think that he is a bet that could turn better than expected, he has the motivation to comeback.",Surprised
1305," Speaking of Superman, DC Comics paid $130 in 1938 for the exclusive rights.  good investment.",Surprised
1305," I bet the party that sold the rights regret it to this day, considering Superman is one of the most popular heroes.",Surprised
1305,I would think so.  that $130 was probably wasted.  Superman once wielded Thors hammer as he was the only one deemed worthy.  lol,Surprised
1305," I thought Vision was also one of the worthy ones,did you know that there is a comic series about the collateral damaged caused by superheroes.",Happy
1305,that would be a crappy job.  fixing everyone's crap...  there is a lso a superhero called NormalMan.  i am wondering what is super about being normal.,Surprised
1305," Thats odd, I heard his the only hero without powers in a planet full with heroes, he must have other skills.",Curious to dive deeper
1305," maybe, but what would be normal about him then.  haha  Dwight Howard should shoot Granny style as physicists have proven this to be the best technique  Like Rick Barry",Curious to dive deeper
1305," It is ironic lol, and yeah, maybe changing his technique will help him, I think he has a lot of talent and with inspiration he can be the player he once was.",Happy
1305,i did not know that Air Jordans were banned from the NBA.  but Michael Jordan wore them anyway and Nike paid his fines.,Angry
1305,Do you happen to know why they got banned_,Surprised
1305,no  apparerntly were banned when they forst came out.  probably because they were for a current player i would guess.,Surprised
1305,I imagine some players got injured from using them or maybe they werent fully tested.,Curious to dive deeper
1306," Do you follow, or know much about hockey?",Curious to dive deeper
1306," Hi, I live in Florida, so not too much of a hockey fan.  I've seen a couple of games and it seems very aggressive at times.",Surprised
1306," Florida does not seem like your typical hockey place, but then again, neither does Washington DC",Curious to dive deeper
1306,Are you a big fan?,Curious to dive deeper
1306," Not really, actually from Europe where if you say hockey most people will think of field hockey.  ",Neutral
1306," Didn't realize that, when I hear hockey, I think ice hockey.  But, neither is really popular where I live. Lol",Surprised
1306," So I understand the Washington team is called the Capitals, and the stadium is sponsored by Capital One, coincidence?",Curious to dive deeper
1306," I'm sure they pay very well, to get the honor of  calling them the Capitals.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1306," How about basketball, is that more of your thing?",Curious to dive deeper
1306," Yes, I love basketball.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1306," Again it is a bit of a blind spot for me, I seem to have lots of blind spots.  Maybe I should get my eyes tested.",Sad
1306," That's ok,  have you ever heard of the great Michael Jordan?",Curious to dive deeper
1306," Yes, I know the basics, not completely blind.   I even know of the Miami Heat, I live in the Cleveland area and recall the shirt burning when LeBron took his talents there. ",Sad
1306," See there, I knew you must know some about basketball!  Some people say Lebron James is the greatest player of all time, but I think Michael Jordan is the greatest!",Curious to dive deeper
1306," I've lived a time in DC, I recall when Jordan came out of retirement for a couple of years there, not at his peak but still better than most.",Happy
1306," I never knew he was so superstitious, though.  Apparently, he wore his North Carolina shorts under his uniform, believing they brought him luck.  ",Surprised
1306," Whatever gets you going.  It's funny when you hear players talk of their rituals, some eat the same thing, or do the same things.  No one can say it did not work for Jordan.",Curious to dive deeper
1306," Exactly!  e was well respected, by all.  I hear the Miami Heat retired Number 23 in his honor, for the years he played against them.  What an honor.",Surprised
1306,That is an honor.  Would Miami be your team being from Florida?  They had some glory years not that long ago.,Curious to dive deeper
1306," No, actually I'm a Golden State Warrior fan, I grew up in California.  Do you have a favorite team?",Curious to dive deeper
1306," I really admire the Warriors as a successful team, I should support the Cavaliers as they are the nearest team, or the Wizards as I lived there.  The closest to a favorite would be the Spurs, I always liked Duncan.",Neutral
1306,,Happy
1306," Well have a good day, good bye.",Neutral
1307,Do you enjoy sports?,Neutral
1307," It depends on the sport, I used to be a gymnast, and think it's cool that the ancient Greeks practiced it for war.",Neutral
1307," I feel that despite its image, it is a very difficult sport",Neutral
1307,Despite it's image? it's not know for being a lazy sport. Even the pommel horse was originally developed for soldiers.,Neutral
1307," I mean I understand it is an intense sport that requires endurance, strength, coordination, and flexibility to say the least, but it isn't one of the sports that come to mind as being dangerous or I guess tough like rugby or football",Neutral
1307," Tough? I guess it's how you look at it. Ballers have it easier than gymnasts There was even a gymnast with a wooden leg, he even won six medals in one day.",Surprised
1307,It is amazing how nadia comaneci scored the first 10 in history,Neutral
1307," She was only 14, and the scoreboard only went to 9.8.",Curious to dive deeper
1307,I wonder why it only went up to 9.8. Seems odd,Curious to dive deeper
1307," That was the highest score at the time. There was a N.Korean gymnast who may have been 10 at the Barcelona Olympics, even though they said she was 17",Curious to dive deeper
1307,How was her performance?,Curious to dive deeper
1307,I don't know. I don't remember her. I was surprised to learn that a pro hockey player can lose 8 pounds in a game. That seems dangerous.,Curious to dive deeper
1307,I am not from the east so I hadn't skated till relatively later in my life and wow I burn calories struggles to just stand on ice. Can't imaging how much you burn playing hockey,Neutral
1307," I wonder how much you burn playing lacrosse? I'm surprised we don't have a national league, like Canada does.",Curious to dive deeper
1307,I am not to familiar with lacrosse. Could you tell me more about it?,Curious to dive deeper
1307,I don't understand it at all. It's not popular in my area. We do have an ice hockey rink with a basketball floor that covers it.,Curious to dive deeper
1307,Is the basketball floor on top of the ice?,Curious to dive deeper
1307," It's a cover for the ice rink. Like a sub floor. They are common with stadiums that don't have a lot of room, and both sports are played.",Curious to dive deeper
1307,Really? I never knew that. That is fascinating. I wonder if the basketball court feels cold when playing,Surprised
1307," I doubt it. In 1993, a hockey player was traded for $1. He went on to win four Stanley Cups.",Curious to dive deeper
1307," That was a steal for whichever team got him for a buck. In any case, thanks for chatting.",Neutral
1308,Interesting that a movie I love growing up was thought of as something that later became San Andreas. Twister was my all time favorite disaster movie.,Surprised
1308," Hah, I remember watching it as a kid in school for some odd reason.  I've never heard about the whole ""comps"" thing",Curious to dive deeper
1308,Straight Outta Compton looked interesting but I never had a chance to see it. I guess I should go and see it now.,Curious to dive deeper
1308,Not my thing.  I don't get the whole Mister Rogers thing.  I thought it was boring when I was a kid,Neutral
1308," I never watched those shows either, my brother tried to force me into watching them but it didn't stick. ",Neutral
1308," I liked the original teenage mutant ninja turtles when I was a kid.   I haven't heard of ""Three Identical Strangers"" have you?",Neutral
1308," Loved Ninja Turtles, and no I have not. Not sure what that is about. ",Surprised
1308," I might have to look it up.  That keeps happening with these hits, I get interested and have to look stuff up",Neutral
1308,Was Mr. Rogers a TV show? And Won't you be my neighbor based off it? I don't really remember. Surprised it made 22 million.,Surprised
1308,Yeah it was a PBS kids thing.  Won't you be my neighbor is a documentary about him/it,Neutral
1308," Ah! I was like what were you talking about, and then I saw the ""Won't You Be My Neighbors"" just wanted to be sure. ",Curious to dive deeper
1308,Pretty sure there is a move coming out with Tom Hanks playing him as well,Neutral
1308," Umm... Interesting. What is Hawke's first name? I've seen ""The Purge"" trailers, but never really watched it enough to know the names of the actors.",Curious to dive deeper
1308,Ethan Hawke.  Did you see that part about Stephen King being terrified as a child by the movie Bambi?,Curious to dive deeper
1308," Yes I did, I never thought much about it. Although, he was such an intelligent man so he probably understood life more than we did. And Bambi was a sweet movie. ",Surprised
1308," But the mother dying is sad, but one or both parents were almost always killed in Disney movies",Neutral
1308," Yeah, it was poor Bambi even if he wasn't real.Shocking how very few people are getting mad at the deaths, yet they get mad at the other things involved with the movies. ",Neutral
1308," Right, it seems like its always sex that upsets people, not violence",Neutral
1308,Sigh. What a strange world we live in. Speaking of which. Jack Black as the star of Green Lantern now that's a laugh.,Disgusted
1308," Hopefully the would have had him get in shape before putting on the spandex.  And hey, watching a horror movie burns 180 calories!",Curious to dive deeper
1308," Oh yeah, well it was going to be a comedy, I'd doubt it would of been as action packed as it was when it was created had they went with Jack Black. ",Neutral
1308," Who was it, Ryan Reynolds?",Curious to dive deeper
1308,Yes it was.,Happy
1308," I might have to look up what a waterphone is as well, never heard of it",Curious to dive deeper
1308," I don't know what a waterphone is either, sounds interesting. ",Curious to dive deeper
1308,Nice talking to you,Neutral
1309,Do you like any of the movies that came out in the summer of 2018>,Happy
1309,I did! Do you watch movies?,Surprised
1309,Yes.  I love them.  They are a good way to pass time in the winter months.,Happy
1309,Very True. Have you seen Black Panther?,Curious to dive deeper
1309," I did.  Great movie.  I love those movies.  They just added a great superhero spinoff ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" on Netflix.",Happy
1309,I might have to look that up! Black panther is the richest super hero to date though!,Surprised
1309,I remember seeing that somewhere.  The symbols and written script from that movie are based on an actual script called nsibdi.,Happy
1309,Really? I had no idea! I was surprised that Black panther was worth more. I thought Tony stark might be.,Surprised
1309,Tony Stark is worth $100 billion.  Black Panther crushed him bringing in $500 billion.  Whoa!  That's a huge difference.,Happy
1309,It is! and Bruce wayne only brought $80 billion!,Curious to dive deeper
1309,Who would have thought?  That franchise is the oldest and has been around for decades. Do you like comedies?  I love them.  Bill Burray thinks Kung Fu Hustle is the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comeday.,Happy
1309," He's weird. When Black panther came out, I was really surprised they called it that because of the black panther political party.",Surprised
1309,LOL  Weren't they going to call the character Black Leopard?,Happy
1309,I think it was! So many of us were like they are calling it Black panther? Kinda like when they came out with Soylent.,Surprised
1309,Yes.  Do you like Stephen King?  He calls Bambi the first horror movie he saw.  That's kind of weird.,Happy
1309,Bambi really is a horror show. I kinda feel that way about Watership down myself. I loved the Mist though.,Surprised
1309,I think they have a new version of,Happy
1309,Already! do you like comedies?,Surprised
1309,Yes.  It's on Netflix I think.  I love comedies.  I used to love watching 3rd Rock from the Sun back in the 90s.  It won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997.,Happy
1309,I love thrid rock from the sun! So much fun!,Surprised
1309,It was great chatting with you!,Happy
1309,You too!,Curious to dive deeper
1309,Have a good day!,Happy
1310," Hello, How are you? Do you enjoy watching movies?",Curious to dive deeper
1310," Yea, I enjoy the Marvel films, I still have to catch 2018's Black Panther though",Neutral
1310," Yes, I like Marvel too! I haven't seen Black Panther either. Seems like the summer time is a time for Documentaries too!",Curious to dive deeper
1310,Recently there have been some non-fiction movies like Hidden Figures and Straight Outta Compton released during the summer,Neutral
1310," True, I'm sure there will be a list of new ones coming out this year! I really enjoy Comedy!  Did you know Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 of their shows?",Surprised
1310,No that's a lot! Did you know the trope of slipping on a banna peel was a reference to slipping on horse poop?,Curious to dive deeper
1310,What? that's crazy!! lol Do you like Jack Black? He's pretty funny guy. He was suppose to play in the Green Lantern film.,Surprised
1310," I had no idea, kinda strange, so was The Empire Strikes Back being nominated as best comedy by the writers guild",Surprised
1310," Really, I didn't know that was a comedy movie? Interesting",Surprised
1310," I never though Empire was a comedy, maybe it was because of the ewoks ",Surprised
1310," Yeah, or its a writer guild thing. Who knew? That was a really good movie though!! Loved it!",Curious to dive deeper
1310," Yea, it's a shame a comedy film hasn't won best picture in 37 years",Sad
1310," Is that right? Really, I am surprised as well! Are you into Horror films? I can watch some.",Curious to dive deeper
1310,I really find the macabre and supernatural themes interesting and will watch horror movies focused on that. Not a big slasher/gore fan at all,Neutral
1310," Yes, I agree, If its slasher/gore I won't watch that. I saw Bambi as a child and got upset when the mother died. Stephen King thinks that was his first horror film!",Surprised
1310," That's nuts, E.T was originally scripted as a horror movie, that would of messed kids up too",Surprised
1310," lol, I agree!  I loved ET! I didn't upset with that, but I was much older. Have you ever heard of the waterphone that makes all the creepy sounds in horror films?",Curious to dive deeper
1310," Yea, such an iconic instrument. Did you know the filmers of the Exorcist didn't consider it a horror movie?",Curious to dive deeper
1310," Oh no, now that is crazy!!! When I watch the very first Exorcist, just the beginning music and scenes makes me want to run out of the room. I know what's coming!! My husband use to laugh at me but the music sounds so evil.",Fearful
1310," Yea, the Exorcist is so scary, maybe the filmmakers thought it transcended a horror movie",Neutral
1310,Could be. We go to the Halloween Horror Nights every year at Universal and I'm pretty sure they use that waterphone in those haunted houses!! Good chat!!,Fearful
1310,Have a good one,Neutral
1311,I am so saddened to hear about the van accident that caused 10 deaths in Toronto.,Sad
1311," Yes, it was quite a tragedy, and caused a number of safety measures to be implemented.",Sad
1311,I'm glad they observed a moment of silence. It's important to recognize that life is more than sports.,Happy
1311," True, but sports help too, and it is good the Stanley Cup game continued as planned.",Happy
1311," The fans needed the distraction and sports do bring people together. It's too bad that a tragedy has to happen for us to see a need to change security measures, but we can't always anticipate tragedy.",Sad
1311,Too true.        What do they call that black disc they use in hockey?,Curious to dive deeper
1311," That would be the puc. Not much of a hockey fan, eh?",Surprised
1311,I am more familiar with field hockey!,Happy
1311," I see. I live in a part of the world with a lot of snow, so I'm more used to ice hockey. Canada is a powerhouse in ice hockey. Especially at the Olympics.",Neutral
1311," I know Canada is still one of the best, although in the early days of the Winter Olympics they really dominated!",Happy
1311,The 1924 Olympics was Canada's shining glory with 132 goals and their opponents only getting 3 during the entire competition.,Surprised
1311," Well, what would you expect when it is a national sport!     Canada has another sport at that level, don't they?",Happy
1311,Yeah. Their other national sport is lacrosse.,Neutral
1311,Interesting.   I've always found multiple sports venues fascinating.,Happy
1311,It is pretty nifty that they can have a basketball floor on top of a hockey rink.,Surprised
1311," Yes, quite an engineering feat!    Are you a fan of the nba?",Happy
1311," The NBA is fun to watch, but I have to admit I like less professional basketball team play like college. I am always amazed though by great talents like Reggie Miller.",Neutral
1311,OK.    I would've loved to be a fly on the wall for his matches against his sister Cheryl.,Surprised
1311,No kidding. Breaking 8 national records is no small thing.,Surprised
1311," Still not Michael Jordan, who was so good that Nike would pay per game fines because his shoes were not approved for game use.",Surprised
1311,It's just a bit crazy when you have to have your shoes approved to play. I can't believe that physicists proved that Granny shots are the best technique for consistent free throws.,Surprised
1311," I've tried it, but never been able to master the underhand thing!    Perhaps I will go practice.   Thanks for the chat!",Happy
1312,Good morning!  Did you know that the White House has twin buildings in Ireland and France?,Happy
1312,I did not. I know there's a replica of the White House in Atlanta that was built as a private home though.,Surprised
1312,Wow!  I didn't know that.  For some reasonTeddy Roosevelt once banned christmas trees from the white house.,Happy
1312,What a scrooge! Jimmy Carter seemed like someone who wanted to save money. During the winter of 1977 he turned down the white house thermostats to 65 degrees.,Curious to dive deeper
1312,lol  That,Happy
1312,He also had solar panels on the white house...then Ronald Reagan had them removed.,Surprised
1312,That's interesting!  Sorry I hit the return button before.  The white house still uses floppy disks for storing files.  That seems kind of old technology now.,Happy
1312," Yeah it is, I wonder if they have a surplus of them, because I can't remember the last time I've even seen a floppy disc.",Surprised
1312,Me too.  I haven't even seen any being sold at garage sales.  Did you know taht 86 percent of the land in Nevada is owned by the government?  That's incredible.,Happy
1312," That is pretty wild, I guess that equates to all the military bases and test sites out there.",Surprised
1312,Makes sense.  In 2008 the Norwegian government donated 1 billion to help save the Amazon rainforest.  That's a lot of cash.  Hopefully it helped.,Happy
1312,It would be nice if our government did something like that. Our government just likes to shut down. It's happened 17 times over the past 37 years. It even happened 3 times in 1977!,Surprised
1312,I agree.  I wonder if anything would have been different if Hillary got elected?  I don't think the president has much control over the economy.,Happy
1312,I wonder that myself. It's funny that she used to be a Republican. I wonder what made her change?,Curious to dive deeper
1312," I wonder that myself.  She won a grammy for best spoken word album for here book ""It takes a Village"".  ",Happy
1312," Oh wow, I find it funny that she rejected Bill's marriage proposals for two years before finally agreeing to marry him. I guess his persistence paid off.",Surprised
1312,lol  That's the funny!  She would adopt a southern drawl while she was campaigning the southern states.,Happy
1312,I hate that! I'm from the south and hate fake southern accents more than I hate our regular accents.,Disgusted
1312,lol  I'm a fan of southern accents  Northern accents are just plain and boring I think.,Happy
1312," I agree, I live close to the Gulf so my town gets a lot of ""snow birds"" so I have a mixture of both.",Curious to dive deeper
1312," I bet the snow birds are a pain in the butt.  lol  Although probably good for the local economy like restaurants, etc.",Happy
1312," Yeah they definitely help keep restaurants in business during the winter. I won't go to most of the beach restaurants during the summer because they're so crowded, but it's nice during the off season.",Surprised
1312,I bet it does get crowded.  Well it was nice chatting with you.  Have a good morning!  :),Happy
1312,Thanks! I hope you do too!,Neutral
1313,Good Morning-what do you think of Ivanka using the government e-mail,Curious to dive deeper
1313,Ivanka should be careful about using gov't email. I think that Clinton ran into some problems because of email.,Neutral
1313,I think they should find out what Clinton did and prosecute her if need be. They have been talking about it since the election and nothing has been done! Ivanka should be careful not to get into that mess.,Angry
1313," She is immune to criticism, just like Trump. I don't know what her political aspirations are, but as long as her father is there, she will benefit from his presence.",Neutral
1313," But she doesn't want to be seen to doing something totally wrong, like Hillary did.",Angry
1313," She probably won't run for president. If she does, this whole incident will be ancient history by then. New scandals will be floating around.",Neutral
1313,Can't these people behave themselves? I don't like the Clintons and their scandals and it just gets worse. It seems like they think they can get away with anything!,Curious to dive deeper
1313,I hear you. The media love scandals because lurid stories draw viewers. Recently Jeff Bezos was in a scandal. I wonder if he'll ever run for the White House.,Neutral
1313," God help us I hope not! I don't think he would be elected. I think that Joe Biden has the best shot because he has been there the longest. But of course, I am a Trump fan, so I hope they all move to another country.",Fearful
1313," Biden is probably too old at this point. The Democratic field is a jumble, and I don't know who is going to finally emerge as the candidate. Trump is already campaigning.",Neutral
1313," No, they don't actually have a good candidate. Too much scandal behind most of them. People don't seem to care, though.",Fearful
1313," It's going to be an interesting race. People shift allegiances to suit the situation. For example, Clinton used to be a republican and Ric used to be a democrat.",Neutral
1313," Yes, they are like chameleons. Change colors to suit their purpose. I like Reagan-but that was a long time ago. The world was more peaceful then.",Sad
1313,I'm wondering about a possible gov't shutdown. The government has shut down 17 times over the past 37 years. it happened three times in 1977.,Neutral
1313," I think Trump will shut it down if he doesn't get the funding for the Wall. I think he should at least get rid of Pelosi while he is in office. She, and some of the other old politicians, need to retire. I wonder if Justice Ginsburg is even still alive? No one has seen her at all. So, I don't blame Trump if he shuts it down out of frustration with these people.",Neutral
1313," He doesn't have the power to get rid of Pelosi. She has her position because of the Congressional majority. If the GOP gets a majority again, they can put in their own person. I wonder if Rupert Murdoch will support a Democrat this time. He has apparently supported both hillary clinton and barack obama in campaign elections.",Neutral
1313," Politicians should have term limits. Trump should at least help pass a law to that effect. Rupert Murdoch, the Clintons, the Koch brothers and Soros (to name a few) I do not agree with their views ",Neutral
1313," I'm not sure what grounds you can jail them. Rich people usually have the money to get lawyers to avoid jail. The system needs to be overhauled, that's for sure, but it's not as bad as China. The Chinese government has censored the word 'censorship' That's extreme.",Neutral
1313," In some other countries around the world, they wold have lost their heads by now. I know that it is not possible here but it is what should actually happen in a better world where treasonous agents are punished for the troubles they foment.",Disgusted
1313," Well, I enjoyed chatting with you! Have a good day!",Happy
1313," You also, thank you for your insight.",Neutral
1313,Best of luck!,Neutral
1313,You too!,Neutral
1313,Thanks!,Neutral
1313,welcome,Happy
1314," Hello, do you follow politics?",Curious to dive deeper
1314,I do a little bit!  I know that wikileaks published the government's plans to destroy wikileaks.,Happy
1314,That's pretty funny. I saw that the white house has twin buildings in Ireland and France.,Surprised
1314,I never knew that!  I know George W. Bush had solar panels put back on the white house.,Happy
1314,That's smart. I'm glad he did that.,Happy
1314,Yes.  Wish I could put solar panels on my house and get away from having to pay the electric company.  Teddy Roosevelt was such a staunch conservationist that he banned Christmas trees from the white house!,Happy
1314,I agree. That's pretty funny about Roosevelt. Did you know the white house uses floppy disks for storing some files?,Surprised
1314," I didn't.  Think they would have upgraded by now.  lol  On Nov. 11, 2011 someone shot bullets at the white house and it took the secret service 4 days to realize it. Wow!",Surprised
1314,I would think so too lol. Hard to believe it took them 4 days to figure that out!,Surprised
1314,I know right?  Kind of scary it took them that long.,Surprised
1314,I agree. Did you know 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the government,Surprised
1314,Wow.  I didn't know that.  The other 14 percent must be casinos? lol,Happy
1314,Haha probably. The Norwegian government donated 1 billion to help save the Amazon rain forests.,Surprised
1314," That's a lot of cash!  A man in France impersonated a gov't official and managed to sell the Eiffel Tower not once, but twice!  lol",Happy
1314,That's hilarious! Wonder if he was arrested and charged for that?,Curious to dive deeper
1314,I bet he was!  How could he not?  lol  Are you a fan of Hillary Clinton?,Happy
1314,I do not like her at all. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
1314,I'm not a fan.   Hillary was the president of young republicans in college.  Funny how she switched sides.,Happy
1314,That's pretty ironic she flipped parties lol.,Surprised
1314," I know right?  She has a grammy award for best spoken word album for the audio recording of her book ""It takes a village"".",Happy
1314,It was good talking to you!,Happy
1315," Hi, how are you?",Happy
1315,Hello - good how are you?,Curious to dive deeper
1315," I am good. I am excited to dive deeper into the ocean, pun intended!",Curious to dive deeper
1315,I agree lol. Did you know the alternative name for the planet is tellus and telluris?,Happy
1315,I did not know that. I think I will be using thsoe terms more!,Curious to dive deeper
1315,I saw that in 1975 the Soviet Union sent a space craft to the planet Venus. Pretty amazing.,Curious to dive deeper
1315,I wonder how it is holding up. The Societ Union's technology at that time couldn't have been good...,Happy
1315," I agree. Apparently, they captured the very first images of Venus.",Surprised
1315," Really? That's a little shocking... considering we beat them into space but since got the moon, they probably didn't want to go there again and chose Venus.",Curious to dive deeper
1315,I also read that you could fit every other planet between Earth and the moon which is pretty amazing.,Surprised
1315," Yeah, conisdering the size of Jupiter! Have you ever been diving? The author states ""Just 650 feet down..."" That's so far down!!!!",Curious to dive deeper
1315," I have never been diving, but I'd really like to try it. I do know that 650 feet is very far down!",Surprised
1315,Yeah. On my first dive I went like 75 and freaked out! I ran out of oxygen so quickly... I'm a little better now...,Sad
1315,Oh wow that's crazy! Did you know that since jellyfish are 98% water they would evaporate in the sun?,Surprised
1315,That makes sense but it's still a little surprising.I read there is a jelly fish that is immortal. I gotta know more about that...,Curious to dive deeper
1315,lol I've read that too. There's a specific species of jellyfish that never dies. It basically keeps regrowing new cells it's entire life.,Curious to dive deeper
1315,I could use that for the bags under my eyes! And my face in general!!!!,Happy
1315,hahaha! I also saw that there is a fish called the barreleye that has a completely transparent head which is creepy.,Surprised
1315,HAHAHA. Can you imagine a human with a transparent head? Walking down a busy street in NYC and there's a dude with a transparent head? So weird!,Happy
1315,LOL that would be hilarious! Being able to see their brain and stuff.,Happy
1315,Nice chatting with you!,Happy
1316,Have you ever visited Washington DC?,Curious to dive deeper
1316," Good morning, yes, I have when I was a kid I visited D.C. on a school trip.  Have you?",Curious to dive deeper
1316," No I have not but would like to some day, were you able to notice that the guest house is actually bigger than the White House?",Curious to dive deeper
1316," No, I don't think we visited the  ""guest house""  but, I was pretty shocked to see the White House isn't all that big.  I've seen private homes around my town that are much larger than it.",Surprised
1316," Oh wow, it does look quite ""grand"" on TV but if they're still using floppy disks to store files, I'm sure much of the other things are pretty outdated as well.",Surprised
1316," That's funny, I can't believe they are still using the floppies.  I would think that would be a security risk.",Surprised
1316," A huge security risk or maybe not considering how backwards it is and no one has access to those things except the government, I suppose.",Neutral
1316," That's true, it may be pretty smart on their part. Did you know it took the secret service 4 days to determine the White House had been struck by bullets on November 11, 2011?",Surprised
1316," That's crazy! I wonder why it took them that long to do that, but then again, a man in France impersonated to be a government official and managed to sell the Eiffel Tower twice! Who were the buyers?!",Curious to dive deeper
1316," I know, wonder how they missed the bullets whizzing around? Amazing, they could get away with selling the tower, not once but twice!",Surprised
1316,Exactly! That's like selling the Statue of Liberty! Someone might have done it or gotten close like that man and it might even be in Wikileaks which the government plans to destroy.,Surprised
1316,I had heard that Wikileaks had published the government's plans to destroy it! You never know what the government is up to.  Did you realize they own 86% of the land in Nevada.  What's going on out there?,Curious to dive deeper
1316," Exactly, perhaps we will find out in Wikileaks, but I wonder if the government owning that much land impacts real estate rates significantly, any ideas?",Curious to dive deeper
1316," Probably, drives the prices down, I would think.  Have you heard about the Norwegian government donating a billion dollars to help save the Amazon rainforest?",Curious to dive deeper
1316," That's very commendable, I wonder if the US has contributed to efforts like that but I don't think that is likely with the current president. What do you think?",Curious to dive deeper
1316," No, I'm sure Trump hasn't allowed any of that!  Things would surely have been different if Hillary had won the election.",Curious to dive deeper
1316," I think so too, but I didn't realize she had a Grammy to her name, it's for best spoken word album for a book, I didn't even know that was a category!",Surprised
1316," For the audio recording of her book, "" It Takes A Village"".  I didn't know there was such a category, either.",Surprised
1316," Yeah, I wonder if that category still exists. I wonder if Hilary Clinton will be running as the Deomcratic Party nominee for the next election?",Curious to dive deeper
1316," I think her time has passed, but the Democrats have really no clear front runner out of their pack out there now.",Disgusted
1316,I think Trump might take credit for setting that precedent sadly.,Neutral
1317," The ocean floor is really amazing, theres a lot we dont know about it",Curious to dive deeper
1317," I completely agree! I can't believe the Titanic is 12,000 feet underwater and that people have logged over 3,000 hours underwater and we still don't know much about it.",Surprised
1317," I think the ocean is a source of inspiration to many, me included, all the wonders that are there, all the wonders to discover",Curious to dive deeper
1317,I would love to see a picture of the bristlemouth fish with an alien mouth and bioluminescent parts of its body.,Neutral
1317," That would be great,  they are the most numerous vertebra in the planet and still they are so rare for us, ",Curious to dive deeper
1317,Did you know that part of the ocean is called the twilight zone and has the largest animal migration on Earth?,Curious to dive deeper
1317," I didnt know about that zone, but it must have a wide range of animals, some common other really rare, it seems like a dangerous place full with predators though",Curious to dive deeper
1317," Definitely, unfortunately I think we're the biggest predators. We use to think the ocean's resources were limitless, but that thinking with the Northwest Atlantic Cod Fishery almost killed a whole ecosystem.",Sad
1317," They kill a lot of species, so I guess they are the worse and that should stop- we should protect sea life. the ocean has also absorbed a lot of carbon dioxide",Angry
1317," There are so many things about the planet we don't understand! Even more we don't know about other planets, but I do no that Venus doesn't tilt so it has no seasons!",Neutral
1317," I agree theres a lot we dont know about astronomical bodies over the universe, and not only planets but also moons of planets, Venus must be a beautiful planet",Curious to dive deeper
1317,Yes the moons...did you know that if Jupiter's moon orbited the sun that it would be a planet?,Curious to dive deeper
1317," Yeah the moon is called Ganymede and it must be massive, Jupiter is also beautiful have you seen at the pictures of the storms, ",Curious to dive deeper
1317,I haven't! Did you know that when Earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long? That's crazy!,Surprised
1317," That is crazy, I would be really old by now lol, there is a planet where  shards of glass precipitate sideways at a really high speed",Curious to dive deeper
1317,That sounds scary! Did you know that we have an official ambassador to extraterrestrials in case they ever come?  I wonder what that person does every day?!,Surprised
1317," We do? that is crazy, I wonder if that will ever happen though, maybe martians will visit us some day",Curious to dive deeper
1317," Maybe. I didn't realize helium was as prevalent on Earth as it is, but Earth will be almost helium-free by the end of the 21st century.",Neutral
1317," I wonder how helium affects the planet, it seems like we can do ok without it",Curious to dive deeper
1317,I only knew about it in balloons lol! Another thing I recently found out is that the only fish with a neck is a seahorse.  Strange to think about!,Surprised
1317," It is strange, fish are also full with wonders, there is even an immortal breed of jellyfish",Curious to dive deeper
1318,Did you know that freshwater fish drink water through their skin through osmosis and saltwater fish drink water through their mouths?,Curious to dive deeper
1318," I did not know that! I think we imagine that the ocean's resources are infinite, but of course, we are running out of fish year by year.",Sad
1318," Sad, but true. Also, over 80% of our Earth's natural forest have already been destroyed, it's a shame.",Sad
1318,We have finite resources but infinite greed and desire. The Northwest Atlantic cod fishery is an object lesson in how we must preserve natural resources for future generations.,Curious to dive deeper
1318,Unfortunately greed will never go away. The fishery is a great lesson of preserving resources. Did you know that our seasons are produced by the Earth tilting during it's rotation?,Curious to dive deeper
1318," I didn't know that! I thought seasons were about distance from the sun, but I learned something today! The earth has alternative names, such as Gaia, Tellus and Telluris. Maybe I should give my kids some of these names.",Curious to dive deeper
1318,I learned something new today too!  Tellus and Telluris would be great names for boys.....don't know if the boys would like them though!,Neutral
1318," The Earth is the only planet in our solar system to support life. I think that maybe we will make it to Mars, but not much farther. We should probably do what we can to preserve this fragile planet of ours, at least until the aliens show up to help us.",Curious to dive deeper
1318," A Twilight Zone episode called ""To Serve Man"" comes to mind, Men thought the Aliens were here to help because their manual was called ""To Serve Man"", well when it was decoded, the men realized it was a cookbook!",Surprised
1318," Well, the aliens had no choice. We had eaten all the fish. We were the only species left worth eating. Have you heard of the barreleye fish? It has a transparent head. Probably a good conversation starter at parties.",Neutral
1318," Ha ha, never heard of it.  What a party starter that would be!  Did you know that Scientists once considered Pluto a planet but no longer do, I'm not sure why but I would love to find out why.",Happy
1318,Scientists need to have something to debate over lunch or else they would have to go back to their offices and write papers.,Neutral
1318,That's a great one!  So true!,Surprised
1318,Koi fish are long lived. One of them named Hanako lived until age 226. I wonder what it would say if it could talk. Probably complain about its health.,Curious to dive deeper
1318," I didn't know that!  You should write a book, you have a way with words......a good way! Have you ever taken Creative Writing or do you write?",Surprised
1318," No, I just get creative to keep the conversation going. My mind is like the jellyfish: it is 98% water, and evaporates in the sun. At night time, I can use my brain for writing.",Curious to dive deeper
1318," You've got me laughing, I really appreciate a great sense of humor, it's refreshing!",Happy
1318,Did you know that the earth's magnetic field reverses itself every 200 to 300 millennia? I think we're about due. It'll probably screw up cell phone communication. Then what will the Millennials do?,Neutral
1318," The Millennials would definitely be lost without their cell phones! I actually didn't know that either, i'm feeling like I should have paid more attention in school at this point!",Surprised
1318," The earth is about 4 times denser than the sun. Sometimes I think people are getting denser, too.",Curious to dive deeper
1318,Thank you for the enlightening conversation!,Surprised
1319,Hello? How are you?,Neutral
1319," Good, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
1319," Great, Planets are very interesting! I didn't know Venus is the only planet that rotates clock-wise.",Surprised
1319,I like that Uranus rotates sideways and rolls.,Happy
1319," I do too! Wow,  life 455 light years away",Surprised
1319,Wonder if we will make contact. The UN appointed an official ambassador for extraterrestrials in 2010.,Surprised
1319," Yes, love that, very sad our forests have 80%been destroyed.",Surprised
1319," And sadly it has mostly been by us. If earth's whole history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would represent 1 minute and 17 seconds",Sad
1319," Interesting, that's no time at all. That black swallower fish must be strong!",Surprised
1319," Yeah, I will steer clear from it as it can eat prey ten times its weight.",Surprised
1319," lol, I love to watch seahorses, now I will be focusing on their necks.",Curious to dive deeper
1319," Yeah, they are pretty cool. But I would love to observe the immortal jellyfish too.",Surprised
1319," Unique to look at. My sister was stung by a jellyfish, very painful! ",Fearful
1319,I think it's cool that saltwater fish can drink through their mouths and also through osmosis.,Surprised
1319," Yes, I agree. If our days were still 5.5 hours long, I don't think I could everything done! ",Neutral
1319," Right, 24 hours is barely enough for me!",Surprised
1319,I like to snorkel in the ocean at coral reef and small fish. Its so beautiful!,Sad
1319," Yes, it is like another world here on Earth!",Happy
1319,The twilight zone is so cool!,Curious to dive deeper
1319," Ah, so the area at the edge of the sunlight's reach, 650 feet down?",Curious to dive deeper
1319," Yes,  home of the largest animal migration.",Neutral
1319,It would be cool if I could take a trip there. There may be more animals than there are stars in our galaxy.,Surprised
1320," every us president with a beard has been a republican, that's odd.",Happy
1320,That is odd. So what do you think of trump.,Happy
1320,I like trump,Happy
1320,Me too. I think he needs to calm down a little bit sometimes but he is a smart dude.,Happy
1320,yeah I never liked trump before he was president. I think he's doing a great job with all that he's been dealt.,Happy
1320,Trump is a republican. Did you know there hasnt been a president who wasnt a republican or democrat since 1853,Happy
1320,You think it's true that the last time a republican was elected president without a nixon or bush on the ticket was 1928? How can that be?,Curious to dive deeper
1320,It doesnt sound right to me either.,Happy
1320,funny about harry truman not wanting to be photo'd on the dumbo ride because he didn't want to be associated with repubs.,Surprised
1320,They was taking shots at each other even back then huh.,Happy
1320,yeah looks like it. Some things never change.,Curious to dive deeper
1320,consistent use of red and blue for the parties only started in 2000.,Happy
1320," yeah looking at the red blue map, looks like most blue is on the coasts and the red is in the middle.",Neutral
1320,Yeah. I wonder why that is.,Happy
1320,seems like the bigger cities are more blue.,Curious to dive deeper
1320,I guess that makes a little bit of sense.,Happy
1320,86% of nevada owned by the government?,Happy
1320," i believe it. Nevada is mostly desert, so who else would want it. ",Happy
1320,true! who would want it? guess it's good for nuclear testing. ;),Neutral
1320,Well if thats what they are doing out there Im guessing wikileaks will let us know.,Happy
1320," yeah, maybe wikileaks can let us know about space aliens in area 51 too. ",Surprised
1320,Well they published the governments plans to destroy wikileaks so Im sure they would have no problem leaking it. Lol.,Happy
1320," heard assange was offered an australian passport, I always thought he was european",Curious to dive deeper
1320,Yeah I did too. Well its been a good chat. I gotta get off here.,Happy
1321,Do you have a favorite album of all time?,Curious to dive deeper
1321," Good evening.  Yes, Michael Jackson's Thriller is one of my all time favorites.  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1321," Nice I loved Linkin Park's hybrid theory, I think it was the highest grossing album of the 21st century. MJ was probably highest in the 20th century?",Curious to dive deeper
1321,Probably.  Do you have any old vinyl record albums?,Curious to dive deeper
1321," I do not, I wish I did. I have a gold jimmy hendrix record but that is it. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1321," I have a big stack I inherited from my late father.  He was a true audiophile and had a good mix of classic rock, jazz, folk, you name it.  I love sitting and listening to them with all the clicks, pops, and white noise.  Looking at the album covers is pretty cool too, so of them are wild from the 60s!",Happy
1321," That is an awesome collection, I hope there is not Taylor Swift in there, that would ruin the collection! What are your best ones?",Curious to dive deeper
1321," The Beatles white album, sgt. peppers's lonely hearts Club, and Dark side of the moon.  No, Taylor Swifts in the bunch! lol",Happy
1321,dang I am so jealous! NWA in there at all?,Curious to dive deeper
1321," No, that's more my generation, though.  Straight outa Compton.",Happy
1321,I loved that album! They went platinum without much air time or major tours on that album,Curious to dive deeper
1321," Me too, classic in my mind!  You know, I was shocked to find out that Aerosmith made more money off of Guitar Hero than any of their albums.  Isn't that funny?",Surprised
1321," That is so funny, I definitely was a part of that. I love guitar hero! I should create my own album making songs from that game lol",Curious to dive deeper
1321,I liked it too!  How does Walmart make any money selling only clean versions of albums?,Curious to dive deeper
1321," Right, I would never spend money on albums that were clean, I would just download the album from youtube.",Curious to dive deeper
1321," Speaking of youtube, did you know it started out as a dating site?",Curious to dive deeper
1321," I did not know that, I think it would have been hard to find someone to date on that. Did you ever use it?",Curious to dive deeper
1321,Heck no!  I read somewhere that the first youtube video that was uploaded was of a man talking about an elephant.  I wonder how many views that got?,Surprised
1321," I don't know, I hope it is still up there, I will check it out. Good chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
1321,Great chatting with you as well.  Enjoy the rest of your evening.,Happy
1321," Thanks, you too!",Curious to dive deeper
1322," Hi there, do you follow politics much?",Curious to dive deeper
1322," I do, I feel that knowing what politicians stand for is very important to participating  in voting and things of that nature.",Neutral
1322," I agree, a must. Did you know that every president with a beard has been a republican?",Surprised
1322," I did not, did you know that there was a large ideological shift in the Republican party in the 1930s?",Surprised
1322,Did not know that. Funny thing about some presidents. Harry truman refused to be photographed in Disneyland on the dumbo.,Surprised
1322," That  is pretty interesting, I would much prefer something like that making headlines about a politician rather than some of the things we are facing now, such as the women's rights that representatives like Dave Brat were trying to make.",Curious to dive deeper
1322," Yeah, that is so true. Speaking of governments, did you know that wikileaks published the plans of the government to destroy it?",Surprised
1322," Wikileaks published it's own plans to destroy the government, or the government's plan to destroy itself? If it's the latter hopefully it's not because more women are taking seats in government.",Curious to dive deeper
1322,Wikileaks published plans that the government had made to destroy wikileaks.,Surprised
1322," Wow, that is quite a large scandal. Speaking of scandals, have you heard that Delegate Marshall argued for a law in which he called some cases of incest ""voluntary""?",Surprised
1322," What? No way. That is nonsense. Politics, really. ",Surprised
1322," Yes, he seemed to make a career out of restricting the rights of women, even criticizing the  long term use of contraception. ",Sad
1322," Things people believe, really. On a more fun side, are you a fan of music?",Curious to dive deeper
1322," I am, I like all different types of music and artists, from Taylor Swift to Korn, to some rap groups like RTJ.",Happy
1322,Taylor Swift has really made a name for herself and a lot of money. she owns an airport hangar in nashville.,Surprised
1322," She really has, she was even the youngest person to be signed by Sony/ATV. I think it's amazing she has an entire airport hangar!",Happy
1322," Yeah and on top of it, a $40 million private jet. I guees the needs the hangar to keep it there.",Surprised
1322," You can't really fault her for that. Plus she just seems like a really funny person, especially when she does things like walk backwards to not have her photo taken.",Happy
1322,Hahhaa true. Her album Fearless was the best selling on in 2009,Surprised
1322," Yea, I think it won four Grammy Awards. She really puts out great stuff.",Happy
1322,very true. It was nice chatting with you.,Happy
1323,Do you use youtube?,Neutral
1323," Yes I love youtube, do you?",Neutral
1323,It is definitely a go to for myself. There is a good reason why it is the 2nd largest search engine,Neutral
1323,Did you know the first youtube video was of a guy talking about an elephant?!,Surprised
1323," I didn't! Well youtube has come a long way, together with netflix accounting for 1/2 peak internet traffic here",Surprised
1323,Im watching Netflix right now!,Neutral
1323,Did you know justin bieber's baby is the most disliked video on youtube?,Neutral
1323,Thats hilarious! YouTube actually started as a dating site!,Surprised
1323," On the opposite side of the spectrum, police have their own blutube like youtube that share law enforcement videos",Neutral
1323,Thats hilarious. Are you a Taylor Swift fan?,Curious to dive deeper
1323," Not particularly, but I think she has made significant achievements in the field of music",Neutral
1323,She moved to Tennessee at 14 to pursue her country music career.,Neutral
1323,Hasn't she won like 4 grammies?,Neutral
1323,Yes and she was the youngest album of the year winner.,Neutral
1323,I didn't like how taylor swift made the infamous incident at the award shows though,Neutral
1323,Agreed and how she walks backwards to avoid people taking photos of her.,Neutral
1323,I think that is her right. Sometimes paparazzi are too extreme and in my opinion some deserve to get the same treatment.,Neutral
1323,Also agreed but thats the price for being super famous.,Curious to dive deeper
1323,I guess. I was surprised how the white noise accidentally released by her reached the canadian itunes charts. I guess under her brand anything is good,Neutral
1323," Yea, did you know aerosmith made more money from guitar hero than any album?",Surprised
1323,I'm not surprised. Guitar hero was a very VERY popular game,Neutral
1323," That game is very fun, but I never was good at it.",Neutral
1323," In any case, what matters was that you had fun, not your skill. I enjoyed our chat and I hope you have a wonderful day",Neutral
1324,Hi. I guess the state of Virginia has gone governmentally feminine.,Curious to dive deeper
1324,It looks like it.  If the men would just behave themselves like Scott Taylor didn't.,Neutral
1324," It's interesting that the Va state symbol seems to have a prophetic sign, since it was created in1776, when women would never even try to be in gov.",Surprised
1324," Yeah, I think everyone understands that ""Hell hath no fury...""  Elaine Luria doesn't seem like a woman to mess with as she was once a naval commander. ",Neutral
1324," Well, it will be interesting to see what these women can accomplish. Go, girls!",Curious to dive deeper
1324," Yeah, they can't do worse than Rep. David Albo who seems to think he needs a boombox to make a point.",Disgusted
1324," He lost, too and is seeking a new career. Ha. I believe the gov of Va, Elaine Luria is a republican. Maybe she will get in line to run for president in 2024.",Curious to dive deeper
1324,I would welcome that.  Did you know VA has a transvestite in Del. Danica Roem?  Amazing times!,Curious to dive deeper
1324," Really? PA has one in gov, too. I'm not sure but maybe attorney general. ",Curious to dive deeper
1324," It's funny, Hillary Clinton was the president of Young Republicans in college.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1324," I think she is connected to PA, also. How one changes to advance oneself. ;)  Now with Trump in the driver's seat, there are more conservative justices.",Curious to dive deeper
1324," Yeah, my bet is Hillary cleaned out their finds and then went democrat. Also funny is that the GOP's Nixon is the only president  to propose a guaranteed minimum income.  Pretty socialist for a republican.",Curious to dive deeper
1324," Good point. Did you know that, not counting Trump, the last Republican elected president, without a Nixon or Bush involved was 1928. Trump broke the pattern.",Curious to dive deeper
1324,Rampant nepotism... Monaco ditched income taxes because the casinos were sufficient.  We need more casinos!,Surprised
1324," Wow. That would be great to eliminate income tax, but our gov. is too greedy. They would benefit from both.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1324,That's for sure.  Too bad we all didn't grow up wealthy like Taylor Swift.  She grew up on an 11-acre tree farm.,Surprised
1324," Yes, and only 14 years old when she moved to Tennessee and signed a music contract soon after.",Curious to dive deeper
1324,I can't believe she walks backwards to avoid photos. I hope she does not trip and fall to avoid photos.,Surprised
1324," Ha. She also kept her music off spotify, so people couldn't listen without paying for it.",Curious to dive deeper
1324,Seems greedy but she did donate the proceeds from Wildest Dream to African Wildlife conservation so I don't know what to think of her.,Surprised
1324," Well, she flies around in a private jet and houses it at Nashville International. I'd like to see her use her contributions for human rights in the US.",Curious to dive deeper
1324," Yeah, must be nice.  Well you've been a great chat partner.  Thank you.",Surprised
1325,Do you like Taylor Swift?,Curious to dive deeper
1325,Listen to some of her stuff.  Think her most recent single is Delicate?,Curious to dive deeper
1325,I'll have to check it out. She won female artist of the year at iHeart radio music awards.,Curious to dive deeper
1325,Heard about that.  There was some to-do about her not being there to accept the award.  She's apparently been out of public view for a while and people are making speculations about why.  Guess it's hard to be a superstar.,Neutral
1325,I can't even imagine. Do you use youtube at all?,Curious to dive deeper
1325," Funny you should mention YouTube.  That Delicate music video utilizes it a lot.  Guess her fan base the ""swifties"" are on social media a lot.  Got any favorite youtube videos?",Curious to dive deeper
1325,Really honestly i don't use it for that. I usally use it when i need to learn something...about my car or fix my computer or phone. Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
1325," Mostly music.  My little one, for some odd reason, really likes that Gangnam Style video. ",Neutral
1325,Oh ok You know youtube is the second largest search engine on the internet?,Curious to dive deeper
1325,I can imagine.  Heard this crazy stat that there's more than 400 hours of content uploaded to YouTube each minute.  That's a lot of things to look up!  But I think it's kinda cool that I can look up full albums of songs I used to listed to on vinyl.,Neutral
1325,I was not aware that google purchased them for 1.65 billion dollars.,Curious to dive deeper
1325,Wow didn't realize Google owned it.  Do you just watch the free stuff?  Heard there's a YouTube Premium service.,Curious to dive deeper
1325,Yeah i got Hulu and Netflix i don't need to pay for anything else but i heard that as well.,Curious to dive deeper
1325,Considering getting the premium service since it's ad-free.  Think Hulu has some of their stuff on YouTube as well.  Not sure about Netflix.,Neutral
1325,Well i might try the free 30 day trial they are the 2nd largest search engine on the web. Did you hear about Blutube?,Curious to dive deeper
1325,Think so.  Some to do with the police right?,Curious to dive deeper
1325,Yeah apparently they share cop enforcement videos.,Curious to dive deeper
1325," That must get a lot of likes.  Oh, I bet you don't know what video was the most disliked video on YouTube.",Curious to dive deeper
1325,What is it?,Curious to dive deeper
1325," Funny!  Justin Bieber's ""Baby.""",Neutral
1325,Oh ok that makes sense then. Did you know that NWA's Straight Outta Compton album went platinum without the support of airplay or a major tour. That's deep and they were they first to do that. Nice chatting with you my friend.,Curious to dive deeper
1325,That was a pretty good album.  I'm more of a Dark Side of the Moon kind of listener.  Take care.,Neutral
1326,Hello there and good day. Have you heard about the Virginia women who are staging a political takeover?,Curious to dive deeper
1326,I read something about it.  Its seems that Democratic women candidates are making inroads.,Curious to dive deeper
1326,Yet seems that way. A lot of powerful women to like Elaine Luria who is a retired naval commander.,Curious to dive deeper
1326,What is unexpected in that a Democrat unseated a Republican in Hampton Roads.  Virginia use to be a divided state politically with the Democrats ruling urban Northern Virginia and Republicans dominating the southern more rural areas of the state.  That seems to be changing as well.,Curious to dive deeper
1326,Oh wow that is very interesting yes like you say it is definitely changing. I bet you the Republican Party is scared or as some people call it... the Grand Old Party.,Curious to dive deeper
1326," I am not sure what to make of it.  Politics has gotten so polarizing with the Democrats being pulled very hard left.  But considering Hillary Clinton was president of the Young Republicans in college, anything is possible.",Curious to dive deeper
1326,Yeah that's a good point it is becoming so divided right now. The last time there was a president who wasn't a Republican or Democrat was back in 1853.,Surprised
1326," I am personally registered as an independent although you might say I lean Republican.  The party system has gotten out of hand.  Too get things passed, you have to support your party first and your constituents second.   I think government should be a function of the people (voters) and not the parties.",Curious to dive deeper
1326,Wow that is very well put. Yeah I think there has to definitely be a balance between the principle of individual freedom and the idea of absolute state authority.,Neutral
1326," I am all for individual freedoms and the right to ""pursue happiness"".  The government should not be in the business of choosing winners and losers, like it did in 2008 when it bailed out big banks like J.P. Morgan.  Ironically, it was J.P. Morgan that bailed out the U.S. government in 1895.",Curious to dive deeper
1326,Yeah I definitely agree with you. The US government does have a lot of power in Nevada they own 86% of the land there.,Surprised
1326," I bet it has something to do with Area 51!  What are your thoughts of celebrities and government?  In the midterms, Taylor Swift decided to finally get involved in politics and put herself out as being against Republican candidate Marsha Blackburn.  It backfired on her!!!!",Curious to dive deeper
1326,Yeah I think celebrities have a voice but they should only use it to do good things. Taylor Swift has done a lot of controversial things like removing her music from Spotify.,Surprised
1326," I think too many celebrities (like the Kardashians) do not have any ideal what life is like in real America.  And others do their best to distance themselves into the elite.  Social media (right or wrong) gives them an instant and oversized voice.  And they often speak of things they are unknowledgeable about.  They would be better off sticking to what they are good at.  Taylor is an amazing artist, but she is not an average American living paycheck to paycheck!",Curious to dive deeper
1326,Yeah I think they are living in their own little world. Kanye West is another example and he actually did a Saturday night live skit mocking himself for interrupting an award ceremony!,Surprised
1326,I like the way T.S. donated the proceeds of Wildest Dreams song to wildlife conservation and I hope she does more of that.  But wading into politics sullies her image.  What are your thoughts on the income tax?  I like the way Monaco has eliminated the income tax in 1869 because of sufficient revenue from other sources such as gaming.,Curious to dive deeper
1326,Yeah Monaco seems like a really cool town for doing that. Did you know that Taylor Swift owns her own jet. It cost around $40 million.,Curious to dive deeper
1326," I did not know that, but I am not surprised.  After all, she was the youngest artist to sign on with Sony/ATV Music.  It must be nice to grow up in a wealthy family who moved from Pennsylvania to Nashville TN when Taylor was 14 so she could pursue her music career. ",Disgusted
1326,Yeah she had a lot of resources to help her out. And it all paid off. She was the youngest album of the year Grammy winner ever.,Surprised
1326," She has had a lot of success and I do not begrudge her for that. At one point in time, she seemed ""somewhat normal"".  Now, she is a all-out celebrity; she even walks backwards to avoid having her photo taken!",Curious to dive deeper
1326,Wow that seems very extreme. She has definitely done well for herself. But it was nice talking with you goodbye.,Happy
1327," Hi, how are you?",Happy
1327," Good, do you like Taylor Swift? what do you think about the prize she won recently.",Curious to dive deeper
1327,I am indifferent to her. My daughter likes her though. Do you like her?,Happy
1327," I think she is a good artist, not  my favorite but she has good skills.",Happy
1327,That makes sense. What is your favorite artist or band?,Curious to dive deeper
1327," I like Led Zeppelin a lot, its one of my favorite bands, what about yours?",Curious to dive deeper
1327,I like Jimmy Buffett a lot but I think that has more to do with the party involved than the music. I also like Pink Floyd and some new stuff. MOstly alt rock.,Happy
1327," I see, what about Aerosmith? theres a cool fact about the band want to know what it is?",Curious to dive deeper
1327,Oh course I do! Hit me!,Curious to dive deeper
1327,Ok so Aerosmith made more money from the game Guitar Hero than any of their albums.,Happy
1327,Really???? That seems like... they got jipped on their album sales!,Surprised
1327," Could be, I bet they got really bad deals.",Neutral
1327,Yeah. I heard that Napoleon Dynamite only made like $5000 on that movie. He got screwed!,Curious to dive deeper
1327,He sure did! only $5000!! I bet he could sue someone for that!,Surprised
1327,Did you know Kanye predicted his taylor swift interruption?,Curious to dive deeper
1327," He did? I bet there was something else going there, you know Taylor Swift comes from a wealthy family.",Curious to dive deeper
1327,I actually did not... How did they get their money?,Curious to dive deeper
1327,I dont know how but apparently they lived on a 11 acre tree farm.,Curious to dive deeper
1327,Wow. Now I feel like I have to look into it...,Curious to dive deeper
1327,Another interesting fact is that Swift walks backward to avoid photos.,Curious to dive deeper
1327,How weird???,Happy
1328," Have you seen the ""Handmaid's Tale: The Musical""?  It has the actress that played Rory on the Gilmore Girls.",Curious to dive deeper
1328," No, but I've heard of it. I like comedy. ",Curious to dive deeper
1328,I guess it has many interactions that follow the news cycle.  That's one way to remain contemporary.,Surprised
1328,Oh. ok. I like comedy. I know Comedy Central has cancelled over 200 shows since 1989. That's a lot of laughs lost.,Happy
1328,They must be a bit picky.  I would like the see the Handmaiden's Tale at the Kennedy Center.  BTW: I like comedies too...,Happy
1328,I would say. I'll have to check out that movie.,Happy
1328,I love/loved Monty Python.  Funny that the name was borrowed for a computer language.,Surprised
1328,I would not have guessed that.,Curious to dive deeper
1328," Did you know Linkin Park's ""Hybrid Theory"" is the best selling album of the 21st century? ",Curious to dive deeper
1328," No, but I love albums. I know the Dark Side of the Moon was still a best seller in 2014 despite being over 40 years old at the time.",Curious to dive deeper
1328,It's a classic... It's funny that two 100-year-old twins from Japan released a rap album.  It's never too late!,Surprised
1328,No way! Amazing how free music is. Too bad most  of the 21st century's focus has been on cd's and MP3 formats.,Surprised
1328," I guess technically, ""album"" just means a collection, like a ""photo album.""  Are you into the Spider-man movies?",Curious to dive deeper
1328,I am not sure if I have seen any but I like Spidey. I know in the 90's Joe Perry from Aeorsmith performed the opening.,Curious to dive deeper
1328,I used to listen to Aerosmith.  I can't believe the military is trying to get soldiers to have Spider-man capabilities.,Surprised
1328," No kidding? I know the late Stan Lee was supposed to get 10% of net profits made on his characters, but producers of the first Spiderman movie claimed it made nothing despite making 800m and paid him nothing. ",Angry
1328,That's not cool.  He made several appearances on The Big Bang Theory.  I didn't know he died.  Sad.,Sad
1328," Yes, recently. Very sad. A talent lost. Did you know Marvel hosted a public wedding in 1987 when Spiderman married Mary Jane?",Surprised
1328,No.  Great wedding I'm sure... DId you know that the Green Lantern film was originally going to be a comedy with Jack Black.  Couldn't have hurt...,Curious to dive deeper
1328,I heard that. It would have been great!,Happy
1328,Thanks for your help.  You were excellent!,Happy
1329,Hello?,Happy
1329,hey hows it going?,Happy
1329,Well well. And you? How do you feel about soccer in the field?,Curious to dive deeper
1329," I don't' know much about soccer personally, what about you? I do see that drew carey served in the marine corp which I didn't know",Happy
1329," Oh, well, I do see it. But you can talk to me a little more about what you drew, I'm curious",Curious to dive deeper
1329," well I was talking about drew carey who is a tv star, have you seen him on tv?",Happy
1329," Or if, if I have seen, go that if it is talented, besides everything is singer and comedian",Surprised
1329," well have you seen evan almighty? that movie is the most expensive comedy ever made, you might like that it is a comedy after all",Happy
1329," I can not imagine, this evan is a great actor, but I also love the pratagoniza the other powerful, this is much better personally",Surprised
1329,Do you listen to led zeppelin at all? I guess it says they decided not to title their fourth album to confuse the press which I think is funny,Happy
1329," Yes, yes, it was very fun, I admit it",Happy
1329," thats good, and it says walmart only sells clean versions of albums, that explains why I never buy music at walmart, only food and random clothes for me",Happy
1329," I understand, that's something interesting",Curious to dive deeper
1329,have you seen any of the spiderman movies?  do you know his origin?,Curious to dive deeper
1329," I've seen them all, absolutely everyone and I do not know their origin",Happy
1329," ah, well he gets bitten by a radioactive spider, this says a real person used mercury to try to convert his bones to metal after seeing xmen and had multiple spider bites from watching spiderman, just silly!",Happy
1329," Well, I think that everything is science fiction, although I do not remove the doubt from my head and that is that there may be someone wanting to achieve this.",Curious to dive deeper
1329," well that would be true, I hope that these people don't do anything stupid though, this guy could have gotten seriously hurt",Happy
1329," Or something much worse, I think it would be better to leave everything as this",Neutral
1329," do you like james cameron? I guess he was going to make a spiderman movie with arnold but it was cancelled, that would have been awesome",Happy
1329," I can imagine, it would have been something wonderful",Happy
1330," Hi, how are you doing tonight?",Neutral
1330,I'm good. Do you follow any sports at all?,Curious to dive deeper
1330,I sometimes follow sports. I enjoyed watching basketball and soccer. What about you?,Neutral
1330," I watch an occasional NFL game, but I don't pay attention consistently. How do you feel about how influential athletes are?",Curious to dive deeper
1330," Well, they get a lot of coverage, so the advertisers pay for time during the game and to associate their product with them. If there were no commercial interest they would get no money. ",Neutral
1330," True, but it makes me miss the days when Michael Jordan was at the top of his game",Neutral
1330," I don't mind LeBron, but I do miss MJ. He really revitalized the game. ",Neutral
1330," Without him, Air Jordans wouldn't have been created or succeed. The NBA banned the shoes at first, but Nike was willing to pay the fine since MJ would wear them. Now they're everywhere",Neutral
1330,The fine just brought more attention to Jordan and the shoes. Cheap marketing for Nike.,Neutral
1330,It was definitely worth the risk for them in the end. They've made back that money easily,Neutral
1330,The whole sport is about shoes. Anything to get people to buy shoes. Is tennis the same way?,Curious to dive deeper
1330,I think tennis is more about the shirts. I'm not sure who decided to call them polo shirts since they were created for tennis players first,Curious to dive deeper
1330," I guess. I don't know the sport. Shirts, rackets, headbands, helicopters? They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 us open",Neutral
1330,Maybe not enough people watch it for it to be over-commercialized. I wonder if television was around for the longest tennis match. Eleven hours over three days is a lot of watching,Curious to dive deeper
1330," I don't think they could televise the whole thing. There were other shows, the news, other advertisers. Wouldn't work. But they could tape it.",Neutral
1330," Good point. A black man has only won the US Open title once. Black women, however, is a different story with the Williams sisters",Neutral
1330,How many times have they won? And how much money do they have? Tennis really pays well if you're at the top.,Neutral
1330,They must have sponsorships. I see them in commercials. The sport is closely related to croquet,Neutral
1330," Hm. That's funny. I never made the connection. Anyway, nice chatting with you!",Happy
1330,It makes sense! You too!,Neutral
1330,Have a good night!,Happy
1330,And don't fall for all the over-commercialized products. Unless they're good products,Neutral
1331," I've always been a fan of the NBA and basketball, but I never knew that shooting ""granny style"" is the best technique to score free throws. NBA players refuse to do it because it looks stupid haha.",Surprised
1331," I suppose NBA players, maybe all athletes in general, care a lot about how they're perceived by the general public. ",Curious to dive deeper
1331," Of course. And I'm sure a man doesn't want to shoot ""granny style."" There's a lot I would do for $32 million. That's what Iverson's getting when he's 55.",Curious to dive deeper
1331," There are a lot of NFL players that have recently been very public about their views on certain political standpoints. President trump, racism, etc. have all been hot topics. This seems to create a lot of buzz around their names and throws them right into the spotlight. I bet they enjoy it!",Neutral
1331," Yeah I agree. And everyone has an opinion they're just dying to express.  I feel like this happens more in football than in other sports, like baseball and tennis. ",Disgusted
1331,Yeah they seem to be thinking more about the game itself rather than the politics surrounding it.,Neutral
1331,That's they way it should be. I love tennis. The longest match in tennis history was 11 hours over 3 days. I wonder if that was televised.,Surprised
1331," That's incredible! I wonder how they sustained that much energy for such a long stretch of time. For a long time, until 1978 to be exact, tennis players were allowed to use any item as their racket. Can you imagine?! I wonder what some of the strangest items used as ""rackets"" were.... Boards? Dead salmon? Haha!",Curious to dive deeper
1331," What! I never knew that. What exactly does ""any item"" entail? How about a baseball bat? They also used a helicopter to dry the grass courts in the '69 US Open.",Surprised
1331," Literally any item that could hit a ball over the net, I suppose. A bat would've been hilarious to see! Imagine a tennis ball flying over the net at 50mph. The helicopter trick sounds brilliant! That's a lot of fuel to burn through, though. ",Surprised
1331,The would have been wild. They should reinstate that rule. I'd like do see someone come in with a loaf of hero bread. That would be entertaining to watch. Everyone has gotten so serious and is always offended these days. We always looked to sports as a form of entertainment but now it's so political.,Sad
1331," I agree. It's nice to have your voice heard, but why should they be heard louder than the average person? Oh well... On a brighter note, did you know that George Clooney had a pet potbellied pig?! His name was Max. Apparently George treated him like a dog. He let him sleep in the bed with him and everything. I wonder if the pig was smelly... ",Happy
1331," If I had a pig, I'd probably treat it like a dog too. They are very smart and very clean animals, despite popular though. George Clooney is actually a distant relative of Lincoln too.",Happy
1331," Wow, I always thought they were gross! You must be right though, there are a lot of people getting pigs as pets these days. I had no idea he was a relative of Lincoln! How would you even find out if you were related to someone historical like that? I want to find out!",Curious to dive deeper
1331," Probably follow family your history. I've always wanted to do that myself, but even if I found out I was distantly related to someone like Einstein, what does it really matter? It really wouldn't change my life or make me feel better or worse about myself.",Surprised
1331," It would just be something awesome to throw into a conversation I guess. Other than that, pretty useless information- especially considering how fast lineage spreads.  ",Neutral
1331,That is true. I have always liked George Clooney. He also helped fund a satellite that documents war atrocities in Africa.,Happy
1331," Wow! He sure has a lot of money, but he seems to spend it well. He even gave 14 of his close friends each $1 million as a gift. That's pretty admirable! ",Surprised
1331,Extremely admirable! I need a friend like that! He's the only person ever to be nominated for the Academy Awards in 6 categories. Pretty impressive.,Surprised
1331," I do too! Haha! He's a very accomplished guy. He even had a small part in South Park. He was cast as the ""voice"" for Stan's dog. He was only asked to make dog sounds!",Happy
1331,Get out! That's interesting! Well I have to run! Have a great day!,Surprised
1332,Do you watch the NBA?,Curious to dive deeper
1332,I sure do. DO you like Reggie MIller?,Curious to dive deeper
1332," I loved Reggie Miller growing up. I still remember his famous game against the Knicks, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1332," Yeah he is great but as good as he is, his sister was always better than him",Curious to dive deeper
1332," I knew she was good, how much better?",Curious to dive deeper
1332,SO good that she once broke 8 national records by scoring 105 points in a game,Curious to dive deeper
1332," wow that is crazy! I knew he was good, but she was amazing! That is better than Wilt Chamberlain! Do you have a favorite team?",Curious to dive deeper
1332," I do not actually, just enjoy the games. Did you hear of that deal Iverson signed with Rebook in 2001?",Curious to dive deeper
1332," I didn't hear about the deal, but I know I used to love those shoes. I had so many pairs!",Curious to dive deeper
1332,Nice. He is making $800 000 a year till he is 55 and then gets $32 million,Curious to dive deeper
1332," wow, I heard he was caught begging for cheeseburgers from fans a year ago. He must be hoping 55 comes fast because that is a lot of money",Curious to dive deeper
1332,Yeah I bet he is. Do you know what is the granny style shot?,Curious to dive deeper
1332," I love the granny shot, but never would bust it out when it mattered lol. Are you a granny shotter?",Curious to dive deeper
1332,I like it and it is the best one to score but players think it looks stupid and do no use it,Curious to dive deeper
1332,I think the players who struggle with free throws should use it. They can't shoot any worse than they already do,Curious to dive deeper
1332,I guess so. Did you ever buy Air Jordans?,Curious to dive deeper
1332," I love Air Jordans, but I buy them at discount because they are too expensive lol. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1332,I agree. When Jordan wore them in court when they came out he was fined for it,Curious to dive deeper
1332," I heard that! Didn't nike pay the fines for him, free advertisement basically, well not too free lol! It was so nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
1332,Yes they did. Same here have a great one.,Curious to dive deeper
1332," Thanks you too, enjoy your night!",Curious to dive deeper
1333," Hey not sure how much you read so far, but it's crazy the FDA in the US has burnt six tons of books in an act to censor!",Surprised
1333,Thats interesting.  I do a lot of audible nowadays.  Theres a woman who reads 4700 words per minute!,Curious to dive deeper
1333," Yeah it's so nice being able to have someone read out 1000s of books instead of just having one on hand. Holy cow! I really should read more, not really something we consider a complex intensive task since we do it so much. Need that cognitive boost though forsure as I'm aging.",Curious to dive deeper
1333,I hear edgar allen poe wrote the oldest known cyborg!,Curious to dive deeper
1333,Oldest raven too! It's funny that there was a moral dilemma in the 18th century due to people reading novels. Harry Potter would be so taboo,Curious to dive deeper
1333," Haha those books are great!  Love Harry Potter,  have you seen or red any othe the new wizarding world stuff? Like Fantastic Beasts?",Curious to dive deeper
1333," I haven't, are they worth checking out? ",Curious to dive deeper
1333," Absolutely!  It takes place all before Harry Potter,  its so cool to see all the history that was always mentioned in Harry Potter.  They have only release 2 movies so far,  they are predicted to be 5 movies. ",Curious to dive deeper
1333,Wow I actually had no idea about the premise that's awesome! Any allusions to HP narrative so far? I wonder where Harry ranks on that wiki for fictional character power/abilities ranking list hahaha.,Happy
1333," I dont think he will be in any of the movies,  it was way before his time.  Thats awesome,  I wonder how long the list is lol",Curious to dive deeper
1333,Shows some crack in the wall in the shape of his scar lolol :) but thanks for the recommendation I don't know why I was ignorant to the idea of watching them. Weird that literature was an Olympic event!,Surprised
1333," That does seem weird,  I thought the olympics was a physical event.  Thats cool though! ",Curious to dive deeper
1333,Yeah just imagine being some ripped dude ready to do that disc toss event right next to some guy dressed like Shakespeare ready to make some out of control poems!,Happy
1333,hahahah or maybe its a literature throwing contest!  Thats physical lol,Curious to dive deeper
1333,hahaha there we go! I wonder who pulled the plug on the arts being removed out of the olympics. It'd be cool to see rap battles there nowadays though hahah,Happy
1333," yeah that would be cool.  I hear the koreans have a new kind of rap battle, compliment battle lol",Curious to dive deeper
1333,hahaha that actually sounds like it'd be much more difficult I dig it!,Happy
1333,Yeah a more positive outlook instead of putting people down and making fun of them lol,Curious to dive deeper
1333,Yeah seriously and very few momentswhere we think critically in a complimentary manner compared to how much we road rage or think negatively of strangers hahaha. This was nice though going to check out,Happy
1333," I need to check it out too,  I have never seen it, only heard about it",Curious to dive deeper
1333," Sorry about that hahaha lost the chat window there for some reason, but going to check out Fantastic Beasts now hope you have a good night, bye!",Happy
1333," great chat,  have a good night. ",Neutral
1334,Are you a fan of any sports?,Curious to dive deeper
1334," I like all sports. When I get bored, I usually watch sports. It's what I do. What about you? Do you like sports?",Happy
1334,I love watching the NBA. There are some very good athletes that play,Neutral
1334,I agree. I really like LeBron James. Do you like him?,Happy
1334," I do. He is probably the best player right now. Not quite as good as Michael Jordan, but still can put on a show",Curious to dive deeper
1334,Yeah. I feel bad for the bad rap he has gotten. He seems to be doing the right things and he is still getting bagged for it.,Sad
1334,Oh yeah. He has handled the pressure very well though. Being tooted as the chosen one since high school cant be easy.,Surprised
1334,I agree! And he has not gotten into any trouble off the court. It's a shame he receive this hatred.,Sad
1334,It is just like Allen Iverson. He brought a very new style to the NBA at the time. Did you know hes still getting paid by Reebok?,Surprised
1334,He signed a lifetime deal worth $32M. Almost as much as Jordan makes on shoes!,Happy
1334,Its crazy some of the contracts now though. Lebron has a lifetime contract with Nike. Suppose to be like a billion dollars,Surprised
1334,Yeah! I think he will be the first athlete to make over a billion with income. That was a goal when he was still in HS.,Surprised
1334,Its crazy how it all started with Mj's shoes. He was the first player to have his own shoe. And they were banned at first,Surprised
1334," That's the fruit from the forbidden tree! I know sneaker heads that spend thousands annually on shoes, Jordans in particular",Surprised
1334,I use to be one of those sneaker heads.,Neutral
1334,REALLY! That's nuts! What's your best pair? Do you still have them?,Curious to dive deeper
1334,There was a year of the rabbit jordans that came out in 2011. But there were so many. I have given up most of my collection,Neutral
1334,I find sneakerheads interesting. My one friend has over 10K in jordans...,Curious to dive deeper
1334,Its an addictive hobby. Too bad most of us dont have the lifetime contracts as well,Neutral
1334," If you did, you could get those Js. I think $32M would buy a lot of shoes!",Happy
1334,Yes it would. Tim duncan gave up money to stay in college 4 years,Surprised
1334,That was a bold move by him but he's a different cat. Nice chatting with you.,Happy
1335,Do you subscribe to HBO?,Neutral
1335,No I don't but I have a friend's password to netflix,Neutral
1335,I have Amazon Prime. You can see most shows by streaming now instead of having cable.,Neutral
1335,Yes I have amazon prime and hulu myself.  Both are pretty cheap and my hulu comes with my phone plan on sprint.,Neutral
1335,I did have a free trial of hulu but didn't use it enough.,Neutral
1335,Yes I know I should not share passwords but I rarely watch netflix so I do not see the big harm,Neutral
1335,I don't share my passwords because no one wants what I have.,Neutral
1335,laugh!  Definitely lots of people use netflix though - in the evening it accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in this country,Surprised
1335," Yes, I hear people talk about it all the time and I don't think I have even watched Netflix.",Neutral
1335,Yes but did you know they still mail out dvds?  They spent more on postage than bandwidth!,Surprised
1335,I didn't know that. I do remember getting a dvd years ago.,Sad
1335,Yes.  Netflix was even started because the founder had to pay a late fee on a rental,Neutral
1335,I remember how Netflix was putting Blockbusters out of business.,Neutral
1335,Yes Blockbuster should have bought netflix when it was offered to them for 50 million,Neutral
1335," Yes, It is funny to drive by places that use to be Blockbusters and to think that is how many of us spent Friday and Saturday night.",Sad
1335,Yes and now with netflix and youtube they make up half of all internet traffic,Neutral
1335," Yes, It does.",Neutral
1335,Of course amazon is a huge company - I love prime video but I love the free shipping as well.,Neutral
1335," Yes, Amazon Prime is my favorite of all of them. It gives you so much for the subscription fee.",Neutral
1335," Yes and it is making Bezos rich  - he built a clock into the side of a mountain that should run for 10,000 years!",Curious to dive deeper
1335,At least he will know what time it is.,Neutral
1335,Yeah - I just wish I was the first customer - I could have had a building named after me!,Neutral
1335," Funny, true. It was nice chatting with.",Neutral
1335,Bye,Neutral
1336,Do you watch netflix much?,Curious to dive deeper
1336,Yeah I love Netflix. You? I am so glad they expanded the business to streaming media in 2007 because that is all I use now.,Happy
1336," For sure, I just left cable and depending on that. I love watching it at night after 9pm, Netflix accoutns for 33 percent of bandwidth during that time",Curious to dive deeper
1336,Congrats on leaving cable LOL. Yes and along with YouTube they make up half of pick Internet traffic in North America.,Curious to dive deeper
1336," dang, that is crazy lol! Did you ever hear how netflix started?",Curious to dive deeper
1336,No I'm not sure how? I do know that they released 126 original series and films in 2016 more than any other network or cable channel.,Curious to dive deeper
1336," They guy was sick of paying blockbuster fees and started this instead. Then blockbuster had the chance to buy netflix and they didn't, and we know what happend there!",Curious to dive deeper
1336,Oh man I bet he is haunted by that every day LOL. Well one of my favorite Netflix series is the stranger things I love how it is set in the 1980s. Have you seen it?,Happy
1336," lol for sure! I loved stranger things, that was so thrilling I watched both seasons in like one week. Are you a fan?",Curious to dive deeper
1336,Awesome. Yes me too can't wait for the next season. Counting down the days LOL. I wish the second season lasted more than nine episodes.,Happy
1336," yea that kind of stunk, but it was good and so suspenseful! The stranger things font is the same on used on the dungeons and dragons player handbook from the late 80s",Curious to dive deeper
1336,Oh that's really cool. The actress who portrays 11's mother on Stranger Things has lived her whole life without legs. Very cool that she was able to be on the show.,Surprised
1336," Wow, that is very inspiring to hear that. I liked David Harbour as hopper, he was really good",Curious to dive deeper
1336,Yeah he was my favorite character. Apparently he tore his Achilles while playing the character a Achilles in a Shakespeare production. How ironic.,Surprised
1336," wow lol, that is very ironic. Did you ever watch Lilyhammer on Netflix?",Curious to dive deeper
1336,No I never did. What is Lilyhammer?,Curious to dive deeper
1336," It is an old mafia guy who moves to lilyhammer to start a new life. I watched 2 seasons, it was netflix's first original they made.",Curious to dive deeper
1336," Oh awesome. In their effort to create and produce new content, secure the rights for additional content, and diversify through many countries, they have racked up billions in debt.",Curious to dive deeper
1336," Yea, hopefully it works out in the end. They are worth like 2 billion right now! It was so nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
1336,That is incredible and I believe it. But they have 21.9 billion dollars in debt lol. Hard to believe! But it was great chatting with you too! Have a good day partner.,Surprised
1336," wow that is so much debt, they should erase it soon hopefully! Have a good day also!",Curious to dive deeper
1337,do you like rap music?,Curious to dive deeper
1337," I like some of it mostly the older stuff, and you?",Curious to dive deeper
1337," Me too actually, do you know Tupac and his music?",Curious to dive deeper
1337," Yes of course, his music is even in the library of congress now",Curious to dive deeper
1337," Yes for cultural significance, I can totally see why though",Curious to dive deeper
1337,Yeah me too. Do you like Eminem?,Curious to dive deeper
1337,I like him too. Did you know he wanted to become a comic book artist?,Curious to dive deeper
1337," Yes he really liked the spiderman charater, maybe that is why",Curious to dive deeper
1337,Yeah. Do you know what compliment battle is?,Curious to dive deeper
1337,Yes that is a kind of rap they practice in south korea,Curious to dive deeper
1337," Yes. A judge once gave the ruling in the form of rap, do you know why?",Curious to dive deeper
1337,Yes because the suit was against Eminem Crazy. DO you like horses?,Curious to dive deeper
1337,I love horses.In Iceland they have a fifth speed,Curious to dive deeper
1337,Yeah it is called the tolt and is like speedwalking for horses,Curious to dive deeper
1337,So cool. DO you know why dalmatians are associated with firefighters?,Curious to dive deeper
1337,THat is because they can calm down horses and protect them if it need be,Curious to dive deeper
1337,Yeah. Clint Eastwood has played so many movies with horses and he is somewhat allergic to them.,Curious to dive deeper
1337,Nice. Once two high school kids rode their horses to school and got suspended because it was no vehicles to school day,Curious to dive deeper
1337,Wow crazy. Have you heard of lipizanner horseS?,Curious to dive deeper
1337," I have, they are born a dark color and change to white as they grow. Do you like colorful clothing?",Curious to dive deeper
1337," I love it, same as the pilgrims do",Curious to dive deeper
1338," Hi, how are you? Are you interested in horses?",Neutral
1338,I used to learn how to ride them. Interesting experience to say the least,Neutral
1338," I've never ridden a horse, well, except like a pony at a fair. No galloping. ",Neutral
1338," Honestly, I am still surprised that horses are strong enough to carry the weight of humans and traverse for days. Can you imagine another human being able to do the same?",Neutral
1338," No, not at all. It's funny that two high school students rode their horses to school on 'no vehicles to school day', and got suspended. Well, that's not a vehicle, is it? Is there a school rule against horses? I wonder what state that was.",Neutral
1338," I think those are all fair points. The school should have no grounds to suspend them, unless someone got injured.",Neutral
1338," They could have just sent the kids home. I was surprised that Clint Eastwood, who has been on horseback in many of his movies, had a mid-life allergy to horses. I wonder how he developed that.",Neutral
1338," Well allergies are quite bizarre. My friend's father a huge lover of fish and I can't stress this enough. However, in his late 50s he developed a severe allergy to fish and had to stop eating them",Neutral
1338," I guess the immune system changes for some reason. That's odd. The body has been fine with it for so long. I guess change and development are normal. Lipizzaner horses, known for their classical dressage performances, are born black or brown and take about 6 years to turn completely white",Neutral
1338," It is a shame too since horses share quite a rare history with people as well are very unique animals. I wonder why once icelandic horses leave iceland, they can never return",Neutral
1338," I'd never heard that. Maybe once they get out, they can't stand being there. Too small, too cold.",Neutral
1338,Surprisingly almost all modern thoroughbred racehorse are descendants of a horse named darley arabian,Neutral
1338," Really? I didn't know that. Dalmatians are associated with firefighters because they would calm and protect the horses. I thought any dog could do that, but I guess Dalmatians are suited for it.",Neutral
1338,Wow that is impressive. I wonder if the dalmatians working for firefighters wore their own versions of fireproof clothing,Curious to dive deeper
1338,I don't know. They must be smart enough to steer clear of the danger. Maybe they stayed with the horses at the fire.,Neutral
1338,I wonder when people started putting clothing on animals though. Clothing serves many purposes from protection to appeal,Neutral
1338," I guess they want to make their pet look like a little person. Cute and stuff. I understand that animals can get cold, so clothing could help. Still, people can go overboard.",Neutral
1338,Well clothing has a very interesting history. Did you know people used to do laundry in old faithful the geyser?,Neutral
1338," I wouldn't want to get to close to that thing. It's on top of a super volcano, I believe. Plus the water is awfully hot.",Neutral
1338," Well when it erupted, it erupted clean cloths lol",Neutral
1338,The clothes would be beautiful for people no longer there. Can you believe that Apple had a clothing line in 1986?,Neutral
1338,I hope they didn't try to get the high margins they have for their phones on their clothing.,Neutral
1338,They certainly wouldn't have. Clothing is really a tight market. Little margin there.,Neutral
1338," But if you have a brand and limited quantity, you could increase margins. In any case, thanks for chatting.",Neutral
1339,Hi Do you like horses?,Curious to dive deeper
1339," No, although I do appreciate them. I wouldn't say they are one of my favorite animals. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1339,I grew up with them.  So I'm a little impartial.  When I had them growing up I didn't care for them.  Now that I'm older though I didn't realize how blessed I was to have them.,Happy
1339,I do like the horses from the Budweiser commercials lol. I'm not a fan of horse racing or anything like that. Isn't it kind of cruel to race them?,Curious to dive deeper
1339," lol Yes. They really take a beating.  Those poor horses live a terrible life.  I live near an Amish community and a lot of the retired race horses that didn't make big money end up being resold to the Amish market to pull their buggies around.  It's sad.  Icelandic horses have a fifth speed called tolt, which is basically speedwalking for a horse.  I just found that out.",Sad
1339,That's cool. I'm actually glad to hear they get to have a meaningful life after. I thought they might just be used for breeding than disregarded after racing. I didn't even know horses had different levels of speed.,Surprised
1339," Oh yes...most have 3 speeds....walk, trot, and cantering or loping.  lol  Dalmations are associated with firefighters because they would calm and protect the horses back in the days before fire departments had motorized vehicles.",Happy
1339,I guess that's why we always see them together in commercials and things like that. I think most racehorses can be traced back to one particular horse. That's pretty wild.,Surprised
1339,Yes!  That is pretty interesting.  I've heard that before.  Clint Eastwood developed a mid-life allergy to horses which is ironic because he spent so much time on horseback in all the Westerns he did in the first part of his career.,Happy
1339,He must have used short haired horses. I heard that the length of a horses hair is determined by sunlight.,Neutral
1339,That is pretty interesting. I never knew that.  Speaking of horse hair... Lipizzaner horses (the ones that you see in dressage contests) are born black or brown and take about 6 years to turn completely white.,Happy
1339,Did you ever try to tickle a horse when you were growing up?,Curious to dive deeper
1339,Hahaha No. What's that all about?,Curious to dive deeper
1339," Well apparently they are one of a few animals that are ticklish like humans. I think horses, sharks an orangutans are all ticklish lol",Happy
1339,How neat!  Switching topics...are you a fan of clothing?  I am.  I try to wear it as much as I can.  lol,Happy
1339," I do to try stay clothed myself lol. I try to stay trendy, but you definitely won't catch me watching Project Runway or anything like that. It is fascinating how humans are the only species to decide to use clothing.",Neutral
1339,Yes! lol  I was surprised to find out that Pilgrims wore clothing that was full of color and not just black and white.,Happy
1339,Yea isn't the black and white just their formal wear? Yet that's how we remember them.,Curious to dive deeper
1339,Yes.  I always saw them depicted wearing black and white in school.  I was surprised to see that Apple had a clothing line back in 1986.  Why would they get into clothing?,Surprised
1339,Well back then Apple wasn't the giant that it is now and was struggling to compete with Microsoft. Did you know people used to do laundry in old faithful?,Curious to dive deeper
1339,No. haha I wonder how many people got their clothes shot up in the air and blew away! lol  It's been fun chatting!,Happy
1340," Hello,  have you ever watch the movie Titanic?",Curious to dive deeper
1340," I did, I watched it on 1997 when it first come out and at least a couple more times, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1340," Yes,  I have seen it great movie!  ",Curious to dive deeper
1340," It is a great movie, it made me cry more than once lol, an epic romance and then disaster film",Curious to dive deeper
1340," The romance part was kinda corny to me.  To see the events that happened and see it re lived on film was incredibly sad,  you always read about it or know what happened but to see it with your own eyes was devastating.  It was a well done movie. ",Curious to dive deeper
1340," It was sad, the titanic still rests at the bottom of the sea, it's being eaten slowly by bacteria and some day it will be gone",Sad
1340," yeah I think predicted at 15-20 years it will be gone,  thats so weird.  Did you know that the movie titanic cost more than the actual boat?",Curious to dive deeper
1340," I didnt know that, it must had been a really expensive movie to make, specially back in the day when budgets werent so big for movies,",Curious to dive deeper
1340,Yeah.  Have you seen black panther?,Curious to dive deeper
1340," I have, I though it was a great movie as well, the leading character nailed the role, he was pretty good",Curious to dive deeper
1340," It was a good movie,  kinda slow at first,  I love all the vibrant colors though.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1340," It did have a slow beginning good thing it picked up later, did you know he is actually the richest Superhero, both in the DC and Marvel universes!",Curious to dive deeper
1340," Yeah,  he owns a country!  ",Curious to dive deeper
1340," When you put it that way it makes sense, but still he owns more money than Stark and Bruce Wayne combined and multiplyed by 2.5",Curious to dive deeper
1340,That is really wealthy lol,Curious to dive deeper
1340," It is, I wish a had a hundreth part of that, even less lol did you hear about Chadwick Boseman and how he paid for university",Curious to dive deeper
1340,Yeah he couldnt afford to go so denzel washington ended up privately funding him.,Curious to dive deeper
1340," I think Denzel has a great heart, he funded his carreer and then its a good think Boseman thanked him",Curious to dive deeper
1340,Anything you wish that was real in the movie?  I really like their medical healing machine!,Curious to dive deeper
1340," I wish that was real as well, and also having a hero like Black Panther would be sweet",Curious to dive deeper
1340," lol its been good chatting,  have a good one. ",Neutral
1340," Marvel censored a part of the movie, and its been nice chatting as well",Curious to dive deeper
1341," Hi, how are you?",Happy
1341," Doing alright. Are you a NBA fan? James Harden is having a great season, he actually outscored the entire Clippers team in one quarter",Curious to dive deeper
1341,I am an NBA fan. He's having such a crazy month stretch! Do you like the NBA?,Curious to dive deeper
1341," Yea but I only have time to read about the game or watch highlights, like Harden's 25 points against the Rockets",Neutral
1341," Yeah, the response he is getting from twitter and other players is crazy. They are appreciating the work he is doing. I think he went for 61 last night against the Knicks.",Curious to dive deeper
1341,Yea that's crazy but he might be getting away with some traveling and push-offs that refs aren't calling,Neutral
1341,That and some carries! Harden has shown some real confidence in his game this season. There's no chance he wont win the MVP this season.,Happy
1341," Yea, I don't see how Lebron can win, especially since he's been out awhile with a groin injury while Harden is playing his mind out",Neutral
1341," His success makes me feel even worse for Melo Anthony. He couldn't succeed there, he may not succeed anymore with his antiquated game. Sad...",Sad
1341,Maybe a team that wants to tank will take Carmelo despite the fact Adam Silver wants teams to stop tanking,Neutral
1341," As a Chicago fan, I am not sure I would like him to suit up for us. I would prefer to just cut or waive him.",Sad
1341," Yea, he should just retire, he isn't a good fit with any of the 30 NBA teams",Neutral
1341," No, I guess LA is the front runner though. If he didn't have any friends in the NBA, the NBA equivilant to Barry Bonds, would he have even been signed this year? I fear not. It sounds like his friends are keeping him employed.",Curious to dive deeper
1341," He's just a shell of himself now and in denial about it, maybe he needs the money though since 60% of NBA player become broke after retiring",Neutral
1341," At least he doesn't have a great game only to be overshadowed by his big sister, cough***Reggie Miller***Cough",Happy
1341," No but that still isn't as bad as turning down a 10% stake in Nike for 100,000 like Spencer Haywood",Surprised
1341,Not smart! Spencer Haywood did that? Im surprised they offered that stake for SPENCER HAYWOOD!,Surprised
1341," I guess it all worked out in the end, Haywood got $100,000 instead of an ownership stake of 8.62 billion",Neutral
1341,Who was advising him? They should not be able to work with athletes any more. That company has been a giant since 86.,Curious to dive deeper
1341," I don't know, it happened roughly 30 years ago so maybe his agent hated him",Neutral
1341,HAHAHA. That's a funny theory! He said no to Nike and told him to shoot granny style...,Happy
1341," Lol, well i gtg, nice talking with you",Neutral
1342,I have all of the streaming sites and i wish my son would help me pay for it lol,Happy
1342," I've heard that it's a trend for young people to password share, something like 42% of those 21 and under apparently do it.",Neutral
1342,Amazon Prime Video is just not worth the money to me,Disgusted
1342," I agree; $14.99 a month may not seem like much, but I would rather spend it on something else.  ",Neutral
1342," we do password share on hulu, but we have live tv with the works and share the price",Happy
1342," Do you watch a lot of tv?  I don't often get a chance to, but I do like Stranger Things when I get the chance to see it.  It's definitely different.",Neutral
1342,I am going to check that out. I love almost every show on netflix,Happy
1342,It's hard to imagine that Netflix is worth over $2 billion dollars.  That's a lot people just hanging out watching tv. :),Happy
1342,i believe it. They just raised my bill by 2 dollars,Angry
1342," Did you ever get into The Sopranos?  That was so big years ago.  I never saw it, but I guess it was supposed to be ""compelling.""",Neutral
1342,That is one of my all time favorite shows. I pay for hbo just for that.,Happy
1342,Really?  Then it must be good!  How about Curb Your Enthusiasm?  Isn't Larry David connected to Seinfeld in some way?  That was an excellent show.,Curious to dive deeper
1342,I think so. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is one of the funniest shows ever.,Happy
1342," The women in that was on The Office, wasn't she?  I just realized that I know more about shows from reading about them than I do from watching them.  That's kind of ironic.  ",Curious to dive deeper
1342,Yes she was kelly on the office.  people must stay in shape working for amazon,Neutral
1342," Yeah, that would be a physically demanding and fast-paced job.  But I wouldn't mind walking 7 to 15 miles per day for work, if the pay was decent, that is.",Neutral
1342,I have been ordering from amazon from the start. back in 95,Happy
1342,It's so convenient.  It passed Wal-Mart in 2015 as the most valuable retailer in the U.S.  I don't think it will give up that title soon.,Neutral
1342,I like it because i get my packages on sundays,Happy
1342," Yes, that is a great perk!  The contract that Amazon has with the USPS is win-win-win for everyone involved.",Neutral
1342,Stranger things seems cool. The 11 character seems cool,Curious to dive deeper
1343," Hello,  have you seen the movie Titanic?",Curious to dive deeper
1343," Hi! Yes I have seen it a long time ago, is it a real event?",Curious to dive deeper
1343," yes it is.  Although,  the love story was probably added,  I dont think that love story actually happened",Curious to dive deeper
1343,Oh my! It's a good thing that the titanic had more lifeboats than legally required! I wonder why they decided to add more lifeboats?,Curious to dive deeper
1343," hmmmm,  I am pretty sure it had less lifeboats than required,  thats why so many people died. ",Curious to dive deeper
1343," Oh, the theme song is one of my all time favorite songs! The first movie about the film was released just a month after its sinking, there are more than one Titanic films?",Curious to dive deeper
1343,I have only seen the one.  Its so crazy to see what everyone went through while the boat was losing integrity.  So sad to see all those people lose their lives.  Yes the song was good.,Curious to dive deeper
1343," Yeah even in those tough times, some people were cordial enough to let women and children get on the life boats first. There's even a sims version of the Titanic, I never played that game, wonder if there's a monopoly version.",Curious to dive deeper
1343," Oh wow never knew that,  I never played the sims either.  Did you know the titanic is slowly being eaten away at the moment?  Its predicted to be completely gone in 15-20 years. ",Curious to dive deeper
1343,Oh really? No scientist or museums are trying to preserve it? Is the ship still underseas?,Surprised
1343,Yeah the ship is still at the bottom of the ocean where it sunk.  I hear the founder of Hersheys candies was suppose to sail back home on the titanic but his plans changed !  crazy!,Curious to dive deeper
1343," Oh my goodness, we wouldn't have had Hersheys! But the other crazy part is thinking about that ships were the main form of traveling vs airplanes today! We have come a long way since then",Surprised
1343," yeah thats really weird  I cant imagine having to travel by boat all the time,  also it takes so long. ",Curious to dive deeper
1343," Yeah! Wonder if in the future we'd travel like the ways the Wakanda people traveled in Black Panther, have you seen that movie?",Curious to dive deeper
1343," Yes I have seen that move,  that would be pretty cool.  although,  id really rather have that healing bay thing rather than fast travel lol ",Curious to dive deeper
1343,Oh my! That was pretty awesome! Imagine all the medical bills and pain we'd save! Do you have a favorite character?,Curious to dive deeper
1343," I forgot her name but Tchalla's sister,  the lady who works in the lab,  she is awesome!  How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1343," Oh yeah! I know exactly who you're talking about, me too, she's my favorite! She's fierce and smart and tech savvy too! Even with simple themes like challenging the king's sovereignty in Black Panther, Marvel is able to make it so entertaining!",Surprised
1343,Did you know Black panther is the richest super hero?,Curious to dive deeper
1343," Oh wow, I didn't know that, Chadwich Boseman, the main character was accepted into a prestigious summer program but couldn't afford to go and turns out Denzel Washington secured funding for him, what a small world!",Surprised
1343,Thats pretty amazing.  Its been good chatting!,Curious to dive deeper
1344,Do you know a lot about the sun and moon?,Neutral
1344," I know a little bit about both bodies. The moon is Earth's satellite and is tidally locked to us, resulting in us seeing only one face of the moon as it reflects the sun's light.",Curious to dive deeper
1344,Did you know we almost put a un flag instead of an american one on the moon?,Surprised
1344," Although such a thing might have been considered by the U.S. government, it certainly was less of a priority than showing United States supremacy during the height of the Cold War against the U.S.S.R. Speaking of the sun, if only we could harness more of the energy that comes from the sun to power the earth. The sun produces enough energy in one second to supply all of the earth's energy needs for 500,000 years. Really amazing!",Happy
1344,And the sun is only 1/billion the size of the biggest star. Imagine how much energy that produces,Neutral
1344," With the sheer amount of energy the sun produces, all that energy must come from somewhere. The sun is 1.39 million km in diameter, which is 109 times that of earth. It also is 330,000 times more massive than the earth, and, in fact, makes up 99.86% of the mass in the solar system.",Curious to dive deeper
1344," True, yet a lightening bolt is still hotter than the surface of the sun. How on earth do people survive?",Neutral
1344," Well, the earth does have a lot of surface area, and since lightning needs a ground to attract its strike, most people are smart enough to get out of the way, and into cover. Regarding the moon, I just learned that its highest point is 1,938 meters higher than Mt. Everest on earth. For comparison, it's hard to imagine, Mt. Everest an addition 25% higher.",Neutral
1344," Given less gravity, I wonder if it would be harder or easier to climb given all the gear and limitations on the moon",Neutral
1344," I would imagine it would be harder in the sense that normal earth climbing gear would have to be adapted to the moon's unique challenges. It's a good thing the moon has a dense core; it's the second densest in the solar system, unlike Phobos, which is hollow.",Curious to dive deeper
1344," It is shame though that moon dust is a hazard to humans, able to cut through kevlar and causing moon hay fever",Neutral
1344," That's why it may be helpful to send more robots on solar exploration, rather than humans. Although, there is something quite remarkable for humans to accomplish. It's sad, but also amazing, that the Mars Opportunity Rover is finally ""dead."" It was only on a 90 day mission, but lasted over 15 years. NASA is amazing.",Happy
1344,I guess that is why so many people are interested in drone and AI research.,Neutral
1344," Yes, the world is quickly changing, with new technologies always on the horizon. But, part of me misses ""old things,"" like vinyl albums. I still have my record of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, but I don't have a record player anymore! Crazy, right?",Surprised
1344,I guess many people have the songs transcribed into digital files instead. I think there is a value to the classics as well. I mean the dark side of the moon is still among the best sellers despite being released decades prior,Neutral
1344," Absolutely popular, which I understand, since it's still musically great. That's what makes me wonder how Linkin Park's ""Hybrid Theory"" is the best-selling album of the 21st century. I mean, really? Not that I am a fan of Taylor Swift, but I would think she could outsell Linkin Park any day of the week.",Surprised
1344,Perhaps. Nwa's straight outta compton is another great contender as it has reach platinum status without even a major tour,Neutral
1344,A really strange fact is that a set of identical twins from Japan released a rap album in 1992 at the age of 100 years old.,Curious to dive deeper
1344,That must have been meaningful for those twins. I applaud them.,Neutral
1344," You mentioned that most people have digital files of their music. It seems that even that is going by the wayside with apps like Pandora, Spotify and the like where everything is in the cloud. Independent artists can use Soundcloud too to showcase their talents.",Curious to dive deeper
1344," I think it is because it is much easier to carry around data with the speed technology is advancing than carrying around physical albums. I admit however, that generally it is a bit inferior in quality to the physical copies, but you can find equal quality as originals but just with much bigger file size",Neutral
1344," It's unfortunate that the United States is so behind when it comes to fiber-optic technology. It caps our data speeds, especially uploading. It would be nice if there was more concerted effort to increase this capacity. Too bad Google Fiber didn't work out.",Curious to dive deeper
1344," I agree. Hopefully, the US will put more effort into updating infrastructure and technology across the board rather than doing meaningless political shows. In any case, thank you for the intriguing chat.",Neutral
1345,do you like listening to albums?,Curious to dive deeper
1345,Yes I do. Did you ever listen to Hybrid Theory?,Curious to dive deeper
1345,Yes it is the best selling album of the century after all,Curious to dive deeper
1345,Yes true. DO you know which was the best album of 2014?,Curious to dive deeper
1345,That was the dark side of the moon which was released 40 years prior,Curious to dive deeper
1345,Yeah Straight Outta Campton was certified platinum even though there was not much airpolay or such,Curious to dive deeper
1345," Yeah, talk about letting the quality speak for itself",Curious to dive deeper
1345,Yeah I know. Twins in Japan released a rap album when they were 100,Curious to dive deeper
1345,Wow cool. DO you know much about the sun?,Curious to dive deeper
1345,Some stuff. I know that it is white but we see it as yellow,Curious to dive deeper
1345,Yes that is all because of atmospheric scattering,Curious to dive deeper
1345,Yes. The sun is hot but a lightning bolt is 5 times hotter than it,Curious to dive deeper
1345,Yes that is crazy and the sun is so hot we only need 1 second of its energy for 500 000 years,Curious to dive deeper
1345,Yeah so now imagine how hot a lightning bolt is,Curious to dive deeper
1345,I know right?Did you know Neptune takes forever to orbit around the sun?,Curious to dive deeper
1345,Yes it was discovered in 1846 and completed its first one in 2011,Curious to dive deeper
1345,Yeah forever. DO you know big is the sun compared to other stars?,Curious to dive deeper
1345,Yes it is one billionth of the size of the largest star,Curious to dive deeper
1345,Yeah. How much do you know about the moon?,Curious to dive deeper
1345,I know that there might be methane in one of the moons of Saturn,Curious to dive deeper
1345,That is so cool. Nice chatting with you today.,Curious to dive deeper
1345," Same here, take care",Happy
1346,Do you ever keep up on what the Rollings Stones do nowadays?,Curious to dive deeper
1346,Not much. I know from time to time the stars will make their way back into the media but not so sure what for,Curious to dive deeper
1346,I guess Keith Richards and Mick Jagger have an interesting relationship with each other,Curious to dive deeper
1346," seems that way, they are friend and then insult each other. very rocky relationship",Surprised
1346," Apparently the most recent problem is that Mick Jagger is having an eighth child even though he's 73, and Richards mentioned that he should consider a vasectomy",Surprised
1346,oh wow that is really personal though. DO you have a favorite album from them?,Surprised
1346,I don't really listen to their music. Are you familiar with the album Dark Side of the Moon?,Neutral
1346,is it still the best selling album although it has been released so many years ago?,Curious to dive deeper
1346," I heard it was still a best seller in 2014. ""Hybrid Theory by Linkin Park is one of the best selling of this century",Surprised
1346," they were such a great band, what a shame for what happened",Sad
1346,I know. I think it would be interesting to listen to a rap album that was released from twins in Japan. Apparently they did it when they turned 100,Curious to dive deeper
1346," wowww good for them, what determination. do you know the album straight outta compton by NWA?",Curious to dive deeper
1346," I've heard of it. I guess most people liked it so much that without airplay and a tour, it reached platinum status",Surprised
1346," now that is what i call achievement, good for them",Curious to dive deeper
1346," Another story of determination is when Reel Big Fish released a best of album. They lost the rights to the originals to the old record label, so they re-recorded all their hits",Surprised
1346," yes, that is another great example. on another topic, do you know much about the sun?",Curious to dive deeper
1346," I've heard that though it seems yellow to us due to atmospheric scattering, it is actually white",Surprised
1346,yeah. and it is so hot that in one second we can get all the energy we need for the entire planet for 500 000 years,Surprised
1346,That's a lot of energy! And to think that it is only one billionth in size compared to the largest star we know of in our galaxy,Surprised
1346,exactly. as hot as the sun is a lightning bolt is still hotter than the sun,Surprised
1346," Imagine the energy we could harness if we could capture the heat from lightning. The sun also contains a lot of mass, about 99.86% of the total in the Solar System",Surprised
1346," that is huge, just huge. it was nice chatting with you",Happy
1347,Do you have a favorite album?,Curious to dive deeper
1347,I do not as I do not listen to music very often. What about you?,Curious to dive deeper
1347," Same, but when i do it is definitely linkin park. Their hybrid theory album kicked butt!",Curious to dive deeper
1347,Ah. Thom Yorke played the laptop on some radiohead albums.,Surprised
1347," That is awesome, I never knew that!  I love radiohead. Linkin park is the #1 album in the 21st century",Curious to dive deeper
1347,Areosmith made more money from guitar hero than from any other album! I found that surprising.,Surprised
1347," that is very surprising, and kind of sad I think. Unless it was sooo much money and their album making soo much money also",Curious to dive deeper
1347,"  Yes, and Walmart will only sell albums if the author decides to make a clean version of it.",Happy
1347," that is crazy, they are messing up even more potential profits",Curious to dive deeper
1347,Yes. Did you know that the sun makes up 99.86% of our solar systems mass?,Surprised
1347," that is nuts! I never knew that. I know the sun produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500,000 years!!",Curious to dive deeper
1347,Although we would need a dyson sphere in order to capture all of that energy.,Sad
1347," That sounds straight out a marvels comic movie lol, do they exist?",Curious to dive deeper
1347," No, and there is not even enough material on earth to cover up the sun. Did you know that the sunset on mars is blue?",Curious to dive deeper
1347,that would be beautiful. Is there any video of that from the mars rover? I would love to see that!,Curious to dive deeper
1347," So would I, just imagine our sunset but looking at it through a blue filter.",Happy
1347," that is a good point, I bet even better of a sunset.  Crazy to think our sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star in our galaxy",Curious to dive deeper
1347,And there  is so much more to be explored in the Universe!,Happy
1347,right! I cant believe that. I also can't believe that Neptun just completed its first full orbit of the sun since 1846!,Curious to dive deeper
1347," Speaking of rotations, the equator of the sun rotates faster than the poles.",Surprised
1347," wow, that is interesting to think. It makes my head spin thinking of that! It was so nice chatting with you, have a great weekend!",Curious to dive deeper
1348,hello my friend do you play the piano?,Curious to dive deeper
1348,I do not. Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
1348," I do actually, it is a stringed instrument and created around the year 1700, I've only been playing for a couple years though",Curious to dive deeper
1348," Nice. If you reach the highest point of Britain, there's a piano there you can play!",Happy
1348," haha ok I'll check it out! I want to play the piano from the Hindenburg, it was made of aluminum and only weight like 400 lbs",Surprised
1348,The movers would appreciate that! There's a famous piano Freddie Mercury used and Paul McCartney!,Surprised
1348,Wow that is cool! That is the piano I want to play. They used it to record Hey Jude!,Surprised
1348,That's a pretty famous piano! They should take that one to the Smithsonian!,Surprised
1348," or give it to me, haha, cool that there is a song made specifically for stress testing pianos and it is not playable by humans",Surprised
1348,I kinda wanna listen to it on Spotify. Is that weird?,Curious to dive deeper
1348,haha no check it out! do you ever visit teh website reddit btw?,Curious to dive deeper
1348,Not really. Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
1348," ya I go there every day, kind of wild some of the original investors were famous people like Snoog Dogg and Peter Thiel",Surprised
1348,That is strange. I cannot believe their valuation was $1.8B!,Surprised
1348," Right! And I think it only started in about 2014, so its really not that old. Maybe there will be another competitor someday!",Curious to dive deeper
1348," Probably... There always seems to be something new that pops up, like the redditor...",Surprised
1348," yup true, pretty funny the first reddit post was about the site going downhill, thats typical reddit for you right there",Surprised
1348,I would love to read the page that sums up the kindest 25 things done on reddit.,Happy
1348," ya that would be inspiring, not inspiring is that only half a percent of people actually vote in the reddit polls",Surprised
1348,That's not a lot. Almost as much as a local election!,Happy
1348," hahah that is true, can you believe that reddit has half a billion monthly vistors and in a year about 1.2 billion comments?",Surprised
1348,Wow! Nice chatting with you!,Happy
1349,Hi.  Do you play the piano?,Curious to dive deeper
1349," I used to, but I was never very good. How about you?",Neutral
1349,Same here.  I took lessons as a kid and then stopped playing.,Neutral
1349," But as an instrument, I feel the music and sound when hammers strike the strings is beautiful",Happy
1349,It is definitely a beautiful instrument.  Apparently a group of climbers found a piano at the top of Briatin's highest mountain in 2006,Curious to dive deeper
1349,I guess someone just had to be the first to play a piano so high up. I think there are music that enhance nature's beauty,Neutral
1349,I'm sure that would be a really cool setting to play the piano.  Wonder how they got it up there?  Those things can be heavy,Neutral
1349,Either piece by piece of by a chopper,Neutral
1349,There was an aluminum grand piano on the hindenburg.  It weighed 356 pounds,Curious to dive deeper
1349,Did you know there is a song solely written to stress test pianos?,Neutral
1349," No, I didn't know that.  It is not even playable by humans.  Crazy",Curious to dive deeper
1349," I agree. In any case, you can find out more crazy stuff about pianos on the internet",Neutral
1349," Yep.  And in case the Internet ever burns down, you could go too the current library of Alexandria -  they saved a copy",Happy
1349,I wonder how often they update the copy,Neutral
1349,Good question.  That's gotta be a giant hard drive.,Curious to dive deeper
1349," I do enjoy using the internet, but I worry the constant novelty does cause addiction.",Sad
1349,Addiction is a big problem.  I try to spend some time every day outside away from any screens.  It's good for your mental health,Neutral
1349,It is nice to bask in the sunlight and just relax outside. When it isn't freezing cold of course,Neutral
1349,Of course.  Though it's not full proof.  You can get cell service on top of Mt Everest,Happy
1349,I mean that is one place you would want connection to make calls for help or look up information,Neutral
1349,Right lol.  You need to google how to get more Oxygen,Happy
1349,They probably also have to learn how to properly ascend or descend to avoid altitude sickness,Neutral
1349,Very true.  Nice chatting.  Have a good day!,Neutral
1350,Hi did you see the Black Panther movie?,Curious to dive deeper
1350,I did and loved it. Did you know he is the wealthiest superhero?,Curious to dive deeper
1350," Yeah even beating Tony Stark and Batman, for a whooping $500 billion",Curious to dive deeper
1350,Yeah that is a lot. How about DIsney movies?,Curious to dive deeper
1350," I like many of them actually, DO you know the real name of Minnie Mouse?",Curious to dive deeper
1350,Yes it is Minerva but I like Minnie better,Curious to dive deeper
1350,Me too. THey have a culture there where they hide mickey stuff on all things disney,Curious to dive deeper
1350,Hmm creative. Do you know who Bill Nye is?,Curious to dive deeper
1350,Yeah that is the Science Guy and he worked with disney on the Flubber,Curious to dive deeper
1350,Yeah that is pretty neat. Do you know what the name wall-e is a tribute to?,Curious to dive deeper
1350," Yeah it was in tribute to Walter Elias Disney, how sweet of them",Curious to dive deeper
1350,I know. Do you use facebook at all?,Curious to dive deeper
1350,I do sometimes. DO you know when it was founded?,Curious to dive deeper
1350,I want to say in the early 2000 but not sure exactly. Did you use Myspace ever?,Curious to dive deeper
1350,Yes it was 2004. Yes I used Myspace for a bit before facebook era,Curious to dive deeper
1350,Yeah too bad they did not buy facebook when they could for just $75 million,Curious to dive deeper
1350,Exactly. Do you know why it is blue?,Curious to dive deeper
1350,Because Mark is colorbling and cannot see green and red,Curious to dive deeper
1350,Yes. The like button seems to be illegal in parts of Germany.,Curious to dive deeper
1350," Hmm wonder why. In Iceland they are using it for something big, do you know what?",Curious to dive deeper
1350,Yes to rewrite the constitution. Pretty crazy.,Curious to dive deeper
1351," Hi, how are you?",Happy
1351,I'm doing amazing are you a fan of the marvel superhero films?,Curious to dive deeper
1351,I am. Are you?,Curious to dive deeper
1351,I love marvel my favorite films are the first iron man and the second spiderman film from like 2004. What are your favorites?,Curious to dive deeper
1351,I like black panther. I think it was expertly cast and even better execution.,Happy
1351," Omg yes, Black panther and the newest avengers movies have been my current favorites in the marvel film universe. The visuals on balck panther were top notch",Happy
1351,Yeah! I do not know how they will come back from the ending of the most recent Avengers. Did you see it? Can I ask you questions about it without spoiling it?,Curious to dive deeper
1351,Go ahead dont worry about any spoilers lol,Surprised
1351,How can they bring all of those people back that Thanos killed? I mean he killed almost half of the avengers and super heros? Is flash (I know DC) going to spin the world back in time?,Curious to dive deeper
1351,They're probably going to do the classic comic book thing where they say that they only killed them in this universe but there are many univereses like the famous Earth 616,Happy
1351,That makes sense but I do not like it. Just beat him before he gets the infinity stones...,Fearful
1351,I think spiderman had a woman who could like spin the webs of time or something so maybe they could do something with that,Curious to dive deeper
1351,It is a pretty messy thing to come back from. This is usually where the movie jumps the shark (so to speak).,Sad
1351,Which actor do you think played the best spiderman? the first the second or this newest one?,Happy
1351,I think the first one was the best because he was the first. I think Andrew Garfield is great though!,Happy
1351," You are the best, I completely agree toby maguire is the best rendition it was just believable from him. Andrew garfield did a great job also this new guy is going to take some getting used to",Curious to dive deeper
1351," Did you see the newest one, the cartoon with multiple universes?",Curious to dive deeper
1351,Nope but it actually got some pretty good reviews,Curious to dive deeper
1351,I would like to see it. It got nominated for a few awards.,Curious to dive deeper
1351,What did you think about the venom movie with tom hardy?,Curious to dive deeper
1351,I never saw it. Any good?,Curious to dive deeper
1351,Its not close to the spiderman films but i can definitely tell you its better then any rendition ben affleck did of batman lol,Happy
1351,HA! That's not setting the bar very high.,Happy
1351,It was a great chat today look up the comedian Joey Diaz he was in spiderman 2 and he's always on joe rogans podcast on youtube he's going to make you laugh alot,Curious to dive deeper
1352," Dementia can be a cruel disease, I have seen it closely",Curious to dive deeper
1352," Yes, I have too. It takes away everything, even things you wouldn't think you could forget like playing the piano.",Sad
1352," Its a sad thing to go through, it seems like Jenna's father was a skilled player and then dementia happened",Curious to dive deeper
1352,Who's Jenna? Do you play piano? They've been around since about the year 1700 so there is such an interesting history behind them.,Curious to dive deeper
1352," Jenna Glanzer is a woman that has 27 years, she has a dad with dementia and she tells the story of how her dad needs help identifying songs",Curious to dive deeper
1352," Oh, I'm not really familiar with her. I do know a lot about pianos though. I'll have to look her up on the internet.",Curious to dive deeper
1352," So you know a lot about pianos, is that right, cool tell me an interesting fact about them",Curious to dive deeper
1352,Sure. A long time ago there were steam pianos. They were so loud you could hear them miles away.,Surprised
1352," How cool is that! almost as cool as the piano that was found on top of Britains highest mountain, how did it get there!!!",Surprised
1352,That one I don't know unfortunately. Lots of people play who you wouldn't think of as piano players. Richard Nixon played his own concerto on the tonight show once.,Surprised
1352," He did? Nixon is full of surprises there is an aluminum piano, I  wonder if Nixon ever played it",Curious to dive deeper
1352,Yeah I bet he probably did. Piano players have some weird connections. Mozart and Haydn both owned pianos made from the same tree. Not sure who got it first.,Curious to dive deeper
1352," Maybe the piano had something to do with their level of skill lol, Mozart and Haydn were both great composers, ",Happy
1352,Yeah. Actually there are all kinds of reddit and subreddit discussions on pianos. It's quite a discussed topic on the busy website.,Curious to dive deeper
1352,Do you use reddit a lot? its a site that moves a lot of money although it doesnt seem that way,Curious to dive deeper
1352," I do and you're right. They do a good job of not cluttering it with ads, but still make a lot of money. It's because it gets so much traffic. They estimate 542 million visits a month!",Surprised
1352,542 million visits!!!! thats insane!! there is a free magazine based on reddit as well,Curious to dive deeper
1352," Yeah, it's actually the 6th most visited website in the world. It seems popular but not that popular, you don't hear about it in the news as much as say facebook.",Curious to dive deeper
1352," Yeah the 6th worldwide and 3rd in the US, most users come from the US though about 58% of them",Curious to dive deeper
1352,Now they are apparently worth 1.8 billion although I wouldn't be surprised to see that go up.,Surprised
1352," Yeah, companies like that tend to grow although it could also go down. ",Curious to dive deeper
1353,You ever heard of Reddit?,Curious to dive deeper
1353," ah I have, I like it there are some subreddits I like  the fasting section, waht about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1353,I never heard of it before. Tell me about it please!,Curious to dive deeper
1353," well the fasting section tells you about prolonged fasting, it's how I lost 50 lbs!",Curious to dive deeper
1353," Nice! I did a 20-day water only fast last year, which was wonderful, but I did not lose 50 lbs. Congratulations to you! So, is Reddit like a bunch of bloggers, writing on topics, or what?",Curious to dive deeper
1353," thank you haha, and ya it's like, you can make a subreddit for any topic, and any user can post about it. It's always updated with new info by users",Curious to dive deeper
1353," Is it something people can make an income from, or is it just a social thing?",Curious to dive deeper
1353," no I don't think you can make money with it, its more just social and you can get good information with it, I guess there is a free online magazine that is based on reddit as well, so that is free so ya I don't think you could make much on there",Surprised
1353," Sounds neat. Does everyone that visit the site participate in contributing content, or are most just browsing?",Curious to dive deeper
1353," I think the vast majority of people just consume the content they don't create it, like I know that only half a percent of people actually vote on reddit",Curious to dive deeper
1353,OK. People are so cynical these days. I would imagine that a lot of the comments are complaints. Am I right?,Curious to dive deeper
1353," ya it is very politically charged, people get very opinionated, I think the first post of reddit was even complaining about reddit haha so theres that too",Curious to dive deeper
1353," Figures. But is sounds pretty powerful. Now the biggest question of the day: Does it have hamburger buttons on each page? You know, that symbol with those three horizontal lines that link to a menu... That is the mark a truly fine site!",Curious to dive deeper
1353," haha the hamburger button makes me hungry! I have seen that button I never knew what it was called, have you ever wanted to climb mount Everest?",Curious to dive deeper
1353," No, but I would enjoy a helicopter ride to the top. I hear there is 3g signal up there. I may have to wait for 5g.",Happy
1353,haha ya 3g might not be able to snapchat from up there! do you use the internet a lot? I guess there is place where they keep a saved copy of the internet,Curious to dive deeper
1353," Yeah, at the  Library of Alexandria I think. I wonder what amount of the space is taken up by Reddit? ",Happy
1353," haha ya I wonder how many TB's of storage that takes up, and like how often do they update it? do you know anything about that",Curious to dive deeper
1353," No, but it's gotta contain tons of info. In this ""information age"" with so much happening and being posted online and blurted out by the media every day, it is hard to believe that in 1930, the BBC one day there was no news worth broadcasting, so they just played piano all day!  I like that. Next day I feel overwhelmed, I think I'll take a piano day!",Happy
1353," wow that's cool, I play piano personally do you play any instruments?",Curious to dive deeper
1353," I play guitar, and I have started to learn piano, but I am a novice. I enjoy old Beatles songs and some of the stuff done by Queen. Hey, did you know that the same piano used by McCartney to record, ""Hey Jude"" was also used by Freddie Murcury to record Bohemian Rhapsody?",Happy
1353," wow that's cool, and I guess at the top of britains highest mountain they found a piano! Like how did it get there?",Surprised
1354,Are you on facebook?,Curious to dive deeper
1354," I am, for what it feels like is all the time.  You?",Neutral
1354," Likewise lol, I can't get away from it! Did you know myspace had the chance to buy facebook in 2005",Curious to dive deeper
1354," Yeah, looks like they made a pretty bad decision as it is now worth 104 Billion.",Neutral
1354," right, is myspace even around anymore. They would have screwed it up somehow if they bought it i think",Curious to dive deeper
1354," Probably.  I used to have a Myspace profile back in ""the day"".  I checked out the site the other day because I was curious.  It is still there, but very different.  Big music focus now.",Neutral
1354," me too lol! I think the end of it was the music, I used to have a song playing when you entered my profile if I remember right lol",Curious to dive deeper
1354," You could, I think I remember being able to have a top 5 friends or something like that.",Neutral
1354,then they moved it to like 15 and I didn't feel bad having more lol. Have you heard of the burger king promotion that they ran regarding facebook>,Curious to dive deeper
1354," Yeah, I wish I took advantage of that.  I could eat a few whoppers for cleaning up the ol' book.",Neutral
1354,Me too lol. I think I could have go like 50 whoppers for the people I dropped off my friend list,Curious to dive deeper
1354,It would have been really cool if people cold have donated extra whoppers to the homeless.,Neutral
1354," I would have donated all of them! Did you see Iceland is using facebook to rewrite their constitution, how do you feel about that?",Curious to dive deeper
1354," I think its pretty cool to allow input from the people, and what a way to get it.   People will be involved that way.",Neutral
1354," Right, power of the people for sure! Did you watch Black Panther?",Curious to dive deeper
1354," I havent, I just saw it flipping through Netflix, so I am planning on watching soon!  I didnt know he was the richest superhero.",Neutral
1354," Watch it, it is really good. Apparently his wealth is like 500 billion dollars in that. I don't know how real that could be but for sure interesting!",Curious to dive deeper
1354,Did you hear about what the star Chadwick Boseman did for Denzel Washington?,Curious to dive deeper
1354," What did he do, I haven't heard?",Curious to dive deeper
1354,He had wanted to go to a theater program in Oxford but couldnt afford it so Denzel paid for him.  He thanked him in person at the premiere.,Neutral
1354," Wow, that is so amazing, I love those stories! It was so nice chatting with you, enjoy your night!",Curious to dive deeper
1355,Hello! The article I read was about the film Black Panther,Happy
1355,The Black Panther movie was predicted to be a really high opening movie.,Neutral
1355,There were alt-right groups which tried to form campaigns to leave negative reviews for Black Panther on rottentomatoes.com,Neutral
1355,That group didn't get a lot of support for their group to give it a rotten score.,Neutral
1355,A similar effort was attempted previously for the film The Last Jedi.,Neutral
1355," The rotten tomatoes said they wanted a place to debate movies, but they didn't condone hate speech.",Neutral
1355," The people behind the hate speech didn't like how Disney was offering films that had diverse casts, including women in leading roles.",Neutral
1355,Apparently Daisy Ridley as Rey had a feminist agenda. If you don't like a movie just don't go to it.,Disgusted
1355,Black Panther also had women in prominent roles.,Neutral
1355,Apparently they don't like Disney and its direction.,Neutral
1355,Rotten Tomatoes tried to monitor the opinions left and limit the input of the hate group if they posted hate speech.,Neutral
1355,They ended up shutting it down though.,Neutral
1355,The movie Black Panther went on to be very successful.,Neutral
1355," It was based on the Marvel Universe, and lots of the 17 films set there were successful.",Happy
1355," An example was Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2, which was very successful and made over $863 million the previous year.",Neutral
1355," It had a huge opening as well, $146 million domestic.  They predicted Black Panther to have opening number very close to that.",Happy
1355," Black Panther is the richest superhero, worth more than both Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne combined.",Neutral
1355,Isn't he crowned a king? Kings are always rich.,Neutral
1355," Yes he was crowned king after his father's death, and got all his wealth. ",Neutral
1355," Of course, if his adversary who challenged him had won, things would not have turned out to be so lucrative for him. ",Neutral
1355,True. But now he can use his wealth to end his country's isolationist practices and help others in need throughout the world.,Neutral
1355,I wonder if Chadwick Boseman will be in another film as black panther.,Curious to dive deeper
1356,Do you play Golf?,Neutral
1356,I have taken a few lessons but my family members play. Amazing that it does not have a standard playing area.,Curious to dive deeper
1356," Yes, you can get a completely unique experience each time you play",Neutral
1356,The average course uses over 300000 gallons of water a day. That is tremendous!,Surprised
1356,That is where Golf Courses really get a bad rap. They need to find ways to cut back on the water,Neutral
1356,Yes Especially the course in Dubai that uses over 4 million gallons a day. I did know that Samuel L Jackson has a clause in his contracts to play golf twice a week.,Curious to dive deeper
1356,That's silly. All courses should be limited to 9 holes to save space and water,Neutral
1356,Amazing that the courses in this country could cover two states! But it is nice to have green spaces in otherwise urban areas.,Neutral
1356,You have to be fairly good to get the ball in the 4.25 inch cup on the first try,Neutral
1356,So True? Are you a music fan? I enjoy concerts. Did you know that Linkin Park played 324 concerts in one year?,Curious to dive deeper
1356,Amazing. Abba turned down a lot of money to do relatively little work.,Neutral
1356,Can you believe that the old group the Ramones toured almost nonstop for 20 years?,Neutral
1356,That was concert life back in the day so I can see that happening for sure.,Neutral
1356,I also read that Pink Floyd recorded a live concert in an roman amphitheater in Pompeii with no audience. I wonder why? Why not just record in the studio?,Curious to dive deeper
1356,Maybe for the acoustics?,Curious to dive deeper
1356,That is true but they usually make so much money on the gate.  A Creed concert was sued because it was bad.,Curious to dive deeper
1356,Thats does not sound like Creed. I always was a big fan of theirs.,Neutral
1356," I dont know much about them. Are you interested in animals? I was reading facts and find it interesting that domesticated animals develop white patches on their foreheads. I guess like cats, dogs, and horses?",Curious to dive deeper
1356,I am not big on cats at all. I am allergic,Neutral
1356,I am sorry to hear that. Can you believe that Germany gives animals legal rights?,Curious to dive deeper
1356,Probably good idea for their protection.,Neutral
1357,Hi!  Do you like poetry?,Curious to dive deeper
1357,I am a huge literature lover. The aesthetic and rhythmic verses of poetry are music to my ears. How about you?,Happy
1357," I like them!  The Javanese alphabet, when recited in order, forms a poem!",Happy
1357,There is not nearly enough money to be made when creating these masterpieces. Poe only made $9 for The Raven.,Surprised
1357,I hope he didn't sell the rights to it! Yikes.  Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome poem!,Happy
1357,More money can be made in music. Albums have been around since the early 20th century.,Happy
1357,Yes!  Do you know who has the best selling album of the 21st Century?,Happy
1357,Linkin Park! I own hybrid theory. I'm so sad about Chester. Mental health is a serious issue.,Sad
1357,I agree. That was so sad.  Reel Big Fish re-recorded all of their hits for a best of album after losing the rights to their old record label.,Happy
1357,Good for them to fight for their music. Anotherfavorite of mine is NWA's straight outta compton. It was so good that it went platinum without touring.,Happy
1357,I remember when that came out.  Everyone was passing around their cassettes that they recorded of them. lol,Happy
1357,I still listen to NWA. Such great stuff there. Pink Floyd is another one that has stood the test of time. Dark side of the moon was one of the best selling albums in 2014.,Happy
1357,I saw that.  Pretty incredible it was still that popular more than 40 years after it was first released!,Happy
1357,Music is for all ages. Two 100 year old japanese women released a rap album in 1992.,Surprised
1357,What a way to celebrate a birthday at that age!  Have you ever voted in any elections?  I have.,Curious to dive deeper
1357,I have voted since I turned 18. It is our civic duty to do so. Taller candidates have won 75% of the time since 1900.,Happy
1357," Nice.  Me too and how interesting!  Nevada is the only state to have a ""none of these candidates"" voting option for presidential elections.",Happy
1357," I think everyone voting should have to vote for someone. I don't like the ""none"" option in Nevada.",Angry
1357,It's different that's for sure.  The voter turnout for US presidential elections hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years.  That's stunning to me.,Happy
1357,I wonder why more people don't vote? It is something I value doing so much. Have a nice day!,Sad
1357,It's crazy isn't it?  Have a nice day too!,Happy
1358," Hi, how are you? Do you think Donald Trump has had any effect on the arts?",Curious to dive deeper
1358," Well that is a very interesting question! I do think people have probably crafted their arts differently based on their political views, whether it be musically or creatively. Do you agree?",Curious to dive deeper
1358," I think so. I think writers, or poets, for example are finding themselves writing a lot darker than usual.",Neutral
1358," I agree. I didn't even realize political poetry was a thing, but apparently it is, so I'm sure how the author perceives the political climate affects their writing. That must be like a rollercoaster based on who is elected!",Curious to dive deeper
1358," I'm sure Trump, whether you love or hate him, is a constant source for inspiration, even up to the point of right before the artist goes on stage.",Neutral
1358,That is so true. Have you ever heard any spoken word poetry in person?,Curious to dive deeper
1358," Nope, have you? I think it would be cool to see something like Demetri Martin's 224 word palindrome performed live.",Curious to dive deeper
1358," I haven't either. Oh my gosh, Demetri Martin is hilarious. I've seen the video of that palindrome poem but never live. I think it's cool that poetry has been around since the 25th century BCE. It has evolved so much!",Happy
1358," I know, right? I wonder what Edgar Allan Poe would think if he knew how many students read ""The Raven"" after he only received $9 for the publication of it.",Curious to dive deeper
1358," Oh man, so true. I know there's some poem that was written that when you read it forward, it's very depressing but when you read it backwards it's inspiring. I think I read it one time.",Surprised
1358,What's also interesting is written poetry probably lead to lyrics and song. Thanks to that we have a lot of great albums in the 1900's and early 2000's.,Neutral
1358," Yeah, I don't care much for poetry but I absolutely love music. I know they're really tied together though. I love the old vinyls that came about in the 1940s, 1950s. I know we've since gone through audio cassettes and CDs and MP3s, but I think vinyl records are actually making a comeback.",Happy
1358," I actually collect Vinyl's. I have a huge digital collection, but if I really like something I'll buy the vinyl. I should get Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, that's missing from my collection.",Happy
1358,I put my record player away when I had kids but now that they're older I've been thinking about pulling it back out so they can really appreciate some music. Our local libraries have tons of vinyls at great prices. It's funny that Dark Side of the Moon was actually a best-selling album just a few years ago even though it was released over 40 years ago!,Surprised
1358," I bet vinyl sales are way higher than CDs now. By me, you can find stores that sell only new and old vinyls. Great sound quality!",Happy
1358,Oh I bet you are right! I didn't even think about new vinyls being created. Are people putting new stuff on both CDs and vinyls?,Curious to dive deeper
1358," Yes, I just got the Foo Fighter's album Sonic Highways last year. Really cool album. But on Amazon you can find any new album on vinyl now.",Neutral
1358,I had no idea! I guess I know just as little information about all that as I do politics. Do you pay any attention to elections and such?,Curious to dive deeper
1358," Yes, I do. The United States voter turnout is always so low, it's crazy. I love voting.",Surprised
1358," Same here. I may not keep up much with politics throughout the year but I try to educate myself at election time. Sometimes I wish my state was like Nevada, and I could check a ""none of these candidates"" box for presidential elections!",Surprised
1358,haha! you could always vote for yourself as a write-in!,Happy
1358,That would be pretty funny to do! Nice chatting with you!,Happy
1358,Same! Have a good night.,Neutral
1358,Thanks!,Neutral
1359," Hi, how are you?",Happy
1359," I am good, and you?  Do you read poetry?  It has it start date back in prehistoric times you know.",Neutral
1359,I do not. I heard there is a poem that when read is depressing but when read backwards is inspiring. How cool!,Surprised
1359,That is really cool.  I wonder who wrote that and how they came up with it.,Neutral
1359," Someone much smarter than I. Kind of like the person who does the javanese alphabet. When recited in order, it forms a poem.",Surprised
1359," That's interesting, especially since i have no idea what country speaks javanese!  I do like the Epic of Gilgamesh, it was written in Sumerian.",Neutral
1359," Me neither. I do not know either of those languages. But to be fair, my english isn't the best either...",Happy
1359," Are you familiar with the Homer epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey?  Ancient Greeks said poetry could be rhetoric, drama, song, and even comedy.",Neutral
1359,I read those in High School but I retained none of it. Edgar allan poe only got $9 for the raven,Surprised
1359,I've heard that before and I still can't believe it.  The Raven is read/studied in school and he only gets that for writing it?  What a shame.,Neutral
1359,Demetri Martin wrote a palindrome poem with 224 words in it!,Surprised
1359,I wonder what it was about.  Do you listen to music?  Linkin Park's hybrid theory is the best selling album of the 21st century.,Neutral
1359,I love linkin park. Do you listen to them?,Happy
1359,I do every now and then.  I was impressed to learn they have the best selling album.,Neutral
1359,Me too. They toured when the album came out for like 340 days one year.,Surprised
1359,Cool!  So do you listen to vinyl lps or just digitals?,Neutral
1359,Just digitals. I do not care that much about music to buy LPs. I would scratch the records or break them... You?,Curious to dive deeper
1359,Just digitals.  I'm not sure if an lp player is expensive or not since they are from back in the day.  For history sake I would like to hear one of those book albums from before 1948 that i've heard about.,Neutral
1359,Maybe Reel Big Fish could re-record their catalog on LPs...,Surprised
1359," Possibly.  Anything is possible.  I mean, a set of twins in japan released a rap album in 1992 when they were 100 years old.",Neutral
1359,Nice chatting with you!,Happy
1360,Have you ever played golf?,Curious to dive deeper
1360," Yes, I have in college and just for fun after college. Yes, the golf game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes.",Curious to dive deeper
1360," I understand every course is different, is that correct?",Curious to dive deeper
1360," Well, each hole on the course must contain a tee box to start from, and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup (4.25"" in diameter).  So, I don't know what your question is after.",Curious to dive deeper
1360," I meant that the actual layout of the holes and course - distance, hazards and such are different between any two courses.",Surprised
1360," Yes, no doubt.  I do that the average American golf course consumes around 312,000 gallons of water per day.",Curious to dive deeper
1360,Wow!     Courses in the desert must require a lot more water!,Surprised
1360," Probably There's a golf course in Dubai that requires 4,000,000 gallons of water a day!",Curious to dive deeper
1360,That seems excessive.     Must make it easy for avid golfers like Samuel L. Jackson.,Happy
1360," He must love the game. Speaking of different golf courses, there are other standard forms of terrain in between the hole and the putting greens.  There are fairways, rough (long grass), bunkers (or sand traps), and various hazards (like water or rocks) but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement.",Curious to dive deeper
1360,That is good to know.      It is funny Babe Ruth was once America's most famous Baseball Player and Golfer!,Surprised
1360," Wow, good to know.  Golf courses in America, incidentally,  make up more land space than Rhode Island and Delaware combined.",Curious to dive deeper
1360,I wonder how many animals find their way onto golf courses?,Happy
1360,Good question. Did you know that the study of animals is called zoology?,Curious to dive deeper
1360,That is cool.     There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on the planet.,Surprised
1360," True, that's a lot of critters. Did you know that in 2002, Germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally guaranteed legal rights?",Curious to dive deeper
1360," That is pretty crazy, but I guess I understand.    Many human behaviors came from animals.",Surprised
1360," Yes, that's true.  Did you know that hiccups are a holdover from the early evolution when early land animals had both gills and lungs?",Curious to dive deeper
1360,I wonder if the Loch Ness monster (assuming Nessie is real) has both gills and lungs?,Happy
1360," I'm not sure but I do know that under the provisions of the 1912 Scottish protection of animals act, the Loch Ness monster is a protected species.",Curious to dive deeper
1360," Cool.     I am a fan of animals, particularly those with white spots on their forehead.",Happy
1360," Yes, me too. I've never seen an animal with white spots on their forehead but it's been nice chatting with you.",Curious to dive deeper
1361,I love animals. Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
1361," Yes, I do too!",Happy
1361,Did you know that there are over 1.5 million species?,Curious to dive deeper
1361," That's impressive and probably that or more that are no longer around, anymore.  It's sad what we do to our environment.",Sad
1361,I absolutely agree. About 1 million of those species are insects.,Neutral
1361,I live in Florida and about half of them are here with me!,Surprised
1361," Ha ha, probably. As far as individually, there are about 20 quintillion individual animals on earth. I can't even wrap my head around that number. ",Surprised
1361,I was thinking the same thing!  Wow does quintillion come after billion?,Curious to dive deeper
1361,I'm actually not sure. Because of my love of animals I wish we would do what Germany did. They were the first country to give animals legal rights.,Happy
1361,I agree with that.  I hear that under Scottish law even the Loch Ness monster is a protected species.,Surprised
1361," Ha ha, I can't imagine how that came about. ",Happy
1361," Me either, but nice to know it's protected.  Have you been to any good concerts, lately?",Curious to dive deeper
1361,I think the last concert I was at was about 5 years ago. I used to go more often though.,Neutral
1361," Cool, the last one I went to was Merle Haggard.  My elderly dad is a big fan and I took him for his birthday.  It was the only concert he ever went to and he loved it!  ",Happy
1361," Awww, that's so nice. I'm glad he had fun. Did you know that in 2001 Linkin Park played 324 concerts?!",Surprised
1361," That seems like a lot, must have been on the road continuously!",Surprised
1361,Yes. That would be insanely exhausting. I can't imagine. Did you know that the Ramones also played a lot of concerts?,Curious to dive deeper
1361," I have read that they toured almost non stop for over 20 years, which must be some kind of record or something.  Just incredible!",Surprised
1361,Yes they did. They were such a fun band.,Happy
1361,Have you heard that Creed had a lawsuit filed against them by a couple of concertgoers?,Curious to dive deeper
1361,I did not. Why?,Curious to dive deeper
1361," Apparently, it was so bad.  The lead singer was so intoxicated/ high he couldn't remember the words to none of their songs, much less be able to sing them.  ",Neutral
1361,Oh wow. They deserve their money back then. It was nice chatting with you.,Neutral
1362,hi how are you? do you like poetry?,Neutral
1362," I am well, and yes I do like poety but I do not know a lot about it",Happy
1362,I am not a big fan of poetry. I am not smart enough to understand it. who is your favorite poet?,Neutral
1362,Poe is the one that comes to mind quickest.  It is funny he only was paid 9 bucks for the Raven,Surprised
1362," he wrote great stories. I guess I read the raven in high school. it was a fun poem but again, a bit too abstruse for me.",Neutral
1362,I think it is amazing they can trace poetry from all the way back to 25th century BC,Surprised
1362," I bet human beings have always played with words and made stories in different forms. Demetri martin wrote a 224 word palindrome poem. how long did it take him to write that, I wonder.",Neutral
1362,I do not know but I bet it was good.  Demetri Martin is a funny guy.  I have one of his comedy albums among my many music and comedy CDs,Curious to dive deeper
1362,I dont know his stuff. he sounds great. have you ever listened to dark side of the moon?,Neutral
1362," Oh yeah, even though it came out half a century ago, it is still really popular",Curious to dive deeper
1362," Yeah, it is still a best seller. have you ever tried dark side of oz?",Neutral
1362," No, I am not familiar with that?  Is it related to Dark Side of the Moon?",Curious to dive deeper
1362," Yeah, you use dark side as the soundtrack for wizard of oz. start the album at a certain point in the film. I never tried it.",Neutral
1362,That sounds pretty trippy.  I have been getting into rap recently.  I really enjoy Straight Outta Compton,Happy
1362,i only know one or two songs from the album. it was a huge album.,Neutral
1362,It reached platinum status and did not even have much radio play,Curious to dive deeper
1362,i cant imagine that album on the radio. the language was pretty rough. great tunes though. i know that the bush administration hated it. LOL,Neutral
1362," Rap music led to rap/rock like Linkin Park, which had the highest selling album of this century.  I am a fan of theirs as well",Happy
1362," They also did a lot of intense touring in the first year. quite a band. too bad about the lead singer. Anyway, great chat!",Neutral
1362,Yes it was good talking to you,Happy
1362,Have a great day!,Neutral
1362," You too, fun talking about music and poetry with you",Happy
1363,Hello! Are you into rap music?,Surprised
1363,no im not really into rap. do you listen to rap?,Neutral
1363,I do sometimes when I'm in the mood. I do like the history of it!,Curious to dive deeper
1363,i do not know much about the history of the genre. i know that it has grown fast in popularity.,Neutral
1363,It really has! Even judges rap to people like Eminem in court.,Surprised
1363,i wonder if he would be impressed by that. can judges do a good job rapping? can they spit fire?,Neutral
1363,I'm sure they drop the ruling like it's going out of style! Did you know Busta Rhymes voiced Reptar in the Rugrats?,Surprised
1363,i think busta was in a couple of movies too. he seems to be a multi talented guy.,Neutral
1363,He does! I wonder what happened to him? I like him better than Kanye West!,Surprised
1363,i think that he is more humble than kanye. kanye has some odd ideas too.,Neutral
1363,He thinks AIDS is a man-made disease.,Curious to dive deeper
1363," yes, the guy has got some weird ideas. recently they might have found a cure. i bet kanye would have something to say about that too.",Neutral
1363,Oh I'm sure he does! He did once give his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at a concert so he gets some credit from me haha.,Surprised
1363,i guess he can find his heart from time to time. he did meet with the president. i bet they could do an album together. LOL,Neutral
1363,That would be interesting and scary to say the least! I want to be famous someday so I can see the secret room at pixar!,Happy
1363,i would like to see it too. i wonder if there is a list of people who have seen it. it sounds interesting.,Neutral
1363,I bet it's like an old couch and sega genesis in there haha. It seems like more and more celebs do animation work these days.,Curious to dive deeper
1363," yeah, a small fridge. some beer neon signs. yeah. nothing special except its exclusive. true.",Neutral
1363,And it's probably Busch Light too haha. I wish I was getting that Judge Judy money!,Surprised
1363,she must have millions by this point. i dont know how many years she has done it but she has a distinct style.,Neutral
1363," She really does! I'll go look to see what she is worth. It was great chatting with you, have an awesome day!",Curious to dive deeper
1364,Hi do you like rap music?,Curious to dive deeper
1364," Yea I like old school rap, I never knew there were rappers who used sign language",Surprised
1364," I didn't know that either.  There's a form of freestyle rap called ""compliment battle"" that was invented by Korean rappers.  First time I've ever heard about that.",Happy
1364," Sounds like a bad time. The rapper Noclue can rap at 14.1 syllables per second, I don't even know how anyone could understand what he is rapping ",Surprised
1364,Only the people who can understand 14.1 syllables per second...so not many people. lol,Happy
1364," Well Noclue could making a bunch of money referencing big macs, McDonalds pays rappers $5 each time they do",Neutral
1364," Nice I didn't know that.  Before he became a rapper, Eminem's true dream was to become a comic book artist.",Happy
1364," Me neither, I also didn't know Donald Glover got his rap name from an online wu-tang clan name generator",Surprised
1364," Neat!  I didn't know that either. lol  In 2001, a Michigan judge deliverd her ruling in the form of a rap when trying a suit filed against Eminem.  Bet that was funny to hear.",Happy
1364," Sounds funny, or awkward. It's pretty cool that the singer of the pokemon theme also worked with Michael Jackson on the song ""Black and White"" ",Neutral
1364,Nice!  Busta Rhymes voiced the reptar wagon in the 1998 Rugrats movie.,Happy
1364," Lol, that's crazy. Did you know an Arctic Monkeys' performance was cancelled on Jimmy Kimmel Live because Kayne West wouldn't stop talking?",Curious to dive deeper
1364,haha I believe it!  Kanye believes that aids is a man-made disease.,Happy
1364,Doesn't surprise me. Pretty ironic Kayne did a skit of snl interrupting an award show 2 years before he interrupted Taylor Swift,Neutral
1364," Yes!  Out of the top 10 most successful songs of all time, only Kanye West's ""Gold Digger"" is in a minor key.",Happy
1364," Interesting, I know Evel Knievel sued Kayne over his ""touch the sky"" music video",Neutral
1364,No way!  Kanye once gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at a concert.  Nice thing he did there.,Happy
1364," That's pretty nice of him to do, I wonder if that was before or after the Taylor Swift incident",Curious to dive deeper
1364,I'm not sure.  I didn't realize that Kanye West was born in 1977.  I thought he was younger than that.  Anyhow...it was nice chatting with you!,Happy
1364," I never knew Swift is 2 inches taller than Kayne, well have a good one",Neutral
1364,I didn't know that.  You have a good day!,Happy
1365," Hello, so what do you think about Kanyes comments?",Curious to dive deeper
1365,About which thing ha ha. I'm generally opposed to all of his comments. His most recent that sticks out to me were his comments about slavery.,Curious to dive deeper
1365,I agre lol he does talk a lot of nonsense and specifically his comments about slavery,Curious to dive deeper
1365," Yes, those were appalling statements. To my recollection he said that slavery was a choice which is disgusting. ",Angry
1365,I think Bryant took a good position I thought he was going to be angrier because of those comments,Surprised
1365,I was glad to hear that Bryant spoke out about it. Are you a fan of rap?,Curious to dive deeper
1365," Yes I am, I like the rhythmic speech that it has, what about you?",Curious to dive deeper
1365," I do like the older stuff, not so much the new stuff. Tupac Shakur's music is in the library of congress. ",Curious to dive deeper
1365," Yeah old music was better and not only rap but in general, have you heard of Busta Rhymes?",Curious to dive deeper
1365,I certainly have. He is very talented. I don't think I've heard anyone rap faster.,Neutral
1365,He is fast! and he was the voice of the reptar wagon in the Rugrats movie back in 1998,Curious to dive deeper
1365,I was not aware of that. Apparently Eminem wanted to be a comic book artist. I wonder if he still draws?,Curious to dive deeper
1365," Good thing he dedicated himself to rap, I heard his favorite hero is Spiderman",Curious to dive deeper
1365,I had heard that as well. When a judge made a ruling in an Eminem case she did it in the form of a rap. I wish she wouldn't have done that. Seems so embarrassing and unnecessary.,Sad
1365," I agree I feel bad for her, I guess celebrities have a bigger influence than what I thought.",Curious to dive deeper
1365,Apparently. Korean rappers are a thing which surprises me also. They even came up with a new form of freestyle.,Surprised
1365,Really and what is the name of that freestyle form?,Curious to dive deeper
1365,It's called compliment battle. I don't know much about it but I'm assuming that instead of insults it's compliments which is so strange to me.,Surprised
1365," It is, I might have to google that lol, did you know that Pixar Studios has a secret room.",Happy
1365,I did not. What is the purpose of that?,Curious to dive deeper
1365," Im not sure but only certain celebrities have access to it, I guess its like a VIP room.",Curious to dive deeper
1366," hi, do you like rap?",Curious to dive deeper
1366," Yo, word up. I'm all. like, flowing with rhytmical delivery here ya'll.  Ok, so I'm an old white dude, but I still like rap. You? ",Happy
1366,yeah I like it too. do you like eminem?,Curious to dive deeper
1366,A bit harsh for me. I like rap that harkens back to the day when praise singers would use their art form to disseminate positive info. You?,Happy
1366,yeah I agree. Eminem though did not dream of becoming a rapper originally,Curious to dive deeper
1366," Really? When did he unwrap his rap gift? I'm not sure he will ever be listed in the librabry of congress under ""cultural significances"" but he has talent.",Happy
1366,yeah he is not up there with tupac but he wanted to be a comic book artist,Curious to dive deeper
1366," EEveryone wants to be a rapper at times. A michigan judge once delivered a verdict in rap, when ruling over a case involving Eminem. I wonder if that judge was a better rapper than a judge?",Happy
1366," I would have liked to hear that actually. how about busta rhymes, do you like him?",Curious to dive deeper
1366," I don't know if I have heard him, other than as the reptar wagon in the Rugrats movie... I would live to hear some Korean rap!",Happy
1366,yeah one of those compliment rap battels?,Curious to dive deeper

1366," Yeah for sure, funny guy too. do you know the Pixar stdio?",Curious to dive deeper
1366,I have never been there. You?,Happy
1366," No, I am not a celebrity so apparently I cannot visit their secret room",Curious to dive deeper
1366,Carol Burnett was the first celebrity that visited Sesame Street. Ever been there?,Happy
1366,I have not actually. do you know judge judy?,Curious to dive deeper
1366,Don't tell me you have been there! What was your case about? LOL I hear she pulls down over 100 grand per episode. Not bad!,Happy
1366," yeah, she is the second person to make more than LeBron James",Curious to dive deeper
1366," I would love to be in his shoes, although they would fit me... Maybe I could fit in Carol Burnett's shoes",Happy
1366,hahaa good one. nice chat,Happy

1368,I love his newest album. I listen to his songs as I study for my exams.I do listen the Lamar and Drake.,Neutral
1368," Oh, cool. I like some rap but I don't listen a lot. It is crazy how much money celebrity's make, even judge Judy makes 123,000 bucks per episode....I suppose Rapper's and Celebrity's make a lot more but they do a lot more too.",Surprised
1368,Who is your favorite rapper celebrity? Judge Judy is ending soon and it seems so great for her because it is close to her retirement year. It is a ridiculous amount of money.,Neutral
1368," For me I would say Wiz Khalifa or P.Diddy. Tupac. Those are who come to mind. Some of the newer rappers are good, some bad. Kanye West has had a few good albums , I do have to give him that.",Happy
1368,Tupac is the LEGEND! I love his song Ghost Town though.,Neutral
1368,That's a good one. I like Keep ya Head Up. a lot. So many rappers now it's hard to keep track lol. Do you like Kanye West?,Curious to dive deeper

1368," I did not know that Drake was caring, or was it for the video?",Curious to dive deeper
1368," What do you mean? I think Drake is an awesome person. I have read a lot about how much he wants to be a great Dad. But who knows I guess,lol....celebrity's have to always look and act their best.",Happy
1368,I see that you know more about Drake than me. I should not give my opinion then. It was my first time watching one of his music videos.,Neutral
1368," Oh, haha, I don't know too much about him either. I do know that Tupac Shakur's music is considered to be of cultural significance, he was amazing!",Happy
1368,His art is mainly poetry.,Neutral
1368,Yes! It is so sad still to this day that he is gone. I guess some korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle rap called a compliment battle....That would be interesting to hear. It has been great chatting with you!!,Happy

1370,Good morning!  Do you follow baseball?,Surprised
1370," Not really, if it's not in movie format I have a hard time following sports. But I do know that it's super popular in Japan isn't it?",Neutral
1370,Yes!  Probably bigger there than in the US.  It's so popular there that many fans are surprised to discover it's status as America's national pastime.  (which I think isn't the case any longer),Happy
1370,You're right America's pastime is probably football or videogames these days haha. One of the things about baseball that has always interested me is how baseball cards hold value somehow. I read about a man who found three million dollars worth of 1900's baseball cards in his grandfather's attic. What a weird thing to be worth money!,Curious to dive deeper
1370,Isn't that sad about videogames?  Baseball cards used to be worth way more too!  Ironically before videogames exploded in popularity.  Kids don't do the activities and hobbies they used to do.,Happy
1370," Something that confuses me is that softball, is the faster version of baseball and was originally designed to be played indoors. Indoors! What kind of place could handle better being hit by a softball than a baseball?!",Curious to dive deeper
1370," lol  I remember when I was little for some reason we always played softball in the gym and not outside.  Did you know that the YMCA invented volleyball, softball, and basketball?",Happy
1370," Oh man I've never heard that! I guess that makes sense in a way because they are indoor sports locations but that is interesting. Volleyball is shocking though that seems like it would have been invented at a beach, right?",Curious to dive deeper
1370," You would think. lol  On May 11, 1991 Creighton played Utah in the longest game in NCAA softball history.  The game lasted 31 innings!",Happy
1370," UGH! I was stuck at a long baseball game like that once, we left at some point to beat traffic and when we got home the game was STILL ON TV. Those teams must have either been really good or really terrible to make the game last that long, right?",Curious to dive deeper
1370,lol  Yes...I remember one game like that from a few years ago.,Happy
1370," I didn't know there were pro leagues either, also I'm hoping thats per month or something, otherwise there wouldn't be many people interested right? haha",Curious to dive deeper
1370,Right! lol  Jose Canseco claims to hold the record for longest softball homerun at 622 feet!,Happy
1370," 622 feet is FAR! I'd love to see what that looked like! Did you know that kickball is called ""soccer-baseball"" in Canada? Are any of the kickball rules the same? I can't remember at all, it's been so long since I've played",Curious to dive deeper
1370,I have no idea on that!  I haven't played since elementary school.  lol,Happy
1370," I wonder why they wouldn't just call it kickball, soccer-baseball is so long!",Curious to dive deeper
1370," I don't know.  lol  Softball was invented in 1887 in Chicago, IL.",Happy
1370,I wonder when the YMCA was founded if they invented softball and softball was invented in 1887,Curious to dive deeper
1370,Whoa!  1844 I just looked it up.  lol  The first sporting event shown on ESP was a slow pitch softball game!,Happy
1370," That's interesting, I wonder why they picked that to be the first sport on ESPN, was is hugely popular at that time? Or maybe just cheap to get since they don't seem to pay their athletes that much",Curious to dive deeper
1370," I'm thinking probably because it was cheap to get.  Since ESPN was new, they probably didn't have a big budget. lol  It was fun chatting with you!  ",Happy
1370,You're probably right. Nice chatting with you!,Neutral
1370,Have a great day!,Happy
1371,Maryland Lt. Governor Boyd Rutherford is running for reelection.,Neutral
1371," Yes, and it sounds like he's a unique kind of conservative - dry and focused on the fiscal issues.",Curious to dive deeper
1371,Rutherford actually cares about the details of running the government,Neutral
1371," Yes, and I think that's great. Refreshing in today's world.",Curious to dive deeper
1371,What other Lt. Governors would lead a commission on regulatory and procurement reform?,Curious to dive deeper
1371," Yes. Or have a video series called ""Mundane (But Meaningful)""?",Curious to dive deeper
1371,He even made an on-the-fly correction to the title of the Maryland code in the script.,Neutral
1371," Yes, he really seems to know his stuff. Maybe he'll be an inspiration for other politicians.",Curious to dive deeper
1371,Politics these days seems to be about personalities.  This is a refreshing change.,Happy
1371," Yes, for sure. As the governor's office is saying, boring can sell.",Curious to dive deeper
1371,Rutherford doesn't have the most exciting background,Neutral
1371,You don't say? That doesn't sound boring at all. Did you know that he started out as an Independent and then became a Democrat for a while?,Curious to dive deeper
1371,Changing political parties. Sounds similar to Teddy Roosevelt changing parties when he ran on the Bull Moose party.,Neutral
1371," Yes, but Rutherford became a Republican early on. Being a Democrat was just a phase. He's been a Republican for more than 20 years now.",Curious to dive deeper
1371,He has the experience.  He even filled in for public appearances when Gov. Hogan was being treated for cancer.,Neutral
1371," Yes. I'm finding him to be a very appealing character, reading about him. We need more facts these days. Facts, facts, facts.",Curious to dive deeper
1371,He relishes the opportunity to talk about his daily work.,Neutral
1371,Which is great! Too many politicians just want to pose for the cameras and live the good life these days. He's an attorney by training so he understands the law.,Curious to dive deeper
1371," He wore a gray sweater for the video series, not a power suit like other politicians would.",Happy
1371,Yes. He's sending a message that he's humble and he knows his stuff. I hope others follow his lead.,Curious to dive deeper
1371,That would be great for the country.,Happy
1372," Hello, do you know the GOP stands for grand old party?",Curious to dive deeper
1372," No, didn't know that, that's like an abbreviation of the Republican party right?",Surprised
1372,Yeah after the American Revolutions major ideology.,Curious to dive deeper
1372,It was founded by anti slavery activist right? do you consider yourself a Republican?,Curious to dive deeper
1372,I consider myself independent because I think both sides have good points.,Curious to dive deeper
1372,I consider myself a republican but its good to have several points of view,Curious to dive deeper
1372," Yeah, I vote both candidates depending on their stances haha.",Curious to dive deeper
1372,Did you like Richard Nixon? he was the only president to propuse a minimum income law,Curious to dive deeper
1372," He was before my time, but I would have supported that and still do!",Curious to dive deeper
1372," I think that was a great thing, yeah, I would support that as well, Hillary Clinton used to be a Republican",Curious to dive deeper
1372,I think a lot of people switched to Republicans due to the conservatism stance of Democrats.,Curious to dive deeper
1372," Yeah, that is a valid reason, what do you think of our current government",Curious to dive deeper
1372,I am unsure...I think there is a lot of unrest and controversy that is for sure.,Curious to dive deeper
1372," A lot of controversy I agree, well there are other goverments that have it worse, like the Chinese goverment, they tend to censor everything",Curious to dive deeper
1372,Wikileaks said the government is trying to destroy them.,Curious to dive deeper
1372," They did? I think its funny how they expose the goverments plan to destroy them lol, ",Curious to dive deeper
1372," I like the norwegian government, they donate a billion to save the rain forest.",Curious to dive deeper
1372," Thats a lot of money!! seems like the Norwegian government really cares about the environment, ",Curious to dive deeper
1372,Our government should bring back the beatles song come together again and unite!,Curious to dive deeper
1372," It should, you know the US government actually publishes the names of those who renounce to their citizenship!",Curious to dive deeper
1372,Nice talk...take care!,Curious to dive deeper
1372," The goverment has also shut down 17 times  in the past 37 years, this year was terrible though, nice chat!",Curious to dive deeper
